 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position 

coronavirus disease risks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has and may continue to impact our operations which may impact our results and our financial condition 

the spread of covid19 created a global health crisis that resulted in widespread disruption to economic activity both in the us and globally 

we operate facilities in the united states and around the world which have been and may continue to be adversely affected by this pandemic including the closure or reduced capacity of certain of our facilities delays or disruptions in our ability to source raw materials components and products constraints in shipping transportation and logistics and decreased employee availability due to the uncertain duration of the covid19 pandemic we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact it may have on the markets in which we operate or our business the extent of such impact will depend on a number of factors including the duration of the covid19 pandemic its effect on our customers suppliers and employees its effect on domestic and international economies and markets including consumer discretionary spending and the response of governmental authorities a prolonged disruption of our operations or slowdown in domestic and international economic activity could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

to the extent covid19 continues to impact our business and our operations it may also have the effect of heightening certain of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k such as those relating to our international operations and global strategies and our dependence on thirdparty suppliers 

strategic risks 

our business strategy is focused on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity both of which are impacted by a number of economic factors and other factors 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity a number of factors impact consumers’ spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity including 

• consumer confidence levels 

• fluctuations in home prices 

• existing home sales 

• unemployment and underemployment levels 

• consumer income and debt levels 

• household formation 

• the availability of skilled tradespeople for repair and remodeling work 

• the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for and tax deductibility of such loans 

• trends in lifestyle and housing design and 

• natural disasters terrorist acts pandemics or other catastrophic events 

the fundamentals driving our business are impacted by economic cycles adverse changes or uncertainty involving the factors listed above an economic contraction or inflationary pressures could result in a decline in residential repair and remodeling activity or in demand for new home construction which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives of investing in our brands developing innovative products and focusing on operational excellence through the masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity these initiatives are designed to grow revenue improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid to longterm our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization 

we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy or integrate businesses that we acquire 

pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions within a desired time frame or at acceptable terms and prices our longterm competitive positioning may be affected even if we are successful in acquiring businesses the businesses we acquire may not be able to achieve the revenue profitability or growth we anticipate or we may experience challenges and risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business such risks include 

• difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale 

• diversion of management attention and our resources 

• unforeseen liabilities 

• issues or conflicts with our new or existing customers or suppliers and 

• difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses 

international acquisitions that we have made and international acquisitions that we may make in the future may continue to increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

business and operational risks 

variability in the cost and availability of our raw materials component parts and finished goods could affect our results of operations and financial position 

we purchase substantial amounts of raw materials component parts and finished goods from outside sources including international sources and we manufacture certain of our products outside of the united states increases in the cost of the materials we purchase including as a result of availability tariffs and inflation have in the past and may in the future increase the prices for our products further our production could be affected if we or our suppliers are unable to procure our requirements for various commodities including among others brass resins titanium dioxide and zinc or if a shortage of these commodities results in significantly increased costs rising energy costs could also increase our production and transportation costs in addition water is a significant component of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to shortages and restrictions on supply in certain regions due to climaterelated and other influences these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

it can be difficult for us to pass on to customers our cost increases our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to sufficiently increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased material and production costs our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected increased selling prices for our products have and may in the future lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if those prices are not competitive when our material costs decline we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices such reductions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

from time to time we enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of the commodities we require to produce our products and to establish firm pricing but at times these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract occasionally we may also use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which has occurred and could occur in the future and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers and service providers 

we are dependent on third parties for many of our products and components and for certain services our ability to offer a wide variety of products and provide high levels of service to our customers depend on our ability to obtain an adequate and timely supply of products and components failure of our suppliers to timely provide us quality products or services on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or our supplier business practices policies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position or could damage our reputation the operations of the third parties we depend on could be impacted by changing laws regulations and policies including those related to climate change labor availability and by adverse weather conditions pandemics and other force majeure events any of which could result in disruptions to their operations and result in shortages of supply assertion of force majeure contract provisions and increases in the prices they charge for the raw materials components and products they produce sourcing these products and components from alternate suppliers including suppliers from new geographic regions or reengineering our products as a result of supplier disruptions is timeconsuming and costly and could result in inefficiencies or delays in our business operations or could negatively impact the quality of our products in addition the loss of critical suppliers or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers has and could continue to disrupt our business and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

many of the suppliers we rely upon are located in foreign countries primarily china the differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements changes in economic conditions and trade policies and laws and regulations together with the limited number of suppliers have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling we have experienced and may continue to experience constraints on and disruptions to transporting our raw materials components and products from our international suppliers and have had to pay higher transportation costs if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain or if we continue to experience such transportation constraints disruptions and higher costs for timely delivery of our products or components our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

there are risks associated with our international operations and global strategies 

in 2021 21 percent of our sales from continuing operations were made outside of north america principally in europe and transacted in currencies other than the us dollar in addition to our european operations we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties globally risks associated with our international operations include 

• differences in culture economic and labor conditions and practices 

• the policies of the us and foreign governments 

• disruptions in trade relations and economic instability 

• differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 

• timeliness of transportation and port congestion 

• social and political unrest and 

• natural disasters terrorist attacks pandemics or other catastrophic events 

we are also affected by domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to companies doing business abroad or importing and exporting goods and materials these include tax laws laws regulating competition antibriberyanticorruption and other business practices and trade regulations including duties and tariffs compliance with these laws is costly and future changes to these laws may require significant management attention and disrupt our operations additionally while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure significant changes in how us and foreign jurisdictions tax crossborder transactions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our results of operations and financial position are also impacted by changes in currency exchange rates unfavorable currency exchange rates particularly the euro the chinese yuan renminbi the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling have in the past adversely affected us and could adversely affect us in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

additionally as a result of the united kingdoms exit from the european union we could experience volatility in the currency exchange rates or a change in the demand for our products and services particularly in our uk and european markets or there could be disruption of our operations and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented and diverse personnel 

to be successful we must invest significant resources to attract develop and retain highly qualified talented and diverse employees at all levels who have the experience knowledge and expertise to implement our strategic and business initiatives we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we may fail in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them particularly when there are low unemployment levels we have been and continue to be affected by a shortage of qualified personnel in certain geographic areas our growth competitive position results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected by our failure to attract develop and retain key employees and diverse talent to build strong leadership teams to successfully implement our talent strategies or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess 

extreme weather events and changes in climate could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

extreme weather events such as severe winter and other storms hurricanes fires floods tornados and droughts as a result of climate change or other factors have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our business these types of events can be disruptive to our operations and may impact consumer spending in addition we have certain suppliers located in areas that have experienced extreme weather events which have impacted and may continue to impact the availability and cost of some of our raw materials components and products from time to time if the frequency or severity of extreme weather increases we may experience interruptions to our operations further impact on our supply chain increased operating costs or loss or damage to our property or inventory which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility 

we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement and in order to borrow under it we cannot be in default with any of those provisions our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be affected if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants in the past we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement our financial flexibility could be restricted 

competitive risks 

we could lose market share if we do not maintain our strong brands develop innovative products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences or if our reputation is damaged 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products our initiatives to invest in brand building brand awareness and product innovation may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing innovative and improved products such as gauging changing consumer demands and preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing selling and servicing these products may impact the success of our product introductions if the products we introduce do not gain widespread acceptance or if our competitors improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do we could lose market share or be required to reduce our prices which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

in recent years consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers’ business models and strategies have changed as our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure including maintaining robust and userfriendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and providing comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development if we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers or if our customers are unable to successfully execute their strategies our brands may lose market share 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to changing consumer preferences including among others a continued shift in consumer purchasing practices toward ecommerce and increased consumer demand for products with potential desired attributes such as connected products and sustainable products our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed our ability to retain our customers and consumers may be negatively impacted the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our public image and reputation are important to maintaining our strong brands and could be adversely affected by various factors including product quality and service claims and comments in social media or the press or a negative perception regarding our company practices positions or public statements including regarding disputes or legal action against us even if unfounded damage to our public image or reputation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we face significant competition and operate in an evolving competitive landscape 

our products face significant competition we believe that brand reputation is an important factor affecting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features innovation quality customer service warranty and price we sell many of our products through home center retailers online retailers distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers our success with our customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery in addition home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly selling directly to professional contractors and installers this shift may adversely affect our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers and as home center retailers develop customer experience programs to attract and retain contractors and installers they may rely on us to support their efforts which may affect our growth and operating results 

certain of our customers are selling products sourced from lowcost foreign manufacturers under their own private label brands which directly compete with our brands as a result of this trend we have and we may in the future experience lower demand for our products or a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more valuepriced or opening price point products which may affect our operating results 

in addition we face competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace including sales promotion programs that could affect our market share or result in price reductions which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

further the growing ecommerce channel brings an increased number of competitors and greater pricing transparency for consumers as well as conflicts between our existing distribution channels and a need for different distribution methods these factors could affect our results of operations and financial position in addition our relationships with our customers including our home center customers may be affected if we increase the amount of business we transact in the ecommerce channel 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our sales are concentrated with three significant customers and this concentration may continue to increase in 2021 our net sales from our continuing operations to the home depot were 30 billion approximately 36 percent of our consolidated net sales and our net sales from our continuing operations to ferguson and lowe’s were each less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales these customers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them additionally these customers have in the past and may in the future reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us although other retailers dealers distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services we might not be able to quickly replace if at all the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to either ferguson or lowe’s and any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our behr business grants behr brand exclusivity in the retail sales channel in north america to the home depot and from time to time certain of our other businesses grant product andor brand exclusivity to our customers the granting of exclusivity affects our ability to sell those products and brands to other customers and can increase the complexity of our product offerings and can increase our costs 

technology and intellectual property risks 

we rely on information systems and technology and a breakdown of these systems or interruptions resulting from our implementation of new systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we rely on many information systems and technology to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities we may be adversely affected if our information systems breakdown fail or are no longer supported in addition to the consequences that may occur from interruptions in our current systems we continue to invest in new technology systems throughout our company including implementations of and upgrades to enterprise resource planning “erp” systems at our business units erp implementations and upgrades are complex and require significant management oversight and we have experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated expenses and interruptions to our operations during these implementations our results of operations and financial position as well as the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected if we do not appropriately select implement maintain and upgrade our technology systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation and upgrade of erp systems 

we have been and may continue to be subject to cybersecurity attacks which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more frequent sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems we have implemented security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations despite these efforts our systems have been and may in the future be damaged disrupted or shut down due to cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized access malware ransomware undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions have led and could in the future lead to business interruption production or operational downtime product shipment delays exposure or loss of proprietary confidential or financial information or the personal information of our employees or customers data corruption an inability to report our financial results in a timely manner damage to the reputation of our brands damage to our relationships with our customers and suppliers exposure to litigation and increased costs associated with the remediation and mitigation of such attacks in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers thirdparty suppliers or service providers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property has been and may again be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us current and former employees contractors customers or suppliers have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by them or disclosed to others including our competitors protecting and preventing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could be costly time consuming and require significant resources if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

litigation and regulatory risks 

claims and litigation could be costly

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations the issuance of notes in the financial markets bank borrowings and the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies our capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in our business balancing share repurchases with potential acquisitions and maintaining a meaningful dividend 

we had cash and cash investments of approximately 926 million and 13 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts time deposit accounts and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments of the cash and cash investments we held at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 490 million and 385 million respectively was held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us would not result in significant additional us income tax or foreign withholding tax as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our amended credit agreement are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities however due to the highly uncertain nature and duration or resurgence of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on our customer suppliers and employees we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact it may have on our future financial condition 

capital expenditures 

we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations of those businesses that align with our longterm growth strategy to increase our productivity improve customer service and support product innovation capital expenditures for 2021 were 128 million compared with 114 million for 2020 for 2022 capital expenditures excluding any potential future acquisitions are expected to be approximately 250 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2021 totaled 151 million compared with 133 million for 2020 for 2022 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential future acquisitions is expected to be approximately 150 million amortization expense totaled 40 million in 2021 compared with 28 million in 2020

other liquidity and capital resource activities 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity we work with suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions including extending payment terms we also facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program the program to provide certain of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions a third party administers the program our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution we do not enter into agreements with any of the participating financial institutions in connection with the program the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program 

all outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets the amounts owed to participating financial institutions under the program and included in accounts payable for our continuing operations were 43 million and 45 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we account for all payments made under the program as a reduction to our cash flows from operations and reported within our increase decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities net line within our consolidated statements of cash flows the amounts settled through the program and paid to participating financial institutions were 220 million and 146 million for our continuing operations during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively a downgrade in our credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions’ willingness to commit funds to and participate in the program we do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows as substantially all of our payments are made outside of the program 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro british pound the chinese renminbi and the us dollar occasionally we have also used derivative and hedging instruments to manage interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis we currently do not have any derivative instruments for which we have designated hedge accounting

we monitor our exposure for credit losses on customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of customers on an ongoing basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances where a risk of loss has been identified and also include a provision for losses based upon historical collection experience and writeoff activity as well as reasonable and supportable forecast information that considers macroeconomic factors and industryspecific trends associated with our businesses among others a separate allowance is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally based upon sales activity 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits and currently a two percent to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated repair and remodel activity and to a lesser extent estimated housing starts our assumptions included us and eurozone gross domestic product growing at approximately 38 percent and 45 percent respectively in 2022 and per annum over the fiveyear forecast 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 75 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows in 2021 based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 90 percent to 115 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we recognized a 45 million noncash goodwill impairment charge related to a reporting unit within our decorative architectural products segment due to competitive market conditions and higher inflationary costs in our lighting business as of december 31 2021 the impaired reporting unit had a remaining net goodwill balance of 19 million a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our other reporting units would not have resulted in any additional goodwill impairment 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of an other indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying value we utilize a relieffromroyalty model to estimate the fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm we also consider the profitability of the business among other factors to determine the royalty rate for use in the impairment assessment 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 75 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows in 2021 based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses and the nature of the trade name we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 100 percent to 155 percent for our other indefinitelived intangible assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for our other indefinitelived intangible assets were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our other indefinitelived intangibles assets would not have resulted in an impairment for any of our other indefinitelived intangible assets

income taxes 

deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

based upon all available evidence primarily threeyear cumulative loss positions in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions we determined that it is more likely than not certain deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result we maintain a 17 million valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2021

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have considered the provisions of accounting guidance regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes between the us dollar and the european euro british pound canadian dollar and chinese renminbi and to market price fluctuations related to our financial investments we have insignificant involvement with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

at december 31 2021 we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates a 10 percent decline in the market value of our longterm investments or a 100 basis point change in interest rates based upon the analyses performed such changes would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position 

coronavirus disease 2019 risks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic is disrupting our business and has and may continue to impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the spread of covid19 has created a global health crisis that has resulted in widespread disruption to economic activity both in the us and globally 

we operate facilities in the united states and around the world which are being adversely affected by this pandemic the us federal government and numerous state local and foreign governments implemented certain measures to attempt to slow and limit the spread of covid19 including shelterinplace and social distancing orders which are subject to change and the respective governmental authorities may tighten such restrictions at any time due to such measures we have experienced and may continue to experience the closure of certain of our facilities delays or disruptions in the supply of raw materials component parts and services and decreased employee availability which has resulted and may continue to result in delays in our ability to produce and distribute our products 

in addition covid19 has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect domestic and international economic activity including reduced consumer confidence instability in the credit and financial markets and reduced business and consumer spending which may adversely affect our results of operations economic uncertainly as a result of covid19 may also make it difficult for us and our customers and suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and may weaken the financial position of some of our suppliers and customers 

due to the uncertain nature and potential duration of the covid19 pandemic we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact it may have on the markets in which we operate or our business at this time the extent of such impact will depend on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic its effect on our customers suppliers and employees its effect on domestic and international economies and markets including consumer discretionary spending and the response of governmental authorities we are continuing to take action to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and operations including through cost reduction measures and other initiatives however the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts remains uncertain a continued disruption of our operations and an ongoing slowdown in domestic and international economic activity could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

to the extent covid19 continues to impact our business financial position and results of operations it may also have the effect of heightening certain of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k such as those relating to our international operations and global strategies our dependence on thirdparty suppliers and compliance with covenants under our credit facility 

strategic risks 

our business strategy is focused on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity both of which are impacted by a number of economic factors and other factors 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity a number of factors impact consumers’ spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity including 

• consumer confidence levels 

• fluctuations in home prices 

• existing home sales 

• unemployment and underemployment levels 

• consumer income and debt levels 

• household formation 

• the availability of skilled tradespeople for repair and remodeling work 

• the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for and tax deductibility of such loans 

• trends in lifestyle and housing design and 

• natural disasters terrorist acts pandemics or other catastrophic events 

the fundamentals driving our business are impacted by economic cycles adverse changes or uncertainty involving the factors listed above or an economic contraction in the united states and worldwide could result in a decline in spending on residential repair and remodeling activity and a decline in demand for new home construction which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives of investing in our brands developing innovative products and focusing on operational excellence through the masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity these initiatives are designed to grow revenue improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid to longterm our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization 

we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy or integrate businesses that we acquire 

pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions within a desired time frame or at acceptable terms and prices our longterm competitive positioning may be affected even if we are successful in acquiring businesses the businesses we acquire may not be able to achieve the revenue profitability or growth we anticipate or we may experience challenges and risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business such risks include 

• difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale 

• diversion of management attention and our resources 

• unforeseen liabilities 

• issues or conflicts with our new or existing customers or suppliers and 

• difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses 

future foreign acquisitions may also increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

business and operational risks 

variability in the cost and availability of our raw materials component parts and finished goods including the imposition of tariffs could affect our results of operations and financial position 

we purchase substantial amounts of raw materials component parts and finished goods from outside sources including international sources and we manufacture certain of our products outside of the united states increases in the cost of the materials we purchase have in the past and may in the future increase the prices for our products including as a result of new tariffs for example the continuing trade dispute between the united states and china has resulted in tariffs which raised the cost of certain of our materials there is a risk that additional tariffs on imports from china or new tariffs could be imposed which could further increase the cost of the materials we purchase or import or the products we manufacture internationally further our production could be affected if we or our suppliers are unable to procure our requirements for various commodities including among others brass resins titanium dioxide and zinc or if a shortage of these commodities results in significantly increased costs rising energy costs could also increase our production and transportation costs in addition water is a significant component of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

it can be difficult for us to pass on to customers our cost increases our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to sufficiently increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased material and production costs including the impact of increasing tariffs our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected increased selling prices for our products have and may in the future lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if those prices are not competitive when our material costs decline we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices such reductions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

from time to time we enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of the commodities we require to produce our products and to establish firm pricing but at times these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract occasionally we may also use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which has occurred and could occur in the future and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers for many of our products and components and our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate and timely supply of these products and components failure of our suppliers to timely provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or our policies regarding our supplier business practices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position or could damage our reputation sourcing these products and components from alternate suppliers including suppliers from new geographic regions is timeconsuming and costly and could result in inefficiencies or delays in our business operations accordingly the loss of critical suppliers or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

many of the suppliers we rely upon are located in foreign countries primarily china the differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements changes in economic conditions and trade policies and laws and regulations together with the limited number of suppliers have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain or if we experience constraints to or disruption in transporting the products or components or we have to pay higher transportation costs for timely delivery of our products or components our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

there are risks associated with our international operations and global strategies 

in 2020 19 percent of our sales from continuing operations were made outside of north america principally in europe and transacted in currencies other than the us dollar in addition to our european operations we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties globally risks associated with our international operations include 

• differences in culture economic and labor conditions and practices 

• the policies of the us and foreign governments 

• disruptions in trade relations and economic instability 

• differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 

• social and political unrest and 

• natural disasters terrorist attacks pandemics or other catastrophic events 

we are also affected by domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to companies doing business abroad or importing and exporting goods and materials these include tax laws laws regulating competition antibriberyanticorruption and other business practices and trade regulations including duties and tariffs compliance with these laws is costly and future changes to these laws may require significant management attention and disrupt our operations additionally while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure significant changes in how us and foreign jurisdictions tax crossborder transactions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our results of operations and financial position are also impacted by changes in currency exchange rates unfavorable currency exchange rates particularly the euro the chinese yuan renminbi the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling have in the past adversely affected us and could adversely affect us in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

additionally following the united kingdoms exit from the european union we could experience volatility in the currency exchange rates or a change in the demand for our products and services particularly in our uk and european markets or there could be disruption of our operations and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented and diverse personnel 

to be successful we must invest significant resources to attract develop and retain highly qualified talented and diverse employees at all levels who have the experience knowledge and expertise to implement our strategic initiatives we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we may fail in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them particularly when there are low unemployment levels from time to time we have been affected by a shortage of qualified personnel in certain geographic areas our growth competitive position and results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected by our failure to attract develop and retain key employees and diverse talent to build strong leadership teams or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess or by a shortage of qualified employees 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility 

we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement and in order to borrow under it we cannot be in default with any of those provisions our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be affected if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants in the past we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement our financial flexibility could be restricted

we could lose market share if we do not maintain our strong brands develop innovative products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences or if our reputation is damaged 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products our initiatives to invest in brand building brand awareness and product innovation may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing innovative and improved products such as gauging changing consumer demands and preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if the products we introduce do not gain widespread acceptance or if our competitors improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do we could lose market share or be required to reduce our prices which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

in recent years consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers’ business models and strategies have changed as our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure including maintaining robust and userfriendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and providing comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development if we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers or if our customers are unable to successfully execute their strategies our brands may lose market share 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to changing consumer preferences including a continued shift in consumer purchasing practices toward ecommerce our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our public image and reputation are important to maintaining our strong brands and could be adversely affected by various factors including product quality and service claims and comments in social media or the press or a negative perception regarding our company practices including regarding disputes or legal action against us even if unfounded damage to our public image or reputation could adversely affect our sales and results of operations and financial position 

we face significant competition and operate in an evolving competitive landscape 

our products face significant competition we believe that brand reputation is an important factor affecting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features innovation quality customer service warranty and price we sell many of our products through home center retailers online retailers distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers our success with our customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery in addition home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are selling directly to professional contractors and installers which may adversely affect our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

certain of our customers are selling products sourced from lowcost foreign manufacturers under their own private label brands which directly compete with our brands as this trend continues we may experience lower demand for our products or a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more valuepriced or opening price point products which may affect our profitability 

in addition we face competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace including sales promotion programs that could affect our market share or result in price reductions which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

further the growing ecommerce channel brings an increased number of competitors and greater pricing transparency for consumers as well as conflicts between our existing distribution channels and a need for different distribution methods these factors could affect our results of operations and financial position in addition our relationships with our customers including our home center customers may be affected if we increase the amount of business we transact in the ecommerce channel 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers and this concentration may continue to increase in 2020 our net sales from our continuing operations to the home depot were 28 billion approximately 39 percent of our consolidated net sales and our net sales from our continuing operations to lowe’s were less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales these home center retailers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them additionally these home center retailers may reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us although other retailers dealers distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services we might not be able to quickly replace if at all the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to lowe’s and any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition our behr business grants behr brand exclusivity in the retail sales channel in north america to the home depot and from time to time certain of our other businesses grant product andor brand exclusivity to our customers the granting of exclusivity affects our ability to sell those products and brands to other customers and can increase the complexity of our product offerings and can increase our costs 

technology and intellectual property risks 

we rely on information systems and technology and a breakdown of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we rely on many information systems and technology to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities we may be adversely affected if our information systems breakdown fail or are no longer supported in addition to the consequences that may occur from interruptions in our systems global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems 

we have implemented security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations despite these efforts our systems have been and may in the future be damaged disrupted or shut down due to cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized access malware ransomware undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions have led and could in the future lead to business interruption production or operational downtime product shipment delays exposure or loss of proprietary confidential personal or financial information data corruption an inability to report our financial results in a timely manner damage to the reputation of our brands damage to our relationships with our customers and suppliers exposure to litigation and increased costs associated with the remediation and mitigation of such attacks such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation 

we may not experience the anticipated benefits from our investments in new technology 

we continue to invest in new technology systems throughout our company including implementations of and upgrades to enterprise resource planning “erp” systems at our business units erp implementations and upgrades are complex and require significant management oversight and we have experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated expenses and interruptions to our operations during these implementations our results of operations and financial position as well as the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected if we do not appropriately select implement and upgrade our technology systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation and upgrade of erp systems 

we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property has been and may again be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us current and former employees contractors customers or suppliers have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by them or disclosed to others including our competitors protecting and defending our intellectual property could be costly time consuming and require significant resources if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

litigation and regulatory risks 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are involved in various claims and litigation including class actions mass torts and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have a material adverse effect on us the types of matters may include among others competition product liability employment warranty advertising contract personal injury environmental intellectual property product compliance and insurance coverage the outcome and effect of these matters are inherently unpredictable and defending and resolving them can be costly and can divert management’s attention we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of claims and litigation 

we are also subject to product safety regulations product recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant costs and regardless of the ultimate outcome create adverse publicity and damage the reputation of our brands and business also we rely on other manufacturers to provide products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products and components we source from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of the risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover our losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

refer to note u to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

compliance with laws government regulation and industry standards is costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to 

• securities matters 

• taxation 

• antibriberyanticorruption

• climate change and protection of the environment 

in addition to complying with current requirements and known future requirements even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future 

as we sell new types of products or existing products in new geographic areas or channels or for new applications we are subject to the requirements applicable to those sales additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with new or changed laws regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs our manufacturing processes our packaging or our sourcing these compliance activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as outlook believe anticipate appear may will should intend plan estimate expect assume seek forecast and similar references to future periods our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements 

in addition to the various factors included in the executive level overview critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections our future performance may be affected by the levels of residential repair and remodel activity and to a lesser extent new home construction our ability to maintain our strong brands and reputation and to develop innovative products our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries our reliance on key customers the length and severity of the ongoing covid19 pandemic including its impact on domestic and international economic activity consumer confidence our production capabilities our employees and our supply chain the cost and availability of materials and the imposition of tariffs our dependence on thirdparty suppliers risks associated with our international operations and global strategies our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy and integrate businesses that we have and may acquire our ability to attract develop and retain talented and diverse personnel risks associated with our reliance on information systems and technology and our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from our investments in new technology these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a risk factors of this report any forwardlooking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it was made factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

executive level overview 

we design manufacture and distribute branded home improvement and building products these products are sold primarily for repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent new home construction we sell our products through home center retailers online retailers wholesalers and distributors mass merchandisers hardware stores direct to the consumer and homebuilders 

2020 results 

net sales were positively impacted by increased sales volume across our two segments such increases were partially offset by unfavorable net selling prices in our decorative architectural products segment 

our plumbing products segment operating profit was positively impacted by cost saving initiatives including actions taken to mitigate the covid19 pandemic impact and higher sales volume these positive impacts were partially offset by increased commodity costs including tariffs and an increase in other expenses such as salaries and legal costs our decorative architectural products segment operating profit benefited primarily from higher sales volume mostly due to paints and other coating products as well as cost savings initiatives including actions taken to mitigate the covid19 pandemic impact additionally operating profit was positively impacted by the nonrecurrence of a 2019 noncash impairment charge related to an other indefinitelived intangible asset for a trademark associated with lighting products these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable net selling prices higher fixed expenses in our lighting business and an increase in other expenses such as salaries legal costs and advertising 

covid19 impact and response 

during 2020 certain aspects of our businesses were adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic many but not all of our businesses remained operating in 2020 because the products we provide are critical to infrastructure sectors and the daytoday operations of homes and businesses in our communities as defined by applicable local orders however some of our facilities experienced reduced capacity due to social distancing requirements andor full closures ranging from a few days to 68 weeks and if certain governmental orders are reimposed or if we are required to close a facility for employee safety reasons we could experience new or extended closures which might adversely impact our ability to produce and distribute our products operational activity that was previously slowed at certain of our facilities as a result of the pandemic and governmental orders largely resumed operations at normal capacities by the third quarter of 2020 enabling them to progress on the fulfillment of production backlogs that developed in the first half of the year as well as to meet current consumer demand finally we may experience supply chain disruptions particularly disruptions related to our ability to source plumbing lighting and builders’ hardware products 

given our portfolio of lower ticket repair and remodeloriented product and the increased demand for repair and remodel spending we experienced strong consumer demand in 2020 these levels of demand may or may not continue and we may experience an adverse impact in our 2021 results due to economic contraction as a result of continued high unemployment levels and remaining or potential renewed shelterinplace and social distancing orders the covid19 pandemic and the mitigating measures taken by many countries have adversely impacted and could in the future materially adversely impact the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

during 2020 we implemented mitigating efforts to manage operating spend and preserve cash and liquidity including the temporary suspension of our share repurchase activity beginning in the second quarter of 2020 which we resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020 currently we have not identified and will continue to monitor for any substantive risk attributable to customer credit and have not experienced a significant impact from permanent store closures or retail bankruptcies 

we continue to be committed to the safety and wellbeing of our employees during this time and led by our crossfunctional infectious illness response team we have employed best practices and followed guidance from the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention we have implemented and are continuing to implement alternative work arrangements to support the health and safety of our employees including working remotely and avoiding large gatherings in addition we have modified work areas and workstations to provide protective measures for employees are staggering shifts requiring the use of face coverings practicing social distancing and increasing the cleaning of our facilities and in the event that we learn of an employee testing positive for covid19 we are completing contact tracing and requiring impacted employees to selfquarantine 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect or could have affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors including the anticipated impact of the covid19 pandemic that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities and related disclosures and future revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

note a to the consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as control of our products is transferred to our customers which is generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with our customers we provide customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives these customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration we include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved this determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale and expected sales volume for ecasts as it relates to our volumebased incentives this determination is updated each reporting period 

we monitor our exposure for credit losses on customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of customers on an ongoing basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances where a risk of loss has been identified and also include a provision for losses based upon historical collection and writeoff activity as well as reasonable and supportable forecast information that considers macroeconomic factors and industryspecific trends associated with our businesses among others a separate allowance is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally based upon sales activity 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits and currently a two percent to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated repair and remodel activity and to a lesser extent estimated housing starts our assumptions included us gross domestic product growing at approximately 42 percent in 2021 and develop into a relatively stable 28 percent each year thereafter and a eurozone gross domestic product growing at approximately 52 percent in 2021 and developing into a relatively stable 22 percent per annum over the fiveyear forecast 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 80 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital in 2020 was consistent with 2019 in 2020 based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 100 percent to 120 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would have resulted in a 6 million impairment to one of our reporting units 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of an other indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying value we utilize a relieffromroyalty model to estimate the fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm we also consider the profitability of the business among other factors to determine the royalty rate for use in the impairment assessment 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 80 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows in 2020 based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses and the nature of the trade name we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 110 percent to 125 percent for our other indefinitelived intangible assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for our other indefinitelived intangible assets were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our other indefinitelived intangible assets would have resulted in a 3 million impairment for one of our trade names 

employee retirement plans 

as of january 1 2010 substantially all our domestic and foreign qualified and domestic nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans were frozen to future benefit accruals 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2019 our board of directors approved the termination of our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans as a result of this decision the projected benefit obligations for these plans were increased to reflect the incremental costs to terminate the plans upon termination in 2021 we expect to recognize from accumulated other comprehensive loss approximately 450 million of pretax actuarial losses and approximately 95 million of income tax benefit which includes approximately 11 million of tax expense from the elimination of a disproportionate tax effect 

in december 2020 our discount rate for obligations decreased to a weighted average of 17 percent from 25 percent the discount rate for obligations is based primarily upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2020 willis towers watson rate link curve for our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans the projected benefit obligations include the estimated incremental cost related to the termination for these plans the discount rate was then set equal to the discount rate that results in the same projected benefit obligation resulting from the normal projected benefit obligation calculation plus the estimated incremental cost to terminate the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 07 percent to 21 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 16 percent or higher due to the anticipated termination of our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans and the related plan assets comprised mostly of fixed income and cash the assumed asset return for these assets was 20 percent 

the net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 255 million at december 31 2020 from 254 million at december 31 2019 our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans increased to 162 million at december 31 2020 from 161 million at december 31 2019 these unfunded plans are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 113 percent to 117 percent 

the increase in our qualified definedbenefit pension plan projected benefit obligation was primarily impacted by a decrease in the discount rate during 2020 we contributed 57 million to our qualified definedbenefit pension plans and our qualified definedbenefit pension plan assets had a positive return of 97 percent refer to note n to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 470 million in 2021 compared with 30 million in 2020  the expected increase in pension expense is due to the anticipated termination of our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans and the recognition of losses currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was 50 basis points lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2021 pension expense would increase by 60 million  assuming a 0 percent asset return for our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans projected 2021 total qualified definedbenefit pension plan expenses are expected to be approximately 474 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 6 million in 2021 compared to 8 million recognized in 2020 

consistent with our plan to terminate the qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans we currently anticipate contributing approximately 140 million in 2021 refer to note n to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the funding of our plans 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

we maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2020 should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

corporate development strategy 

we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing businesses and as appropriate complementing our existing business with strategic acquisitions during 2020 we completed the acquisitions of kraus work tools and smartap and signed an agreement to acquire majority interest in ess 

in addition we actively manage our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that do not align with our longterm growth strategy we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses if any may not align with our longterm growth strategy 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations the issuance of notes in the financial markets bank borrowings and the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies our capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in our business balancing share repurchases with potential acquisitions and maintaining an appropriate dividend 

we had cash and cash investments of approximately 13 billion at december 31 2020 our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts time deposit accounts and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

of the 13 billion and 697 million of cash and cash investments we held at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 385 million and 297 million respectively was held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us would not result in significant additional us income tax or foreign withholding tax as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted 

our current ratio was 18 to 1 at both december 31 2020 and 2019 

our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 87 percent and 102 percent at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively refer to note l to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

senior indebtedness 

on september 18 2020 we issued 300 million of 20 notes due october 1 2030 the 2030 notes and received proceeds of 300 million net of discount for the issuance of the 2030 notes also on september 18 2020 we issued an incremental 100 million on our existing 45 notes due may 15 2047 the 2047 notes and received proceeds of 119 million including a premium for the issuance of the 2047 notes the incremental 100 million formed a single series with the existing 300 million of 45 notes due may 15 2047 the 2030 notes and 2047 notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price on september 29 2020 proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay and early retire 400 million of our 35 notes due april 1 2021 in connection with this early retirement we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of 6 million which was recorded as interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations

share repurchases 

in september 2019 our board of directors authorized the repurchase for retirement of up to 20 billion of shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise 

during 2020 we repurchased and retired 188 million shares of our common stock including 04 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of restricted stock units granted during the year for approximately 727 million at december 31 2020 we had 774 million remaining under the 2019 authorization our board of directors authorized the repurchase for retirement of up to 20 billion shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise effective february 10 2021 replacing the 2019 authorization 

during 2019 we repurchased and retired 201 million shares of our common stock including 06 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2019 for approximately 896 million 

during 2018 we repurchased and retired 186 million shares of our common stock including 07 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2018 for approximately 654 million 

consistent with past practice and as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value we anticipate using approximately 800 million of cash for share repurchases including shares which will be purchased to offset any dilution from restricted stock units granted as part of our compensation programs in 2021 

dividend to holder of common shares 

in the third quarter of 2020 we increased our quarterly dividend to 014 per common share from 0135 per common share 

as part of our capital allocation strategy and subject to declaration by our board of directors we intend to increase the annual dividend to 094 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2021 

other liquidity and capital resource activities 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity we work with suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions including extending payment terms we also facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program the program to provide certain of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions a third party administers the program our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution we do not enter into agreements with any of the participating financial institutions in connection with the program the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program 

all outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets the amounts owed to participating financial institutions under the program and included in accounts payable for our continuing operations were 45 million and 29 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we account for all payments made under the program as a reduction to our cash flows from operations and reported within our increase decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities net line within our consolidated statements of cash flows the amounts settled through the program and paid to participating financial institutions were 146 million 164 million and 117 million for our continuing operations during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively a downgrade in our credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions’ willingness to commit funds to and participate in the program we do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows as substantially all of our payments are made outside of the program 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro british pound the chinese renminbi and the us dollar occasionally we have also used derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis we currently do not have any derivative instruments for which we have designated hedge accounting 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



our working capital days were as follows 



net cash provided by operations of 953 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization expense of 133 million and stockbased compensation expense as well as changes in working capital amounts and employee withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation which is classified as a financing activity these amounts were partially offset by the net gain on the sale of cabinetry as well as contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans 

net cash used for financing activities was 886 million primarily due to 727 million for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value 400 million for the early retirement of our 35 notes due april 1 2021 145 million for the payment of cash dividends 25 million for employee withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation and 23 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interests these uses of cash were partially offset by the issuances of 300 million of 20 notes due october 1 2030 and an incremental 100 million on our existing 45 notes due may 15 2047 that was issued at a premium of 19 million and 26 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

net cash provided by investing activities was 531 million primarily driven by 870 million of proceeds from the sale of cabinetry net of cash disposed these proceeds were partially offset by 175 million for the 2020 acquisitions net of cash acquired 114 million for capital expenditures and the 52 million advance payment for the acquisition of ess that closed on january 4 2021 

we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations of those businesses that align with our longterm growth strategy to increase our productivity improve customer service and support product innovation capital expenditures for 2020 were 114 million compared with 162 million for 2019 and 219 million for 2018 for 2021 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2021 acquisitions are expected to be approximately 150 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2020 totaled 133 million compared with 159 million for 2019 and 156 million for 2018 for 2021 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2021 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 155 million amortization expense totaled 28 million in 2020 compared with 27 million and 24 million in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities however due to the highly uncertain nature severity and duration or resurgence of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on our customer suppliers and employees we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact it may have on our future financial condition 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results under gaap 

the following discussion of consolidated results of operations compares 2020 and 2019 descriptions of changes between 2019 and 2018 were excluded as there were no changes from what was disclosed in the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of the december 31 2019 form 10k 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2020 were 72 billion which increased seven percent compared to 2019 excluding the effect of currency translation net sales increased seven percent the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding the effect of currency translation in millions 



net sales for 2020 increased seven percent primarily due to higher sales volume of our paints and other coating products plumbing products and to a lesser extent builders hardware which in aggregate increased sales by eight percent this increase was slightly offset by unfavorable net selling prices of paints and other coating products which decreased sales by one percent 

our gross profit margins were 360 percent 354 percent and 350 percent in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the 2020 gross profit margin was positively impacted by increased sales volume and cost savings initiatives including actions taken to mitigate the covid19 pandemic impact such increases were slightly offset by unfavorable net selling prices and increased commodity costs partially attributed to tariffs 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 180 percent in 2020 compared with 190 percent in 2019 and 188 percent in 2018 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2020 was primarily driven by cost containment activities including those actions taken to mitigate the covid19 pandemic impact and leverage of fixed expenses due primarily to increased sales volume this improvement was partially offset by an increase in other expenses such as salaries legal costs and advertising 

the following table reconciles reported operating profit to operating profit as adjusted to exclude certain items dollars in millions 



operating profit in 2020 was positively affected by increased sales volume and cost savings initiatives including actions taken to mitigate the covid19 pandemic impact these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable net selling prices increased commodity costs partially attributed to tariffs higher fixed expenses in our lighting business and an increase in other expenses such as salaries legal cost and advertising 

other income expense net 

interest expense was 144 million 159 million and 156 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

income taxes 

our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 24 percent 25 percent and 24 percent in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as a result of irs guidance issued in the third quarter of 2020 that allows us to retroactively exclude certain hightaxed foreign income from the us tax effects on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti back to 2018 we lowered our normalized tax rate from 26 percent to 25 percent for 2020 2019 and 2018 

our effective tax rate in 2020 was lower than our normalized tax rate of 25 percent due primarily to a 5 million income tax benefit from a change in judgment regarding the realizability of certain deferred tax assets in our foreign jurisdictions an additional 4 million tax benefit from stockbased compensation payments and a 6 million tax benefit due to an anticipated refund claim from the retroactive application of the exclusion of certain hightaxed foreign income from the us tax effects on gilti back to 2018 

our effective tax rate in 2018 was lower than our normalized tax rate of 25 percent due primarily to an additional 14 million tax benefit from stockbased compensation payments partially offset by a 6 million tax expense recognized on gilti prior to the retroactive exclusion of certain hightaxed foreign income as allowed under the recently issued irs guidance in 2020

our business segments 

we report our financial results from continuing operations in two segments our plumbing products segment and our decorative architectural products segment which are aggregated by product similarity our decorative architectural products segment is impacted by seasonality and normally experiences stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for repair and remodel activity 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us 



 we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe competitors of the majority of our products in this segment include fortune brands home  security incs moen rohl and riobel brands kohler co lixil group corporation’s american standard and grohe brands and spectrum brands holdings inc’s pfister faucets competitors of our spas and exercise pools and systems include artesian spas jacuzzi and master spas brands foreign manufacturers competing with us are located primarily in europe and china we face significant competition from private label products many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting pressure on price the businesses in our plumbing products segment manufacture products in north america europe and asia and source products from asia and other regions competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation product features and innovation product quality customer service breadth of product offering and price 

many of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have multiple sources both domestic and foreign for the raw materials used in this segment and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc to help reduce the impact of this volatility from time to time we may enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers or occasionally use derivative instruments in addition some of the products in this segment that we import have been and may in the future be subject to duties and tariffs

titanium dioxide and acrylic resins are principal raw materials in the manufacture of architectural coatings the price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of global supply and demand dynamics and production capacity limitations which can have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment the price of acrylic resins fluctuates based on the price of its components which can also have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment in addition the prices of crude oil natural gas and certain petroleum byproducts can impact our costs and results of operations in this segment we have agreements with certain significant suppliers for this segment that are intended to help assure continued supply

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity both of which are impacted by a number of economic factors and the housing market 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity a number of factors impact consumers’ spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity including 

 the fundamentals driving our business are impacted by economic cycles adverse changes or uncertainty involving the factors listed above or an economic downturn in the united states or worldwide could result in a decline in spending on residential repair and remodeling activity and a decline in demand for new home construction which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we could lose market share if we do not maintain our strong brands develop innovative products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences or if our reputation is damaged 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products our initiatives to invest in brand building brand awareness and product innovation may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing innovative and improved products such as gauging changing consumer demands and preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if the products we introduce do not gain widespread acceptance or if our competitors improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do we could lose market share or be required to reduce our prices which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

in recent years consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers’ business models and strategies have changed as our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure including maintaining robust and userfriendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and providing comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development if we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers or if our customers are unable to successfully execute their strategies our brands may lose market share 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to changing consumer preferences including a shift in consumer purchasing practices toward ecommerce our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our public image and reputation are important to maintaining our strong brands and could be adversely affected by various factors including product quality and service claims and comments in social media or the press or negative publicity regarding disputes or legal action against us even if unfounded damage to our public image or reputation could adversely affect our sales and results of operations and financial position 

we face significant competition and operate in an evolving competitive landscape 

our products face significant competition we believe that brand reputation is an important factor affecting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features innovation quality customer service warranty and price we sell many of our products through home center retailers online retailers distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers our success with our customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery in addition home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly selling directly to professional contractors and installers which may adversely affect our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

certain of our customers are increasingly selling products sourced from low ‑ cost foreign manufacturers under their own private label brands which directly compete with our brands as this trend continues we may experience lower demand for our products or a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more value ‑ priced or opening price point products which may affect our profitability 

in addition we face competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace including sales promotion programs that could affect our market share or result in price reductions which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

further the growing e ‑ commerce channel brings an increased number of competitors and greater pricing transparency for consumers as well as conflicts between our existing distribution channels and a need for different distribution methods these factors could affect our results of operations and financial position in addition our relationships with our customers including our home center customers may be affected if we increase the amount of business we transact in the ecommerce channel 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers 

as a result of the divestiture of our windows business in 2019 and the expected divestiture of our cabinetry business the mix of our business operations has changed and the concentration of our sales to our two largest customers has increased and may continue to increase in 2019  our net sales from our continuing operations to the home depot were 25 billion approximately 37 percent of our consolidated net sales and our net sales from our continuing operations to lowe’s were less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales these home center retailers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them additionally these home center retailers may reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us although other retailers dealers distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services we might not be able to quickly replace if at all the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to lowe’s and any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition these home center retailers are granted product exclusivity from time to time which affects our ability to sell products to other customers and increases the complexity of our product offerings and our costs 

variability in the cost of our raw materials component parts and finished goods including the imposition of tariffs could affect our results of operations and financial position 

we purchase substantial amounts of raw materials component parts and finished goods from outside sources including international sources and we manufacture certain of our products outside of the united states increases in the cost of the materials we purchase have in the past and may in the future increase the prices for our products including as a result of new significant tariffs for example the recent trade dispute between the united states and china has resulted in increased tariffs which raised the cost of certain of our materials there is a risk that additional tariffs on imports from china or new tariffs could be imposed which could further increase the cost of the materials we purchase or import or the products we manufacture internationally further our production could be affected if we or our suppliers are unable to procure our requirements for various commodities including among others brass resins titanium dioxide and zinc or if a shortage of these commodities results in significantly increased costs rising energy costs could also increase our production and transportation costs  in addition water is a significant component of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

it can be difficult for us to pass on to customers our cost increases our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to sufficiently increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased material and production costs including the impact of increasing tariffs our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected increased selling prices for our products have and may in the future lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if those prices are not competitive when our material costs decline we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices such reductions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

from time to time we enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of the commodities we require to produce our products and to establish firm pricing but at times these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract occasionally we may also use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which has occurred and could occur in the future and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers 

we are dependent on third ‑ party suppliers for many of our products and components and our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate and timely supply of these products and components failure of our suppliers to timely provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or our policies regarding our supplier business practices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position or could damage our reputation sourcing these products and components from alternate suppliers including suppliers from new geographic regions is timeconsuming and costly and could result in inefficiencies or delays in our business operations accordingly the loss of critical suppliers or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

many of the suppliers we rely upon are located in foreign countries the differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements changes in economic conditions and trade policies and laws and regulations together with the limited number of suppliers have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain or if there is a disruption in transporting the products or components our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

there are risks associated with our international operations and global strategies 

in 2019 21 percent of our sales from continuing operations were made outside of north america principally in europe and transacted in currencies other than the us dollar in addition to our european operations we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties globally risks associated with our international operations include changes in political monetary and social environments economic conditions labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments social and political unrest terrorist attacks cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 

we are also affected by domestic and international laws applicable to companies doing business abroad or importing and exporting goods and materials these include tax laws laws regulating competition anti‑briberyanti‑corruption and other business practices and trade regulations including duties and tariffs compliance with these laws is costly and future changes to these laws may require significant management attention and disrupt our operations additionally while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure significant changes in how us and foreign jurisdictions tax cross‑border transactions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our results of operations and financial position are also impacted by changes in currency exchange rates unfavorable currency exchange rates particularly the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar and the chinese yuan renminbi have in the past adversely affected us and could adversely affect us in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

additionally as the situation involving the united kingdom’s decision to exit from the european union continues to develop we could experience volatility in the currency exchange rates or a change in the demand for our products and services particularly in our uk and european markets or there could be disruption of our operations and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives of investing in our brands developing innovative products and focusing on operational excellence through the masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity these initiatives are designed to grow revenue improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid ‑ to long ‑ term our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization 

we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy or integrate businesses that we acquire 

pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions within a desired time frame or at acceptable terms and prices our long ‑ term competitive positioning may be affected even if we are successful in acquiring businesses the businesses we acquire may not be able to achieve the revenue profitability or growth we anticipate or we may experience challenges and risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business such risks include 

 future foreign acquisitions may also increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must invest significant resources to attract develop and retain highly qualified  talented and diverse employees at all levels who have the experience knowledge and expertise to implement our strategic initiatives we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we may fail in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them particularly with low unemployment levels in the united states from time to time we have been affected by a shortage of qualified personnel in certain geographic areas our growth competitive position and results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected by our failure to attract develop and retain key employees to build strong leadership teams or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess or by a shortage of qualified employees 

we rely on information systems and technology and a breakdown of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we rely on many information systems and technology to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities we may be adversely affected if our information systems breakdown fail or are no longer supported in addition to the consequences that may occur from interruptions in our systems increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems 

we have implemented security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations despite these efforts our systems have been and may in the future be damaged disrupted or shut down due to cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized access malware ransomware undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions have led and could in the future lead to business interruption production or operational downtime product shipment delays exposure or loss of proprietary confidential personal or financial information data corruption an inability to report our financial results in a timely manner damage to the reputation of our brands damage to our relationships with our customers and suppliers exposure to litigation and increased costs associated with the remediation and mitigation of such attacks such events could adversely affect our results of operations and 

financial position in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation 

we may not experience the anticipated benefits from our investments in new technology 

we continue to invest in new technology systems throughout our company including implementations of enterprise resource planning “erp” systems at our business units erp implementations are complex and require significant management oversight and we have experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated expenses and interruptions to our operations during these implementations our results of operations and financial position as well as the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected if we do not appropriately select and implement our new technology systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation of erp systems 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are involved in various claims and litigation including class actions mass torts and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have a material adverse effect on us the types of matters may include among others competition product liability employment warranty advertising contract personal injury  environmental intellectual property product compliance and insurance coverage the outcome and effect of these matters are inherently unpredictable and defending and resolving them can be costly and can divert management’s attention we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of claims and litigation 

we are also subject to product safety regulations product recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant costs and regardless of the ultimate outcome create adverse publicity and damage the reputation of our brands and business also we rely on other manufacturers to provide products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products and components we source from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of the risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover our losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

refer to note t to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

compliance with laws government regulation and industry standards is costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to 

 in addition to complying with current requirements and known future requirements even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future 

as we sell new types of products or existing products in new geographic areas or channels or for new applications we are subject to the requirements applicable to those sales additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with new or changed laws regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs our manufacturing processes our packaging or our sourcing these compliance activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property has been and may again be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us current and former employees contractors customers or suppliers have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by them or disclosed to others including our competitors protecting and defending our intellectual property could be costly time consuming and require significant resources if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility 

we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement and in order to borrow under it we cannot be in default with any of those provisions our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be affected if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants in the past we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement our financial flexibility could be restricted

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as outlook believe anticipate appear may will should intend plan estimate expect assume seek forecast and similar references to future periods our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements 

in addition to the various factors included in the executive level overview critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections our future performance may be affected by the levels of residential repair and remodel activity and new home construction our ability to maintain our strong brands and reputation and to develop innovative products our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries our reliance on key customers the cost and availability of materials and the imposition of tariffs our dependence on thirdparty suppliers risks associated with our international operations and global strategies our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives including the pending divestiture of our masco cabinetry business our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy and integrate businesses that we have and may acquire our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel risks associated with our reliance on information systems and technology and our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from our investments in new technology these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a risk factors of this report any forwardlooking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it was made factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

executive level overview 

we design manufacture and distribute branded home improvement and building products these products are sold primarily for repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent new home construction we sell our products through home center retailers online retailers mass merchandisers hardware stores homebuilders distributors and direct to the consumer 

2019 results 

net sales were positively impacted by increased net selling prices across our two segments and the acquisition of the ld kichler co kichler in march 2018 such increases were partially offset by a decrease in volume primarily in our decorative architectural products segment and unfavorable foreign currency translation 

our plumbing products segment was negatively impacted by an increase in other expenses such as salaries marketing spend and severance charges an increase in commodity costs unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher depreciation expense these negative impacts were partially offset by increased net selling prices and the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives our decorative architectural products segment was positively impacted by increased net selling prices across the segment the absence of the recognition of the inventory stepup adjustment established as part of the 2018 kichler acquisition and the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives these positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in commodity costs and lower sales volume across the segment an increase in strategic growth investments and a noncash impairment charge related to an other indefinitelived intangible asset for a trademark associated with lighting products 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

note a to the consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as control of our products is transferred to our customers which is generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with our customers we provide customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives these customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration we include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved this determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale and expected sales volume for ecasts as it relates to our volumebased incentives this determination is updated each reporting period 

we monitor our exposure for credit losses on customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances where a risk of default has been identified and also include a provision for noncustomer specific defaults based upon historical collection return and writeoff activity a separate allowance is recorded for customer incentive rebates and is generally based upon sales activity 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we primarily complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants for our masco cabinetry reporting unit we utilized a market approach to determine its fair value instead of the discounted cash flow method as we were actively marketing the masco cabinetry business for sale and on november 14 2019 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits and currently a two to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated repair and remodel activity and estimated housing starts our assumptions included a relatively stable us gross domestic product growing at approximately 19 percent per annum and a eurozone gross domestic product growing at approximately 10 percent per annum over the fiveyear forecast 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 80 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2019 as compared to 2018  primarily due to declining interest rates and lower longterm market growth outlooks in 2019  based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 100 percent to 120 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

in the fourth quarter of 2019  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would have resulted in a 35 million impairment to one of our reporting units 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of an other indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying value we utilize a relieffromroyalty model to estimate the fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm we also consider the profitability of the business among other factors to determine the royalty rate for use in the impairment assessment 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 80 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows in 2019  based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 110 percent to 130 percent for our other indefinitelived intangible assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2019  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for our other indefinitelived intangible assets were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our other indefinitelived intangible assets would have resulted in a 3 million impairment for one of our trade names 

employee retirement plans 

as of january 1 2010 substantially all our domestic and foreign qualified and domestic nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans were frozen to future benefit accruals 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2019 our board of directors approved the termination of our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans as a result of this decision the projected benefit obligations for these plans were increased to reflect the incremental costs to terminate the plans upon termination in 2021 we expect to recognize from accumulated other comprehensive loss approximately 420 million of pretax actuarial losses and approximately 90 million of income tax benefit which includes approximately 11 million of tax expense from the elimination of a disproportionate tax effect 

in december 2019  our discount rate for obligations decreased to a weighted average of 25 percent from 38 percent the discount rate for obligations is based primarily upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2019 willis towers watson rate link curve for our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans the projected benefit obligations include the estimated incremental cost related to the termination for these plans the discount rate was then set equal to the discount rate that results in the same projected benefit obligation resulting from the normal projected benefit obligation calculation plus the estimated incremental cost to terminate the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 11 percent to 30 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 24 percent or 

higher the assumed asset return was primarily 30 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets based upon an analysis of expected and historical rates of return of various asset classes utilizing the current and longterm target asset allocation of the plan assets 

the net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 254 million at december 31 2019 from 226 million at december 31 2018  our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans increased to 161 million at december 31 2019 from 155 million at december 31 2018  these unfunded plans are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 90 percent to 119 percent 

the increase in our qualified definedbenefit pension plan projected benefit obligation was primarily impacted by a decrease in the discount rate during 2019  we contributed 56 million to our qualified definedbenefit pension plans and our qualified definedbenefit pension plan assets had a positive return of 177 percent refer to note m to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 30 million in 2020 compared with 16 million in 2019  if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was 50 basis points lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2020 pension expense would increase by 5 million  assuming a 0 percent asset return for our qualified domestic definedbenefit pension plans projected 2020 total qualified definedbenefit pension plan expenses are expected to be approximately 37 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 8 million in 2020  consistent with the pension expense recognized in 2019 

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 23 million in 2020 to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans however we currently anticipate contributing approximately 64 million in 2020  refer to note m to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the funding of our plans 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial 

statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the future realization of deferred tax 

assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income 

include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

we maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2019  should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the comprehensive us tax reform which generally became effective in 2018 has had a significant impact on our effective tax rate and taxes paid primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the additional us taxes on our foreign earnings the continued impact from us tax reform may differ from our current estimates due to the issuance and finalization of future regulatory guidance 

corporate development strategy 

we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing businesses and as appropriate complementing our existing business with strategic acquisitions in addition we actively manage our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that do not align with our longterm growth strategy 

during 2019 we completed the divestitures of our ukwg and milgard businesses and entered into a definitive agreement to sell our masco cabinetry business we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses if any may not align with our longterm growth strategy 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations the issuance of notes in the financial markets bank borrowings and the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies our capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in our business balancing share repurchases with potential acquisitions and maintaining an appropriate dividend 

our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 102 percent and 98 percent at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively refer to note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during 2019 we completed the divestitures of our ukwg and milgard businesses and entered into a definitive agreement to sell our masco cabinetry business with the combined proceeds of 722 million for the ukwg and milgard divestitures we executed an accelerated stock repurchase agreement to repurchase 400 million of our common stock this repurchase is under mascos existing share repurchase authorization of 20 billion of shares of our common stock which was approved in september 2019 during 2019 including the accelerated stock repurchase agreement we repurchased 201 million shares of our common stock for cash aggregating 896 million  

additionally we redeemed and retired 201 million of our 7125 notes due march 15 2020 on december 19 2019 in connection with this early retirement we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of 2 million which was recorded as interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

in the third quarter of 2019 we increased our quarterly dividend to 135 per common share from 12 per common share 

on march 13 2019 we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with an aggregate commitment of 10 billion and a maturity date of march 13 2024 under the credit agreement at our request and subject to certain conditions we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional 500 million with the current lenders or new lenders upon entry into the credit agreement our credit agreement dated march 28 2013 as amended with an aggregate commitment of 750 million was terminated see note k to the consolidated financial statements 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a a net leverage ratio as adjusted for certain items not exceeding 40 to 10 and b a minimum interest coverage ratio as adjusted for certain items not less than 25 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants and no borrowings were outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2019 

on march 9 2018 we acquired substantially all of the net assets of kichler the purchase price net of 2 million cash acquired consisted of 549 million paid with cash on hand 

on april 16 2018 we repaid and retired all of our 114 million  6625 notes on the scheduled repayment date 

on june 21 2017 we issued 300 million of 35 notes due november 15 2027 and 300 million of 45 notes due may 15 2047 we received proceeds of 599 million net of discount for the issuance of these notes the notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price on june 27 2017 proceeds from the debt issuances together with cash on hand were used to repay and early retire 299 million of our 7125 notes due march 15 2020 74 million of our 595 notes due march 15 2022 62 million of our 775 notes due august 1 2029 and 100 million of our 65 notes due august 15 2032 in connection with these early retirements we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of 107 million  which was recorded as interest expense 

as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity we work with suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions including extending payment terms we also facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program the program to provide certain of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions a third party administers the program our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution we do not enter into agreements with any of the participating financial institutions in connection with the program the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program 

all outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets the amounts owed to participating financial institutions under the program and included in accounts payable for our continuing operations were 29 million and 35 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we account for all payments made under the program as a reduction to our cash flows from operations and reported within our decrease increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities net line within our consolidated statements of cash flows the amounts settled through the program and paid to participating financial institutions were 164 million 117 million and 186 million for our continuing operations during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively a downgrade in our credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions’ willingness to commit funds to and participate in the program we do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows as substantially all of our payments are made outside of the program 

we had cash and cash investments of approximately 697 million at december 31 2019  our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts time deposit accounts and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

of the 697 million and 552 million of cash and cash investments we held at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 297 million and 270 million respectively was held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us would not result in significant additional us income tax or foreign withholding tax as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro british pound and the us dollar occasionally we have also used derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis we currently do not have any derivative instruments for which we have designated hedge accounting 

our current ratio was 18 to 1 and 16 to 1 at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the increase in our current ratio is due primarily to the cash received from the divestiture of our milgard business less cash used for the accelerated stock repurchase agreement and to repay and retire our 7125 notes due march 15 2020 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



our working capital days were as follows 



net cash provided by operations of 833 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization expense of 159 million  stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays as well as employee withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation which is classified as a financing activity these amounts were partially offset by the net gain on the sale of milgard and ukwg as well as contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans 

net cash used for financing activities was 1291 million  primarily due to 896 million for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value 201 million for the early retirement of our 7125 notes due march 15 2020 144 million for the payment of cash dividends 42 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interests and 23 million for employee withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation these uses of cash were slightly offset by 27 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

in september 2019 our board of directors authorized the repurchase for retirement of up to 20 billion of shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise replacing the previous authorization established by our board of directors in 2017 during 2019 we repurchased and retired 201 million shares of our common stock including 06 million shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2019 at december 31 2019 we had 15 billion remaining under the authorization consistent with past practice and as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value we anticipate using approximately 12 billion of cash for share repurchases including shares which will be purchased to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted as part of our compensation programs in 2020 

net cash provided by investing activities was 582 million  primarily driven by 720 million of proceeds from the sale of milgard net of cash disposed partially offset by 162 million for capital expenditures 

we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support product innovation capital expenditures for 2019 were 162 million  compared with 219 million for 2018 and 173 million for 2017  for 2020  capital expenditures of our continuing operations excluding any potential acquisitions are expected to be approximately 150 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2019 totaled 159 million  compared with 156 million for 2018 and 127 million for 2017  for 2020  depreciation and amortization expense of our continuing operations excluding any potential 2020 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 140 million amortization expense totaled 27 million in 2019  compared with 24 million and 11 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations and our ability to utilize our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results under gaap 

the following discussion of consolidated results of operations compares each respective period to the same period of the immediately preceding year 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2019 were 67 billion  which increased one percent compared to 2018  excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation net sales increased one percent the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 



net sales for 2019 increased one percent primarily due to increased net selling prices of our plumbing products and paints and other coating products which in aggregate increased sales by two percent the acquisition of kichler in march 2018 increased sales by one percent net sales for 2019 were negatively impacted by decreased sales volume of our lighting products which decreased sales by one percent foreign currency translation also decreased sales by one percent 

net sales for 2018 increased 11 percent primarily due to the acquisition of kichler in march 2018 and mercury plastics inc mercury in december 2017 which increased sales by six percent net sales were also positively impacted by increased sales volume of plumbing products which increased sales by three percent and net selling price increases of paints and other coating products and plumbing products which in aggregate increased sales by two percent foreign currency translation also increased sales by one percent net sales for 2018 were negatively affected by the divestiture of our arrow fastener co llc arrow and moores furniture group limited moores businesses which in aggregate decreased sales by one percent 

our gross profit margins were 354 percent 350 percent and 369 percent in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the 2019 gross profit margin was positively impacted by increased net selling prices and the absence of the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as part of the acquisition of kichler such increases were partially offset by an increase in commodity costs including tariffs the 2018 gross profit margin was negatively impacted by an increase in commodity costs the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as a part of the acquisition of kichler an increase in other expenses such as salaries and logistics costs and unfavorable sales mix these negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in net selling prices increased sales volume and the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 190 percent in 2019 compared with 188 percent in 2018 and 198 percent in 2017  the increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in marketing spend the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2018 was driven by leverage of fixed expenses due primarily to increased sales volume and improved cost control 

the following table reconciles reported operating profit to operating profit as adjusted to exclude certain items dollars in millions 



operating profit in 2019 was positively affected by increased net selling prices the absence of the recognition of the kichler inventory step up adjustment and benefits associated with cost savings initiatives these positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in commodity costs including tariffs and an increase in other expenses such as salaries operating profit in 2018 was positively affected by increased net selling prices increased sales volume and benefits associated with cost savings initiatives these positive impacts were partially offset by an increase in commodity costs the recognition of the kichler inventory step up adjustment and an increase in other expenses such as salaries logistics costs and erp costs 

other income expense net 

other net for 2019 included 21 million of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost partially offset by 2 million of realized foreign currency transaction gains and 1 million of earnings related to equity method investments 

other net for 2018 included 14 million of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost and 8 million of realized foreign currency transaction losses these expenses were partially offset by 3 million of earnings related to equity method investments and 1 million related related to distributions from private equity funds 

interest expense was 159 million  156 million and 279 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the decrease in interest expense from 2017 to 2018 is primarily the result of a loss on debt extinguishment of 107 million which was recorded as additional interest expense in connection with the early retirement of debt in 2017 the discharge of indebtedness in 2018 and refinancing certain debt at more favorable interest rates in 2017 

income and income per common share from continuing operations attributable to masco corporation 

income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2019 were 639 million and 220 per common share respectively income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2018 were 636 million and 205 per common share respectively income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2017 were 426 million and 133 per common share respectively 

our effective tax rate was 25 percent 24 percent and 34 percent in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively us tax reform which generally became effective in 2018 reduced the us federal tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent additionally effective january 1 2017 we adopted asu 201609 which requires the tax effects related to employee stockbased payments to be recorded to income tax expense thus increasing the volatility in our effective tax rate our normalized tax rate was 26 percent for both 2019 and 2018 and 34 percent for 2017  

our effective tax rate in 2019 and 2018 was lower than our normalized of 26 percent due primarily to a 3 million income tax benefit from a change in judgment regarding the realizability of certain deferred tax assets in our state and foreign jurisdictions recognized in 2019 and a 4 million and 14 million tax benefit from stockbased compensation payments recognized in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by divestiture of businesses with no tax impact this impact was offset by a 17 million net tax benefit from the impact of changes in us federal tax law and a 18 million tax benefit from stockbased compensation payments recognized in 2017  

refer to note r to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we have considered the provisions of accounting guidance regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments 

we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes between the us dollar and the european euro british pound and canadian dollar and to market price fluctuations related to our financial investments we have insignificant involvement with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 

at december 31 2019  we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates a 10 percent decline in the market value of our longterm investments or a 100 basis point change in interest rates based upon the analyses performed such changes would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 

business 

tableend masco corporation is a global leader in the design manufacture and distribution of branded home improvement and building products our portfolio of industryleading brands includes behr® paint delta® and hansgrohe® faucets and bath and shower fixtures kraftmaid® and merillat® cabinets milgard® windows and doors kichler® decorative and outdoor lighting and hot spring® spas we leverage our powerful brands across product categories sales channels and geographies to create value for our customers and shareholders 

we believe that our solid results of operations and financial position for 2018  resulted from our continued focus on our three strategic pillars driving the full potential of our core businesses leveraging opportunities across our businesses and actively managing our portfolio 

 

 

 

we believe that the actions we have taken over the last few years combined with the masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity have positioned us to further enhance shareholder value we will continue to focus on our disciplined execution of our strategy in 2019 

masco was incorporated under the laws of michigan in 1929 and was reincorporated under the laws of delaware in 1968 

our business segments 

we report our financial results in four segments aggregated by similarity in products all of our segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for repair and remodel activity and new home construction 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe competitors of the majority of our products in this segment include lixil group corporation’s american standard brands and grohe products kohler co fortune brands home  security incs moen rohl and riobel brands and spectrum brands holdings llc’s pfister faucets competitors of our spas and exercise pools and systems include artesian jacuzzi and master spas brands foreign manufacturers competing with us are located primarily in germany and china we face significant competition from private label products many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price the businesses in our plumbing products segment manufacture products in north america europe and asia and source products from asia and other regions competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation product features and innovation product quality customer service breadth of product offering and price 

many of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have multiple sources both domestic and foreign for the raw materials used in this segment and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc to help reduce the impact of this volatility from time to time we may enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers or occasionally use derivative instruments in addition some of the products in this segment that we import may be subject to duties and tariffs 

decorative architectural products 

we produce architectural coatings including paints primers specialty coatings stains and waterproofing products these products are sold in north america south america and china under the brand names behr ®  kilz ®  and other trademarks to “do‑it‑yourself” and professional customers through home center retailers and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 24 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2018  and   25 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017  and 2016  our behr products are sold through the home depot our largest customer overall as well as this segment’s largest customer the loss of this segment’s sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

our competitors in this segment include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore  co ppg industries inc with its glidden olympic ppg and pittsburgh paint brands the sherwin‑williams company with its sherwinwilliams and valspar brands as well as thompson’s water seal and minwax brands a nd rpm international inc with its rustoleum and zinsser brands as well as many regional and other national brands we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection and that competition in this industry is also based largely on product features and innovation product quality customer service and price 

titanium dioxide and acrylic resins are major raw materials in the manufacture of architectural coatings the price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of global supply and demand dynamics and production capacity limitations which can have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment the price of acrylic resins fluctuates based on the price of its components which can also have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment in addition the prices of crude oil natural gas and certain petroleum byproducts can 

also impact our costs and results of operations in this segment we have agreements with certain significant suppliers for this segment that are intended to help assure continued supply

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity both of which are cyclical 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity a number of factors affect consumers’ spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity including 

 

the fundamentals driving our business are cyclical fluctuating with economic cycles adverse changes or uncertainty involving the factors listed above or an economic downturn in the united states or worldwide could result in a decline in spending on residential repair and remodeling activity and a decline in demand for new home construction which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we could lose market share if we do not maintain our strong brands develop new products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences or if our reputation is damaged 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products while we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness these initiatives may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if we do not introduce new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance we could lose market share which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position it is also possible that our competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do which could adversely affect our market share 

in recent years consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers’ business models and strategies have changed as our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure including maintaining robust and userfriendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and providing comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development if we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers or if our customers are unable to successfully execute their strategies our brands may lose market share 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to changing consumer purchasing practices including an increase in ecommerce and consumer preferences our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our public image and reputation are important to maintaining our strong brands and could be adversely affected by various factors including product quality and service claims and comments in social media or the press or negative publicity regarding disputes or legal action against us even if unfounded damage to our public image or reputation could adversely affect our sales and results of operations and financial position 

we face significant competition and operate in an evolving competitive landscape 

our products face significant competition we believe that brand reputation is an important factor affecting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features and innovation product quality customer service warranty and price we sell many of our products through home center retailers online retailers distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers our success with our customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery in addition home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly selling directly to professional contractors and installers which may adversely affect our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

we also compete with low ‑ cost foreign manufacturers and private label brands sold by our customers in a variety of our product groups as market dynamics change we may experience a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more value ‑ priced or opening price point products which may affect our profitability 

further as the e ‑ commerce channel expands greater pricing transparency for consumers continuing conflicts between our existing distribution channels and a need for different distribution methods could affect our results of operations and financial position in addition our relationships with our customers including our home center customers may be affected if we increase the amount of business we transact in the ecommerce channel 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries   our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers 

our sales are concentrated with our two largest customers in 2018  our net sales to the home depot were 27 billion approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net sales and our net sales to lowe’s were less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales our reliance on these significant customers may further increase if the mix of our business operations changes including as a result of acquisitions or divestitures these home center retailers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them additionally these home center retailers may reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us although other retailers dealers distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services we might not be able to quickly replace if at all the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to lowe’s and any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

in addition these home center retailers are granted product exclusivity from time to time which affects our ability to sell products to other customers and increases the complexity of our product offerings and our costs 

variability in commodity costs limited availability of commodities and increasing tariffs could affect our results of operations and financial position 

various commodities including among others brass resins titanium dioxide zinc wood and glass are used to produce our products fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities have in the past and could increase the costs of our products our production of products could be affected if we or our suppliers are unable to procure our requirements for these commodities or if a shortage of these commodities drives their prices to levels that are not commercially feasible further the cost of certain of our raw materials and finished goods is increasing as a result of new tariffs tariffs and rising energy costs could increase our production and transportation costs   in addition water is a significant component of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

it can be difficult for us to pass on to customers our cost increases our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to sufficiently increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs including the impact of increasing tariffs our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices such reductions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

from time to time we enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of key commodities and to establish firm pricing but at times these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract occasionally we may also use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which has occurred and could occur in the future and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers 

we are dependent on third ‑ party suppliers for many of our products and components and our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate and timely supply of these products and components failure of our suppliers to timely provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or our policies regarding our supplier business practices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position or could damage our reputation sourcing these products and components from another supplier is timeconsuming and costly accordingly the loss of critical suppliers or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

many of the suppliers we rely upon are located in foreign countries the differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements changes in economic conditions and trade policies and laws and regulations together with the limited number of suppliers have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain or if there is a disruption in transporting the products or components our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

there are risks associated with our international operations and global strategies 

in 2018 19 percent  of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar in addition to our european operations we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties globally risks associated with our international operations include changes in political monetary and social environments economic conditions labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments social and political unrest terrorist attacks cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 

we are also affected by laws applicable to us companies doing business abroad or importing goods and materials these include tax laws laws regulating competition anti‑briberyanti‑corruption and other business practices and trade regulations including duties and tariffs compliance with these laws are costly and future changes to these laws may require significant management attention and disrupt our operations additionally while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure significant changes in how us and foreign jurisdictions tax cross‑border transactions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our results of operations and financial position are also impacted by changes in currency exchange rates unfavorable currency exchange rates particularly the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar and the chinese yuan renminbi have in the past adversely affected us and could adversely affect us in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

additionally as the situation involving the united kingdom’s decision to exit from the european union develops we could experience volatility in the currency exchange rates or a change in the demand for our products and services particularly in our uk and european markets or there could be disruption of our operations and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives of investing in our brands developing innovative products and focusing on operational excellence through the masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity all of these initiatives are designed to grow revenue improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid ‑  to long ‑ term our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization 

we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy or integrate businesses that we acquire 

pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions at acceptable terms and prices our long ‑ term competitive positioning may be affected even if we are successful in acquiring businesses we may experience risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business such risks include difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale diversion of our resources unforeseen liabilities issues or conflicts with our new or existing customers or suppliers and difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses future foreign acquisitions may also increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified   talented and diverse personnel who have the experience knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key strategic initiatives we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them from time to time we have been affected by a shortage of qualified personnel in certain geographic areas our growth competitive position and results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected by our failure to attract develop and retain key employees to build strong leadership teams or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess or by a shortage of qualified personnel 

we rely on information systems and technology and a breakdown of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we rely on many information systems and technology to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities we may be adversely affected if our information systems breakdown fail or are no longer supported in addition to the consequences that may occur from interruptions in our systems increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems 

we have implemented security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations despite these efforts our systems have been and in the future may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized access malicious software undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption exposure of proprietary or confidential information data corruption damage to the reputation of our brands damage to our relationships with our customers and suppliers exposure to litigation and increased operational costs such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation 

we may not experience the anticipated benefits from our investments in new technology   

we continue to invest in new technology systems throughout our company including implementations of enterprise resource planning “erp” systems at our business units erp implementations are complex and require significant management oversight while we are leveraging our experience and engaging consultants to assist as we deploy erp systems we have experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated expenses and interruptions to our operations during these implementations these interruptions could affect our ability to produce and ship goods to our customers or to timely report financial results and the effectiveness of our internal controls our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if we do not appropriately select and implement our new technology systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation of erp systems 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are involved in various claims and litigation including class actions and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have a material adverse effect on us the types of matters may include among others competition product liability employment warranty advertising contract personal injury   environmental intellectual property product compliance and insurance coverage the outcome and effect of these matters are inherently unpredictable and defending and resolving them can be costly and can divert management’s attention we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of claims and litigation 

we are also subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant costs and regardless of the ultimate outcome create adverse publicity and damage the reputation of our brands and business also we rely on other manufacturers to provide products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products and components we source from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of the risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover our losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

refer to note t to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

compliance with laws government regulation and industry standards is costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to 

 

in addition to complying with current requirements and known future requirements even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future as we sell new types of products or existing products in new geographic areas our failure to comply with the requirements applicable to those products or regions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with new or changed laws regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs our manufacturing processes our packaging or our sourcing compliance activities are costly and 

require significant management attention and resources if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us current and former employees contractors or suppliers have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by or disclosed to others including our competitors protecting and defending our intellectual property could be costly time consuming and require significant resources if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility 

we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement and in order to borrow under it we cannot be in default with any of those provisions our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be affected if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants in the past we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement our financial flexibility could be restricted

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as outlook believe anticipate appear may will should intend plan estimate expect assume seek forecast and similar references to future periods our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements

2018  results 

net sales were positively impacted by the acquisition of the ld kichler co kichler in march 2018 and mercury plastics inc mercury in december 2017 net sales were also positively impacted by increased sales volume resulting from increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction in the us and net selling price increases primarily in the us such increases were partially offset by the divestiture of moores furniture group limited moores in the fourth quarter of 2017 and arrow fastener co llc arrow in the second quarter of 2017 our results of operations were negatively impacted by increased other expenses such as logistics costs salaries and enterprise resource planning system erp costs and the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as part of the acquisition of kichler such negative impacts were partially offset by benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and increased sales volume 

our plumbing products segment was negatively impacted by an increase in commodity costs unfavorable sales mix and an increase in other expenses such as salaries logistics costs and erp costs these negative impacts were partially offset by increased sales volume the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and increased net selling prices our decorative architectural products segment was negatively impacted by an increase in commodity costs the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as part of the acquisition of kichler and increased depreciation and amortization expense these negative impacts were partially offset by increased net selling prices of paints and other coating products benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and increased sales volume our cabinetry products segment was negatively impacted by an increase in other expenses such as logistics costs program launch and display expenses and unfavorable sales mix these negative impacts were partially offset by benefits associated with cost savings initiatives increased sales volume and the divestiture of moores our windows and other specialty products segment was negatively impacted by an increase in other expenses such as warrantyrelated costs and higher labor costs an increase in commodity costs decreased sales volume and the divestiture of arrow these negative impacts were partially offset by increased net selling prices and the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

note a to the consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as control of our products is transferred to our customers which is generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with our customers or when services are completed control over certain of our custommade window products transfers to our customers as production is completed and revenue is recognized over the production period for these products as our products do not have an alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment during the production period the production period of our custommade window products generally does not lapse days and for these products we currently recognize revenue based on the output of production which is a faithful depiction of the transfer of these products to our customers we provide customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives these customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration we include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved this determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale and expected sales volume for ecasts as it relates to our volumebased incentives this determination is updated each reporting period     

we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances where a risk of default has been identified and also include a provision for noncustomer specific defaults based upon historical collection return and writeoff activity 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits and currently a two to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated repair and remodel activity and estimated housing starts our assumptions included a relatively 

stable us gross domestic product growing at approximately 25 percent per annum and a eurozone gross domestic product growing at approximately 19 percent per annum over the fiveyear forecast 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 90 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital increased in 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily due to an increased market required rate of return on equity as well as an   increase in the aftertax cost of debt which was driven by a reduction in the effective tax rate  in 2018  based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 110 percent to 135 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

in the fourth quarter of 2018  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in an impairment for any reporting unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of an other indefinitelived intangible asset to its carrying value we utilized a relieffromroyalty model to estimate the fair value of other indefinitelived intangible assets we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm we also consider the profitability of the business among other factors to determine the royalty rate for use in the impairment assessment 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 90 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows in 2018  based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 120 percent to 135 percent for our other indefinitelived intangible assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2018  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for our other indefinitelived intangible assets were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our other indefinitelived intangible assets would have resulted in a 4 million impairment for trade names related to businesses acquired within the past two years 

employee retirement plans 

as of january 1 2010 substantially all our domestic and foreign qualified and domestic nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans were frozen to future benefit accruals 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2018  our discount rate for obligations increased  to a weighted average of 38 percent from 33 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2018  willis towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 15 percent to 42 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 41 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 70 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets based upon an analysis of expected and historical rates of return of various asset classes utilizing the current and longterm target asset allocation of the plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased  to 226 million  at december 31 2018  from 266 million  at 

december 31 2017  our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans decreased to 155 million  at december 31 2018  from 170 million  at december 31 2017  these unfunded plans are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 90 percent to 115 percent 

the decrease  in our qualified definedbenefit pension plan projected benefit obligation was primarily impacted by an increase in the discount rate during 2018  we contributed 52 million  to our qualified definedbenefit pension plans and our qualified definedbenefit pension plan assets had a return of negative 49 percent refer to note m to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 16 million in 2019  compared with 8 million  in 2018  if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was 50 basis points lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2019  pension expense would increase by 4 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 8 million in 2019  compared to 9 million  in 2018  

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 15 million in 2019  to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans however we currently anticipate contributing approximately 66 million in 2019  refer to note m to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the funding of our plans 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial 

statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the future realization of deferred tax 

assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income 

include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

we maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2018  should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows for changes in the income tax environment and to a greater extent the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions which may affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing 

authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated 

matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

the comprehensive us tax reform which generally became effective in 2018 has had a significant impact on our effective tax rate and taxes paid primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the additional us taxes on our foreign earnings the continued impact from us tax reform may differ from our current estimates due to the issuance and finalization of future regulatory guidance 

warranty 

we offer full and limited warranties on certain products with warranty periods ranging up to the lifetime of the product to the original consumer purchaser at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated future 

cost to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products to satisfy our warranty obligations our estimate of future costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage the warranty period historical experience specific to the nature frequency and average cost to service the claim along with industry and demographic trends 

certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from our original estimates which would require us to adjust our previously established accruals refer to note t to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our warranty accrual 

a significant portion of our business is at the consumer retail level through home center retailers and other major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and an estimate of these amounts is recorded as a deduction to net sales at the time of sale 

litigation 

we are involved in claims and litigation including class actions and regulatory proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when a liability is probable of being incurred and our exposure in these matters is reasonably estimable amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments 

corporate development strategy 

we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing core businesses and complementing our existing business with strategic acquisitions 

in addition we actively manage our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that do not align with our longterm growth strategy we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses if any may not align with our longterm growth strategy 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations the issuance of notes in the financial markets bank borrowings and the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies our capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in our business balancing share repurchases with potential acquisitions and maintaining an appropriate dividend 

our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 98 percent  and 94 percent  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively refer to note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on april 16 2018 we repaid and retired all of our 114 million  6625  notes on the scheduled repayment date 

on june 21 2017 we issued 300 million  of 35  notes due november 15 2027 and 300 million  of 45  notes due may 15 2047 we received proceeds of 599 million net of discount for the issuance of these notes the notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price on june 27 2017 proceeds from the debt issuances together with cash on hand were used to repay and early retire 299 million  of our 7125  notes due march 15 2020 74 million  of our 595  notes due march 15 2022 62 million  of our 775  notes due august 1 2029 and 100 million  of our 65  notes due august 15 2032 in connection with these early retirements we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of 107 million  which was recorded as interest expense 

on march 17 2016  we issued 400 million  of 35  notes due april 1 2021 and 500 million  of 4375  notes due april 1 2026 we received proceeds of 896 million net of discount for the issuance of these notes the notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price on april 15 2016 proceeds from the debt issuances together with cash on hand were used to repay and early retire all of our 1 billion  6125  notes which were due on october 3 2016 and all of our 300 million  585  notes which were due on march 15 2017 in connection with these early retirements we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of 40 million which was recorded as interest expense 

on march 28 2013 we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion  and a maturity date of march 28 2018 on may 29 2015 and august 28 2015 we amended the credit agreement with the bank group the amended credit agreement the amended credit agreement reduces the aggregate commitment to 750 million  and extends the maturity date to may 29 2020 under the amended credit agreement at our request and subject to certain conditions we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional 375 million  with the current bank group or new lenders refer to note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the amended credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a a maximum net leverage ratio as adjusted for certain items of 40 to 10 and b a minimum interest coverage ratio as adjusted for certain items equal to or greater than 25 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under our amended credit agreement at december 31 2018  we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants through at least the next year 

on march 9 2018 we acquired substantially all of the net assets of kichler the purchase price net of 2 million cash acquired consisted of 549 million paid with cash on hand 

in the third quarter of 2018 we increased our quarterly dividend to 12 per common share from 105 per common share during 2018 we repurchased 186 million  shares of our common stock for cash aggregating 654 million  

we had cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits of approximately 559 million  at december 31 2018  our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts time deposit accounts and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments our shortterm bank deposits consist of time deposits with maturities of 12 months or less 

of the 559 million  and 13 billion  of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits we held at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 270 million and 759 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us would not result in significant additional us income tax or foreign withholding tax as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro british pound and the us dollar occasionally we have also used derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis we currently do not have any derivative instruments for which we have designated hedge accounting 

our current ratio was 16  to 1 and 20  to 1 at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the decrease in our current ratio is due primarily to the cash on hand we paid for our acquisition of kichler partially offset by the acquired working capital 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



our working capital days were as follows 



net cash provided by operations of 1032 million  consisted primarily of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization expense of 156 million  stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays changes in working capital amounts as well as employee withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation which is classified as a financing activity these amounts were partially offset by contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans 

net cash used for financing activities was 1020 million  primarily due to 654 million  for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value 134 million  for the payment of cash dividends 114 million  for the retirement of our 6625 of notes due april 15 2018 89 million  for dividends paid to noncontrolling interests and 42 million  for employee withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation 

in may 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase for retirement of up to 15 billion of shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise during 2018 we repurchased and retired 186 million  shares of our common stock including 07 million  shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2018 at december 31 2018 we had 636 million  remaining under the authorization consistent with past practice and as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value we anticipate using approximately 600 million of cash for share repurchases including shares which will be purchased to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted as part of our compensation programs in 2019 

net cash used for  investing activities was 651 million  primarily driven by 549 million  for the acquisition of kichler net of cash acquired and 219 million  for capital expenditures partially offset by 108 million  of net proceeds from the disposition of shortterm bank deposits 

we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2018  were 219 million  compared with 173 million  for 2017  and 180 million  for 2016  for 2019  capital expenditures excluding any potential acquisitions are expected to be approximately 200 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2018  totaled 156 million  compared with 127 million  for 2017  and 134 million  for 2016  for 2019  depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2019  acquisitions is expected to be approximately 175 million amortization expense totaled 24 million in 2018  compared with 11 million and 10 million in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations and our ability to utilize our amended credit agreement are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results under gaap 

the following discussion of consolidated results of operations compares each respective period to the same period of the immediately preceding year 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2018  were 84 billion  which increased nine percent compared to 2017  excluding acquisitions divestitures and the effect of currency translation net sales increased five percent the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions divestitures and the effect of currency translation in millions 



net sales for 2018  increased five percent due to the acquisition of kichler in march 2018 and mercury in december 2017 net sales were also positively impacted by increased sales volume of plumbing products and cabinetry which in aggregate increased sales by three percent and net selling price increases of paints and other coating products plumbing products and windows which in aggregate increased sales by two percent foreign currency translation also increased sales by one percent net sales for 2018  were negatively affected by the divestiture of our arrow and moores businesses which in aggregate decreased sales by one percent 

net sales for 2017 were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products paints and other coating products and builders hardware which in aggregate increased sales by four percent net sales for 2017 were also positively affected by favorable sales mix of cabinets north american plumbing products and north american windows as well as net selling price increases of windows and international plumbing products which in aggregate increased sales two percent net sales for 2017 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets the 

divestiture of our arrow and moores businesses and an unfavorable sales mix of international plumbing products which in aggregate decreased sales by two percent

our gross profit margins were 322  percent 342 percent and 334 percent in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the 2018  gross profit margin was negatively impacted by an increase in commodity costs the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as a part of the the acquisition of kichler an increase in other expenses such as logistics costs and salaries and unfavorable sales mix these negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in net selling prices the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and increased sales volume the 2017 gross profit margin was positively impacted by increased sales volume a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs and cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 177  percent in 2018  compared with 186 percent in 2017  and 187 percent in 2016  the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was driven by leverage of fixed expenses due primarily to increased sales volume and improved cost control 

the following table reconciles reported operating profit to operating profit as adjusted to exclude certain items dollars in millions 



operating profit margin in 2018  was negatively affected by an increase in commodity costs the recognition of the inventory step up adjustment established as a part of the the acquisition of kichler and an increase in other expenses such as logistics costs salaries and erp costs these negative impacts were partially offset by increased net selling prices benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and increased sales volume operating profit margin in 2017 was positively impacted by increased sales volume cost savings initiatives and a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs operating profit margin in 2017 was negatively impacted by an increase in strategic growth investments and certain other expenses including stockbased compensation health insurance costs trade show costs and increased head count 

due to the recentlyannounced increase in tariffs on imported materials from china and assuming tariffs rise to 25 percent in 2019 we could be exposed to approximately 150 million of potential annual direct cost increases we will work to mitigate the impact of these tariffs through a combination of price increases supplier negotiations supply chain repositioning and other internal productivity measures 

other income expense net 

other net for 2018 included 14 million  of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost and 8 million  of realized foreign currency losses these expenses were partially offset by 3 million  of earnings related to equity method investments and 1 million  related to distributions from private equity funds 

other net for 2017 included 26 million  related to periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 13 million  net loss related to the divestitures of moores and arrow and 2 million  related to the impairment of a private equity fund partially offset by 3 million  related to distributions from private equity funds and 1 million  of earnings related to equity method investments

interest expense was 156 million  278 million  and 229 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in interest expense from 2017 to 2018 is primarily the result of a loss on debt extinguishment of 107 million which was recorded as additional interest expense in connection with the early retirement of debt in 2017 the discharge of indebtedness in 2018 and refinancing certain debt at more favorable interest rates in 2017 the increase in interest expense from 2016 to 2017 is primarily the result of the 107 million and 40 million losses on debt extinguishment which were recorded as additional interest expense in connection with the early retirement of debt in 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase was partially offset by the discharge of indebtedness in 2016 as well as refinancing certain debt at more favorable interest rates 

net income and income per common share attributable to masco corporation 

net income and diluted income per common share for 2018  were 734 million  and 237  per common share respectively net income and diluted income per common share for 2017  were 533 million  and 166  per common share respectively net income and diluted income per common share for 2016  were 493 million  and 148  per common share respectively 

our effective tax rate was 25 percent 34 percent and 36 percent in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively us tax reform which generally became effective in 2018 reduced the us federal tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent additionally effective january 1 2017 we adopted asu 201609 which requires the tax effects related to employee stockbased payments to be recorded to income tax expense thus increasing the volatility in our effective tax rate our normalized tax rate was 25 percent 34 percent and 36 percent in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 our normalized rate was changed from 26 percent to 25 percent primarily due to a reduction in our us tax on foreign earnings attributable to global intangible lowtaxed income as a result of recently issued irs regulatory guidance our 2018 effective tax rate equaled our normalized rate 

the 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by divestiture of businesses with no tax impact this impact was offset by a 17 million net tax benefit from the impact of changes in us federal tax law and a 20 million tax benefit from stockbased compensation payments recognized in 2017 

the 2016 effective tax rate includes a 14 million charge to tax expense from the elimination of a disproportionate tax effect resulting from our auction rate securities being called by our counterparty during 2016 this charge was offset by a 13 million tax benefit from the recognition of a deferred tax asset on certain german net operating losses primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability 

refer to note r to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

outlook for the company

operating margins in the windows and other specialty products segment in 2018 were negatively impacted by an increase in other expenses such as warrantyrelated costs and higher labor costs increased commodity costs decreased sales volume of international windows and the divestiture of arrow these negative impacts were partially offset by increased net selling prices and benefits associated with costs savings initiatives 

operating margins in this segment in 2017 were positively affected by a decrease in warranty adjustments cost savings initiatives and a favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs of north american windows 

operating margins in this segment decreased in 2016 due to a 31 million increase in our estimate of expected future warranty claims relating to previously sold windows and doors the change in estimate resulted from the adoption of an improved warranty valuation model and the availability of additional information used to support the estimate of costs to service claims and recent warranty claim trends including a shift to increased costs to repair operating margins also decreased due to increases in certain other expenses such as higher labor costs and erp system implementation costs at our north american windows business such costs were partially offset by a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs of north american windows 

business rationalizations and other initiatives 

over the last several years we have taken several actions focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations plant closures head count reductions and other cost savings initiatives in 2018  2017  and 2016  we incurred net pretax costs and charges related to these initiatives of 14 million  4 million  and 22 million  respectively 

we continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalizations and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations although we do not anticipate that the related costs will be as significant as they have been historically 

during 2018  our plumbing products segment incurred costs and charges of 9 million  primarily related to plant closure costs in north america our windows and other specialty products segment incurred costs of 5 million  primarily related to plant closure costs and severance in the united kingdom 

during 2017  our plumbing products segment incurred costs and charges of 2 million  primarily related to plant closure costs and severance in north america our cabinetry products segment incurred costs of 2 million  primarily related to plant closure costs in north america 

during 2016  our plumbing products segment incurred costs of 13 million  primarily related to plant closure costs in canada and at our international operations as well as severance costs across multiple businesses our cabinetry products segment incurred costs and charges of 8 million  primarily related to cost savings initiatives in north america lastly our windows and other specialty products segment incurred costs of 1 million  related to severance at our us windows business

we believe that our solid results of operations and financial position for 2017  resulted from our continued focus on our three strategic pillars driving the full potential of our core businesses leveraging opportunities across our businesses and actively managing our portfolio 

to drive the full potential of our core businesses during 2017  we continued to pursue sales growth opportunities by introducing new products enhancing services and penetrating adjacent markets in addition we continued to reduce costs and capitalize on synergies across our businesses with standardized operating tools cost saving initiatives and the implementation of lean principles and process improvements in many areas including production and functional support processes as a result we grew both our top and bottom lines 

we also continued to leverage the collective strength of our enterprise the second pillar of our strategy we provided new assignments to selected leaders across our business units to further develop talent and facilitate operational improvements we continued to realize supply chain efficiencies through strategic sourcing and to share best practices across all of our functional departments to enhance productivity we believe this contributed to our results of operations improving as compared to the prior year 

additionally we continued to actively manage our portfolio the third pillar of our strategy and remain committed to making selective acquisitions in attractive end markets during 2017 we acquired a us plastics processor and manufacturer of water handling systems in our plumbing products segment and signed a definitive agreement to acquire the ld kichler co a leader in decorative residential and light commercial lighting products ceiling fans and led lighting systems which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 we also divested our us fastener and tool business and our uk manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom furniture business in addition we repurchased over 9 million  shares of our common stock and increased our quarterly dividend by 5 percent which further enhanced value for our shareholders

our business segments 

we report our financial results in four business segments aggregated by similarity in products the following tables set forth the contribution of our segments to net sales and operating profit loss for the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  additional financial information concerning our operations by segment and by geographic regions as well as general corporate expense net as of and for the threeyear period ended december 31 2017  is set forth in note o to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 





 

 all of our operating segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for repair and remodel activity and new home construction 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us 

 

 

 

 

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe competitors of the majority of our products in this segment include lixil group corporation’s american standard brands and grohe products kohler co fortune brands home  security incs moen rohl and riobel brands and spectrum brands holdings llc’s pfister faucets competitors of our spas and exercise pools and systems include jacuzzi master spas and dynasty spas foreign manufacturers competing with us are located primarily in germany and china we face significant competition from private label products many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price the businesses in 

our plumbing products segment manufacture products in north america europe and asia and source products from asia and other regions competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation product features and innovation product quality customer service breadth of product offering and price 

many of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have multiple sources both domestic and foreign for the raw materials used in this segment and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc to help reduce the impact of this volatility from time to time we may enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers or occasionally use derivative instruments 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we acquired mercury plastics inc mercury a us plastics processor and manufacturer of water handling systems this acquisition enhances our ability to develop faucet technology and provides continuity of supply of quality faucet components 

decorative architectural products 

we produce architectural coatings including paints primers specialty paints stains and waterproofing products these products are sold in north america south america and china under the brand names behr ®  kilz ®  and other trademarks to “do‑it‑yourself” and professional customers through home center retailers and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 25 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  our behr products are sold through the home depot our largest customer overall as well as this segment’s largest customer the loss of this segment’s sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

our competitors in this segment include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic ppg sherwin‑williams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection and that competition in this industry is also based largely on product features and innovation product quality customer service and price 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of architectural coatings the price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of global supply and demand dynamics and production capacity limitations which can have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment natural gas derivatives and acrylic resins derived from crude oil are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant price fluctuations in either natural gas derivatives or crude oil can also impact our costs in this segment we have agreements with certain significant suppliers for this segment that are intended to help assure continued supply 

our decorative architectural products segment also includes branded cabinet door and window hardware functional hardware glass shower doors wall plates hook and rail products and picture hanging accessories which are manufactured for us and sold to home center retailers mass retailers ecommerce retailers other specialty retailers original equipment manufacturers and wholesalers these products are sold under the liberty ®  brainerd ®  and other trademarks and our key competitors in north america include amerock top knobs richelieu and private label brands decorative bath hardware shower accessories and shower doors are sold under the brand names delta ®  and franklin brass ®  to wholesalers home center retailers mass retailers and other specialty retailers competitors for these products include moen kohler gatco and private label brands

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states includes several large companies and numerous local and regional businesses with whom we compete we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product features and selection product quality and price our competitors in this segment include american woodmark corporation fortune brands home  security inc and elkay 

the raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber plywood and particleboard and are available from multiple sources both domestic and foreign some of the materials we import may be subject to customs duties 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we divested moores furniture group limited moores a manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom furniture in the united kingdom

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity both of which are cyclical 

our business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity a number of factors affect consumers’ spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity including 

 

the fundamentals driving our business are cyclical and adverse changes or uncertainty involving the factors listed above could result in a decline in spending on residential repair and remodeling activity and a decline in demand for new home construction which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we could lose market share if we do not maintain our strong brands develop new products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences or if our reputation is damaged 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products while we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness these initiatives may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if we do not introduce new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance we could lose market share which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position it is also possible that our competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do which could adversely affect our market share 

in recent years consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers’ business models and strategies have changed as our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure including maintaining robust and userfriendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and to provide comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development if we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers our brands may lose market share 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our public image and reputation are important to maintaining our strong brands and could be adversely affected by various factors including product quality and service claims and comments in social media or the press or negative publicity regarding disputes or legal action against us even if unfounded damage to our public image or reputation could adversely affect our sales and results of operations and financial position 

we face significant competition 

our products face significant competition we believe that brand reputation is an important factor affecting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features and innovation product quality customer service warranty and price we sell many of our products through home center retailers online retailers distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers our success with our customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery in addition home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly marketing directly to professional contractors and installers which may affect our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

we also compete with low ‑ cost foreign manufacturers and private label brands sold by our customers in a variety of our product groups as market dynamics change we may experience a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more value ‑ priced or opening price point products which may affect our ability to maintain or gain market share andor our profitability 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries   our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers 

our sales are concentrated with our two largest customers in 2017 our net sales to the home depot were 25 billion approximately 33 percent of our consolidated net sales and our net sales to lowe’s were less than 10   percent of our consolidated net sales our reliance on these significant customers may further increase if the mix of our business operations changes including as a result of acquisitions or divestitures these home center retailers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them additionally these home center retailers may reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us although other retailers dealers distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services we might not be able to quickly replace if at all the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to lowe’s and any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further as these home center retailers expand their markets and targeted customers and as consumer purchasing practices change and e ‑ commerce increases conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur which could affect our results of operations and financial position our relationships with these customers may be affected if we increase the amount of business we transact directly with consumers and professionals in addition these home center retailers are granted product exclusivity from time to time which increases the complexity of our product offerings and our costs and may affect our ability to offer products to other customers  

variability in commodity costs or limited availability of commodities could affect our results of operations and financial position 

various commodities including among others brass resins titanium dioxide zinc wood and glass are used to produce our products fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products our production of products could also be affected if we or our suppliers are unable to procure our requirements for these commodities or if a shortage of these commodities drives their prices to levels that are not commercially feasible further increases in energy costs could increase our production and transportation costs   in addition water is a significant component of many of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

it can be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices such reductions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

from time to time we enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of key commodities and to establish firm pricing but at times these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract occasionally we also may use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which has occurred and could occur in the future and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers 

we are dependent on third ‑ party suppliers for many of our products and components and our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate andor timely supply of these products and components failure of our suppliers to timely provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant costs accordingly the loss of critical suppliers or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

many of the suppliers upon whom we rely are located in foreign countries the differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements and laws and regulations together with the limited number of suppliers have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain or if there is a disruption in transporting the products or components our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

there are risks associated with international operations and global strategies 

approximately 21 percent  of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar in addition to our european operations we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties globally risks associated with our international operations include changes in political monetary and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments social and political unrest terrorist attacks cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 

our results of operations and financial position are also affected by international economic conditions primarily in europe unfavorable currency conversion rates particularly the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar and the chinese yuan renminbi have in the past adversely affected us and could adversely affect us in the future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

as the situation involving the united kingdom’s decision to exit from the european union develops we could experience volatility in the currency exchange rates andor a change in the demand for our products and services particularly in our uk and european markets or there could be disruption of our operations and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

we are also affected by laws applicable to us companies doing business abroad or importing goods and materials these include tax laws laws regulating competition anti ‑ briberyanti ‑ corruption and other business practices and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure significant changes in how us and foreign jurisdictions tax cross ‑ border transactions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives of investing in our brands developing innovative products and focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity into our business units all of these initiatives are designed to grow revenue improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid ‑  to long ‑ term our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization 

we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy or integrate businesses that we acquire 

pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions at acceptable terms and prices our long ‑ term competitive positioning may be affected even if we are successful in acquiring businesses we may experience risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business such risks include difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale diversion of our resources unforeseen liabilities issues with the new or existing customers or suppliers and difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses future foreign acquisitions may also increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs andor fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified   talented and diverse personnel who have the experience knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key strategic initiatives we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them we have been affected by a shortage of qualified personnel in certain geographic areas our growth competitive position and results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected by our failure to attract develop and retain key employees to build strong leadership teams or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess or by a shortage of qualified personnel 

we may not experience the anticipated benefits from our investments in new technology 

we are making significant investments in new technology systems throughout our company including concurrent implementations of enterprise resource planning “erp” systems at our larger business units erp implementations are complex and require significant management oversight while we are leveraging our experience and engaging consultants to assist as we deploy erp systems we have experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated expenses and interruptions to our operations during these implementations these interruptions could affect our ability to produce and ship goods to our customers or to timely report financial results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected if we do not appropriately select and implement our new technology systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation of erp systems 

we rely on information systems and technology and a breakdown of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we rely on many information systems and technology to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities we may be adversely affected if our information systems breakdown fail or are no longer supported in addition to the consequences that may occur from interruptions in our systems increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems and a cybersecurity breach could disrupt our operations we have established security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations 

despite these efforts our systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access malicious software undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption exposure of proprietary or confidential information data corruption damage to our reputation and the reputation of our brands exposure to litigation and increased operational costs such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation 

we may not be able to sustain the improved results of our us window business 

our us window business milgard manufacturing incorporated “milgard” has experienced operational issues and production inefficiencies in addition milgard’s phased deployment of a new erp system to improve its business processes has been complex and requires significant management oversight and resources while milgard’s results are improving there is no assurance that we will be able to sustain this improvement or that our turnaround plan will continue to be successful milgard has also been affected by a shortage of qualified personnel in certain geographic areas if milgard experiences unanticipated expenses setbacks or additional disruptions to its operations   our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected    

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are involved in various claims and litigation including class actions and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have a material adverse effect on us the types of matters may include among others competition product liability employment warranty advertising contract personal injury   environmental intellectual property and insurance coverage given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter defending and resolving claims and litigation can be costly and can divert management’s attention we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of claims and litigation 

we are also subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant costs and regardless of the ultimate outcome create adverse publicity and damage the reputation of our brands and business also we rely on other manufacturers to provide products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products and components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of the risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

refer to note s to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

compliance with laws government regulation and industry standards could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign government laws and regulations including securities laws tax laws antibriberyanticorruption laws and employment laws as well as those pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers product compliance competition practices import and export regulations data privacy and the collection and storage of information climate change and environmental issues in addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future as we sell new types of products or existing products in new geographic areas our failure to comply with the requirements applicable to those products or regions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with these laws regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs our manufacturing processes our packaging or our sourcing compliance activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us current and former employees contractors or suppliers 

have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by or disclosed to others including our competitors protecting and defending our intellectual property could be costly time consuming and require significant resources if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility 

we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement and in order to borrow under it we cannot be in default with any of those provisions our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be affected if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants in the past we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement our financial flexibility could be restricted

tableend the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as believe anticipate appear may will should intend plan estimate expect assume seek forecast and similar references to future periods our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements

executive level overview 

we design manufacture and distribute branded home improvement and building products these products are sold primarily for repair and remodeling activity and new home construction through home center retailers mass merchandisers hardware stores homebuilders distributors online retailers and direct to the consumer 

2017  results 

net sales were positively affected by increased sales volume resulting from increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction net selling price increases in europe and the us and favorable sales mix in the us such increases were partially offset by the divestitures of arrow and moores and unfavorable sales mix in europe our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume cost savings initiatives and a more favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs in europe such increases were partially offset by an increase in strategic growth investments and certain other expenses including stockbased compensation health insurance costs trade show costs and increased head count 

our plumbing products segment benefited from increased sales volume cost savings initiatives and a favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs and was negatively impacted by an increase in investments in strategic growth initiatives and certain other expenses including trade show costs and increased head count our decorative architectural products segment was negatively affected by an unfavorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs of paints and other coating products and an increase in strategic growth investments to support the expansion of pro paint sales and new programs in builders hardware and was positively impacted by increased sales volume and cost savings initiatives our cabinetry products segment was positively affected by cost savings initiatives as well as favorable sales mix and was negatively affected by decreased sales volume costs to support new product launches in north america antidumping and countervailing duties and an unfavorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs our windows and other specialty products segment benefited from a decrease in warranty adjustments as well as cost savings initiatives and a favorable relationship between net selling prices and commodity costs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

note a to the consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances where a risk of default has been identified and also include a provision for noncustomer specific defaults based upon historical collection return and writeoff activity 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and currently a two percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated repair and remodel activity and estimated housing starts our assumptions included a relatively stable us gross domestic product growing at approximately 23 percent per annum and a euro zone gross domestic product growing at approximately 15 to 17 percent per annum over the fiveyear forecast 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 80 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily due to reductions in the risk free rate in 2017  based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 100 percent to 130 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit 

in the fourth quarter of 2017  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in an impairment for any reporting unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 2017  we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets 

employee retirement plans 

as of january 1 2010 substantially all of our domestic and foreign qualified and domestic nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans were frozen to future benefit accruals 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2017  our discount rate for obligations decreased  to a weighted average of 33 percent from 35 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2017  willis towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 15 percent to 36 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 34 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets based upon an analysis of expected and historical rates of return of various asset classes utilizing the current and longterm asset allocation of the plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased  to 266 million  at december 31 2017  from 338 million  at december 31 2016  our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 170 million  at both december 31 2017  and 2016  these unfunded plans are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 80 percent to 108 percent 

the decrease  in our qualified definedbenefit pension plan projected benefit obligation was impacted primarily by the divestiture of moores due to the transfer of 144 million of plan obligations to the purchaser in connection with the sale of the business a change to the mp 2017 mortality improvement scale also decreased our longterm pension liabilities the decrease was partially offset by a lower discount rate compared to the prior year during 2017  we contributed 52 million  to our qualified definedbenefit pension plans additionally our qualified definedbenefit pension plan assets had a net gain of 139 percent in 2017  refer to note l to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 12 million in 2018  compared with 20 million  in 2017  if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2018  pension expense would increase by 4 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 8 million in 2018  compared to 9 million  in 2017  

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 25 million in 2018  to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans however we currently anticipate contributing approximately 61 million in 2018 refer to note l to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the funding of our plans 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

we maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017 should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

the comprehensive us tax reform which is generally effective in 2018 is expected to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate and taxes paid primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the additional us and foreign taxes on our foreign earnings the impact from us tax reform may differ from our current estimates due to the issuance of future regulatory guidance that differs from our current interpretation as a result of this new legislation we currently anticipate our effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 26 percent we intend to allocate the benefit from lower cash tax payments to our existing capital allocation strategy 

warranty 

we offer full and limited warranties on certain products with warranty periods ranging up to the lifetime of the product to the original consumer purchaser at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated future cost to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products to satisfy our warranty obligations our estimate of future costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage the warranty period historical experience specific to the nature frequency and average cost to service the claim along with industry and demographic trends 

certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from our original estimates which would require us to adjust our previously established accruals refer to note s to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

a significant portion of our business is at the consumer retail level through home center retailers and other major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and an estimate of these amounts is recorded as a deduction to net sales at the time of sale 

litigation 

we are involved in claims and litigation including class actions and regulatory proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure in these matters meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments 

corporate development strategy 

we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing core businesses and complementing our existing business with strategic acquisitions particularly in the plumbing products and decorative architectural products segments 

in addition we actively manage our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that do not align with our longterm growth strategy we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses if any may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations the issuance of notes in the financial markets longterm bank debt and the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies our capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in our business balancing share repurchases with potential acquisitions and maintaining an appropriate dividend 

our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 95 percent  and 104 percent  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively refer to note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on june 21 2017 we issued 300 million of 35 notes due november 15 2027 and 300 million of 45 notes due may 15 2047 we received proceeds of 599 million net of discount for the issuance of these notes the notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price on june 27 2017 proceeds from the debt issuances together with cash on hand were used to repay and early retire 299 million of our 7125 notes due march 15 2020 74 million of our 595 notes due march 15 2022 62 million of our 775 notes due august 1 2029 and 100 million of our 65 notes due august 15 2032 in connection with these early retirements we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of 107 million which was recorded as interest expense

on march 28 2013 we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion  and a maturity date of march 28 2018 on may 29 2015 and august 28 2015 we amended the credit agreement with the bank group the amended credit agreement the amended credit agreement reduces the aggregate commitment to 750 million  and extends the maturity date to may 29 2020 under the amended credit agreement at our request and subject to certain conditions we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional 375 million  with the current bank group or new lenders refer to note j to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the amended credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a a maximum net leverage ratio as adjusted for certain items of 40 to 10 and b a minimum interest coverage ratio as adjusted for certain items equal to or greater than 25 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under our 

amended credit agreement at december 31 2017  we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants through at least the next year 

we had cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits of approximately 13 billion  at december 31 2017  our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts time deposit accounts and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments our shortterm bank deposits consist of time deposits with maturities of 12 months or less 

of the 13 billion  and 12 billion  of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits we held at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 759 million and 618 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us would not result in significant additional us income tax or foreign withholding tax as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro british pound and the us dollar occasionally we have also used derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis we currently do not have any derivative instruments for which we have designated hedge accounting 

in the third quarter of 2017 we increased our quarterly dividend to 105 per common share from 10 per common share during 2017 we repurchased 92 million  shares of our common stock for cash aggregating 331 million  

in december 2017 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the ld kichler co kichler a leader in decorative residential and light commercial lighting products ceiling fans and led lighting systems this business will expand our product offerings to repair and remodel customers we expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2018 at which time we expect to pay approximately 550 million for the business using cash on hand we intend to report this business in our decorative architectural products segment 

our current ratio was 20  to 1 at both december 31 2017  and 2016  

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



our working capital days were as follows 



net cash provided by operations of 751 million  consisted primarily of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization expense of 127 million  stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays as well as cash items which are classified as financing activities including debt extinguishment costs of 104 million and employee withholding taxes paid on stockbased compensation these amounts were partially offset by changes in working capital resulting primarily from an increase in inventory levels to support our growth and new programs and changes in contract terms with certain customers net cash provided by operations was also impacted by contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans

interest expense was 278 million  229 million  and 225 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively interest expense increased  in 2017 and 2016 due primarily to the 107 million and 40 million losses on debt extinguishment which were recorded as additional interest expense in connection with the early retirement of debt in 2017 and 2016 respectively these increases were partially offset by the discharge of indebtedness 2016 only as well as refinancing certain debt at more favorable interest rates

our effective tax rate was 34 percent 36 percent and 43 percent in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively effective january 1 2017 we adopted asu 201609 which requires the tax effects related to employee stockbased payments to be recorded to income tax expense thus increasing the volatility in our effective tax rate our normalized tax rate was 34 percent in 2017 compared to 36 percent in 2016 and 2015 

our 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by divestitures of businesses with no tax impact this impact was offset by a 17 million net tax benefit from the impact of changes in the us federal tax law and a 20 million tax benefit from stockbased compensation payments recognized in 2017 

our 2016 effective tax rate includes a 14 million charge to tax expense from the elimination of a disproportionate tax effect resulting from our auction rate securities being called by our counterparty during 2016 this charge was offset by a 13 million tax benefit from the recognition of a deferred tax asset on certain german net operating losses primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability 

compared to our normalized tax rate of 36 percent the variance in 2015  is due primarily to a 21 million valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets of topbuild recorded as a noncash charge to income tax expense the topbuild deferred tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off topbuild into a separate company that on a standalone basis as of june 30 2015 the spin off date was unlikely to be able to realize the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses 

the 2015  effective tax rate also includes a 19 million charge to income tax expense to recognize the required taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted this charge was the result of our determination that we may need to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested in order to provide greater flexibility in the execution of our capital management strategy

we believe that the actions we have taken over the last few years have positioned our company for further enhancement of shareholder value with strong and consistent growth we will continue to actively manage our portfolio identify growth opportunities in key industries and produce new products that differentiate us in the marketplace by combining design and innovation by focusing on our disciplined execution of our strategy we believe that our positive momentum will continue

 all of our operating segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for repair and remodel activity and new home construction 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us 

 

 

 

 

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe competitors of our spas and exercise pools and systems include jacuzzi master spas and dynasty spas our major competitors of our other products in this segment include lixil group corporation’s american standard brands and grohe products kohler co fortune brands home  security incs moen brands and spectrum brands holdings llc’s pfister faucets foreign manufacturers competing with us are located primarily in germany and china we face significant competition from private label products many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price the businesses in our plumbing 

products segment manufacture products in north america europe and asia and source products from asia and other regions in addition to price we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection competition for our plumbing products is based largely on customer service product quality product features and innovation and breadth of product offering 

many of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have multiple sources both domestic and foreign for the raw materials used in this segment and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc to help reduce the impact of this volatility from time to time we may enter into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers or use derivative instruments 

decorative architectural products

our competitors include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic ppg sherwin‑williams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection and that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality features and innovation and customer service 

fluctuations in raw material costs can have a material impact on this segment’s results of operations significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas both of which are used to produce the acrylic resins we purchase for our architectural coatings can adversely affect our costs the prices of titanium dioxide used in architectural coatings as well as acrylic resins can fluctuate based on global supply and demand dynamics and production capacity limitations to help assure continued availability of the major raw materials used in this segment we have entered into agreements with certain significant suppliers 

our decorative architectural products segment also includes branded cabinet hardware functional hardware wall plates hook and rail products and picture hanging accessories which are manufactured for us and sold to home center retailers mass retailers other specialty retailers original equipment manufacturers and wholesalers these products are sold under the liberty ®  brainerd ®  and other trademarks and the key competitors in north america include amerock top knobs richelieu and private label brands decorative bath hardware shower accessories and shower doors are sold under the brand names delta ®  and franklin brass ®  to wholesalers home center retailers mass retailers and other specialty retailers competitors for these products include moen kohler gatco and private label brands

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and the united kingdom includes several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors and in the united kingdom foreign manufacturers additional local and regional competitors may enter this industry as conditions improve in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection some of our north american competitors include american woodmark corporation fortune brands home  security inc and elkay 

the raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber plywood and particleboard and are available from multiple sources both domestic and foreign 

windows and other specialty products

additional information 

intellectual property 

we hold numerous us and foreign patents patent applications licenses trademarks trade names trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing processes as a manufacturer and distributor of brand name products we view our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important but do not believe that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our present business as a whole 

laws and regulations affecting our business 

we are subject to us and foreign government regulations particularly those pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers climate change and environmental issues our businesses are subject to requirements regarding protection of the environment and worker health and safety and have certain responsibilities for environmental remediation 

 compliance with these laws and regulations significantly affects product performance as well as our production costs we monitor applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment climate change and worker health and safety and incur ongoing expense relating to compliance we do not expect compliance with the federal state and local regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to 

the protection of the environment and worker health and safety will result in material capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position or results of operations and financial position

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business results of operations and financial position 

our business relies on home improvement and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity both of which are cyclical 

our business relies on home improvement activity including repair and remodeling projects and to a lesser extent on new home construction activity macroeconomic conditions in north america and europe including consumer confidence levels fluctuations in home prices unemployment and underemployment levels consumer income and debt levels household formation and the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for such loans affect both consumers’ discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity although credit availability has improved and financing rates remain low consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects and new home construction continues to be below historic levels the fundamentals driving our business are cyclical and adverse changes or uncertainty regarding macroeconomic conditions including an economic slowdown or increased interest rates could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

if we do not maintain our strong brands develop new products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences we could lose market share 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products while we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness these initiatives may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if we do not introduce new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance we could lose market share which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position it is also possible that our competitors may improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do which could adversely affect our market share 

in recent years consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers’ business models and strategies have changed as our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure including maintaining robust and userfriendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and to provide comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development if we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers our brands may lose market share 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

we face significant competition 

our products face significant competition we believe that brand reputation is an important factor impacting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features and innovation product quality customer service warranty and price we sell many of our products through home center retailers distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers our success with our customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery in addition home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly marketing directly to professional contractors and installers which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

we also compete with low‑cost foreign manufacturers and private label brands in a variety of our product groups as market dynamics change we may experience a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more value‑priced or opening price point products which may impact our ability to maintain or gain market share andor our profitability 

if we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers 

our sales are concentrated with our two largest customers in 2016 our net sales to the home depot were 25 billion approximately 34 percent of our consolidated net sales and our net sales to lowe’s were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales our reliance on these significant customers may further increase if the mix of our business operations changes including as a result of acquisitions or divestitures these home center retailers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them additionally these home center retailers may reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us although other retailers dealers distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services we might not be able to quickly replace if at all the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to lowe’s and any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

further as these home center retailers expand their markets and targeted customers and as consumer purchasing practices change and e‑commerce increases conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur which could impact our results of operations and financial position our relationships with these customers may be impacted if we increase the amount of business we transact directly with consumers in addition these home center retailers request product exclusivity from time to time which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives of investing in our brands developing innovative products and focusing on operational excellence through our continued deployment of the masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity all of these initiatives are designed to grow revenue improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid‑ to long‑term our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute them in a timely and efficient manner we could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization   

pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions at acceptable terms and prices our long‑term competitive positioning may be impacted even if we are successful in acquiring businesses we may experience risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business such risks include difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale diversion of our resources unforeseen liabilities issues with the new or existing customers or suppliers and difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses future foreign acquisitions may also increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs andor fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

our actions to improve the results of our us window business may not be successful 

our us window business milgard manufacturing incorporated “milgard” is experiencing operational issues and production inefficiencies including difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified labor in addition milgard has begun a phased deployment of a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system to improve its business processes the implementation of this erp system is complex and expensive and will require significant oversight and resources while we have implemented plans to address the operational and erp issues challenging milgard there is no assurance that our plans will be successful if we experience unanticipated expenses or additional disruptions to milgard’s operations our results of operations and financial position may be negatively impacted 

variability in commodity costs or limited availability of commodities could impact us 

we buy various commodities to produce our products including among others brass resins titanium dioxide zinc wood and glass in addition water is a significant component of many of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to produce our products our production of products could also be impacted if we are unable to procure our requirements for these commodities or if a shortage of these commodities drives their prices to levels that are not commercially feasible further increases in energy costs could increase our production and transportation costs which could also negatively affect our results of operations and financial position 

it can be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices such reductions could impact our results of operations and financial position 

we have entered into longterm agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of key commodities and to establish firm pricing but at times these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract from time to time we also may use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which has and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers 

we rely heavily on third‑party suppliers for many of our products and components and our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate andor timely supply of these products and components failure of our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant costs accordingly the loss of critical suppliers or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

many of the suppliers upon whom we rely are located in foreign countries the differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements and laws and regulations together with the limited number of suppliers have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain or if there is a disruption in transporting the products or components our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

there are risks associated with international operations and global strategies 

approximately 21  percent of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar in addition to our european operations we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties globally risks associated with our international operations include changes in political monetary and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments social and political unrest terrorist attacks cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 

our results of operations and financial position are also impacted by international economic conditions primarily in europe we continue to be negatively impacted by currency conversion rates particularly the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar and the chinese yuan renminbi due to the strength of the us dollar compared to these currencies fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

as the situation involving the united kingdom’s decision to exit from the european union develops we could experience volatility in the currency exchange rates andor a change in the demand for our products and services particularly in our uk and european markets or there could be disruption of our operations and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses 

us laws and regulations regarding activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws laws regulating competition anti‑briberyanti‑corruption and other business practices and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs can also affect us while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative impact on our international tax structure it is possible that significant changes in how us and foreign jurisdictions tax cross‑border transactions could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 

we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us current and former employees contractors or suppliers have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by or disclosed to others including our competitors protecting and defending our intellectual property could be costly time consuming and require significant resources if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could affect our results of operations and financial position 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them in certain areas of the us we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty in recruiting training and retaining sufficient skilled and unskilled labor resulting in additional costs related to labor inefficiencies the failure to attract and retain key employees or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess could negatively affect our competitive position and our results of operations and financial position 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are involved in various claims and litigation including class actions and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have a material adverse effect on us the types of matters may include among others competition product liability employment warranty advertising contract personal injury and environmental given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter defending and resolving claims and litigation can be costly and can divert management’s attention we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of claims and litigation 

we are also subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant costs and regardless of the ultimate outcome create adverse publicity and damage the reputation of our brands and business also we rely on other manufacturers to provide products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products and components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of the risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial position 

refer to note u to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

compliance with laws government regulation and industry standards could impact our results of operations and financial position 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign government laws and regulations including securities laws tax laws antibriberyanticorruption laws and employment laws as well as those pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers product compliance competition practices import and export regulations climate change and environmental issues in addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with these laws regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs our manufacturing processes our packaging or our sourcing compliance activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

we rely on information systems and technology and disruptions to these systems could impact our results of operations and financial position 

we rely on a number of information systems and technology to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities we may be adversely impacted if our information systems are disrupted are no longer supported or fail in addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our systems increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems we have established security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations despite these efforts our systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access malicious software undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption exposure of proprietary or confidential information data corruption damage to our reputation exposure to litigation and increased operational costs such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation 

we have plans to make significant investments in new technology systems throughout our company over the next several years we are also in the process of implementing erp systems at select business units while we are leveraging our experience and engaging consultants to assist as we deploy erp systems we have experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated expenses and disruptions to our operations during these implementations our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted if we do not appropriately select and implement our new technology systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation of erp systems 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility 

we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement and in order to borrow under it we cannot be in default with any of those provisions our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be impacted if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants in the past we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement our financial flexibility would be restricted if we were also unable to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms and at acceptable rates or if we were not permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 

  the topbuild spin off could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spin off of topbuild corp topbuild in 2015 and certain related transactions qualify for tax‑free treatment under certain sections of the internal revenue code however if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect including those relating 

to the past and future conduct of our business we will not be able to rely on the opinion furthermore the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinion the spin off transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spin off transaction is taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of topbuild in connection with the spin off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received thereby potentially increasing such holder’s tax liability 

even if the spin off otherwise qualifies as a tax‑free transaction the distribution could be taxable to us but not to our stockholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of topbuild are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin off in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spin off we entered into a tax matters agreement with topbuild pursuant to which topbuild agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spin off to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction these obligations and potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us

tableend the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as believe anticipate appear may will should intend plan estimate expect assume seek forecast and similar references to future periods our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements 

in addition to the various factors included in the executive level overview critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections our future performance may be affected by the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce new and improved products our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries our reliance on key customers our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives our ability to improve our underperforming us window business the cost and availability of raw materials our dependence on third party suppliers and risks associated with international operations and global strategies these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a risk factors of this report any forwardlooking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it was made factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

executive level overview 

we design manufacture and distribute branded home improvement and building products these products are sold for home improvement and new home construction through home center retailers mass merchandisers hardware stores homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer 

2016  results 

net sales were positively affected by increased sales volume resulting from increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction and favorable product mix in the us and europe such increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger us dollar compared to the british pound and euro and net selling price decreases in north america our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs operational efficiencies and cost savings initiatives such increases were partially offset by an increase in warranty costs resulting from a change in our estimate of expected future warranty claim costs and an increase in certain variable expenses such as strategic growth investments as well as erp system implementation and higher insurance costs 

our plumbing products segment benefited from increased sales volume a favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and benefits associated with cost savings initiatives and was negatively impacted by an increase in certain variable expenses such as strategic growth investments and higher insurance costs as well as unfavorable product mix the decorative architectural products segment benefited from increased sales volume of paints and other coating products and builders hardware partially offset by an unfavorable relationship betwen selling prices and commodity costs of paints and other coating products our cabinetry products segment benefited from operational efficiencies resulting from business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives a positive product mix and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and was negatively impacted by decreased sales volume our windows and other specialty products segment was negatively affected by increased warranty costs and certain other expenses such as higher labor costs and erp system implementation costs and was positively impacted by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of windows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and 

liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

note a to the consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments allowances are estimated based upon specific customer balances where a risk of default has been identified and also include a provision for noncustomer specific defaults based upon historical collection return and writeoff activity 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by gaap 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and currently a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated repair and remodel activity and estimated housing starts our assumptions included a relatively stable us gross domestic product growing at 23 percent and a euro zone gross domestic product growing at 14 percent annually over the fiveyear forecast 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 85 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital is unchanged as compared to 2015  in 2016  based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 105 percent to 135 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2016  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any reporting unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 2016  we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets 

employee retirement plans 

we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic and foreign qualified and domestic nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans several years ago 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2016  our discount rate decreased for obligations to an average of 35 percent from 40 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2016  towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 15 percent to 40 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 38 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets based upon an analysis of expected and historical rates of return of various asset classes utilizing the current and longterm asset allocation of the plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 338 million  at december 31 2016  from 401 million  at december 31 2015  our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 170 million  at december 31 2016  compared with 174 million  at december 31 2015  these unfunded plans are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 76 percent to 109 percent 

the decrease in our projected benefit obligations was partially driven by lump sum payouts of certain longterm qualified pension obligations as well as a change to the mp 2016 mortality improvement scale which decreased our longterm pension liabilities the decrease was partially offset by a lower discount rate compared to the prior year during 2016  we contributed 100 million to our qualified definedbenefit pension plans including 51 million to a previously unfunded pension plan additionally our qualified definedbenefit pension plan assets had a net gain of 83 percent in 2016  refer to note m to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 22 million in 2017  compared with 25 million in 2016  if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2017 pension expense would increase by 4 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 8 million in 2017  compared to 9 million in 2016  

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 21 million in 2017  to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans refer to note m to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the funding of our plans 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

in the third quarter of 2014  we recorded a 517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our us federal and certain state deferred tax assets due primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our us operations in reaching this conclusion we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and remodel activity in the us and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our us operations over the past few years in the fourth quarter of 2014  we recorded an additional 12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain uk and mexican deferred tax assets primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions 

we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2016  should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

the potential for comprehensive tax reform in 2017 if implemented may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate or taxes paid due to certain business provisions such as the denial of net interest expense deductions or the imposition of a tax on imports 

warranty 

we offer full and limited warranties on certain products with warranty periods ranging up to the lifetime of the product to the original consumer purchaser at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated future cost to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of future costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage the warranty period historical experience specific to the nature frequency and average cost to service the claim along with industry and demographic trends 

certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals refer to note u to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

a significant portion of our business is at the consumer retail level through home center retailers and other major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 

litigation 

we are subject to claims charges litigation and other proceedings in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure in these matters meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments 

corporate development strategy 

we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing core businesses and complementing our existing business with smaller strategic acquisitions particularly in the plumbing products and decorative architectural products segment longerterm we may seek larger strategic acquisitions as our company continues to grow 

in addition we actively manage our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that do not align with our longterm growth strategy we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies 

our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 104 percent and 98 percent at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively refer to note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on march 17 2016  we issued 400 million of 35  notes due april 1 2021 and 500 million of 4375  notes due april 1 2026 we received proceeds of 896 million net of discount for the issuance of these notes the notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option at the applicable redemption price on april 15 2016 proceeds from the debt issuances together with cash on hand were used to repay and early retire all of our 1 billion  6125  notes which were due on october 3 2016 and all of our 300 million  585  notes which were due on march 15 2017 in connection with these early retirements we incurred 40 million of debt extinguishment costs which we recorded as interest expense 

on june 15 2015 we repaid and retired all of our 500 million 48 notes on the scheduled retirement date 

on march 24 2015 we issued 500 million of 445 notes due april 1 2025 these notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option 

on march 28 2013 we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion and a maturity date of march 28 2018 on may 29 2015 and august 28 2015 we amended the credit agreement with the bank group the amended credit agreement the amended credit agreement reduces the aggregate commitment to 750 million and extends the maturity date to may 29 2020 under the amended credit agreement at our request and subject to certain conditions we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional 375 million with the current bank group or new lenders refer to note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the amended credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a a maximum net leverage ratio as adjusted for certain items of 40 to 10 and b a minimum interest coverage ratio as adjusted for certain items equal to or greater than 25 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under our amended credit agreement at december 31 2016  we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants through at least the next year 

we had cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits of approximately 12 billion at december 31 2016  our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts time deposit accounts and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments our shortterm bank deposits consist of time deposits with maturities of 12 months or less 

of the 12 billion and 17 billion of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits we held at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 618 million and 630 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us would not result in significant additional us income tax or foreign withholding tax as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro british pound and the us dollar commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis beginning in 2016 we decided to significantly reduce our utilization of derivative and hedging activity for commodity cost fluctuations by settling positions at their scheduled maturity while not entering into new transactions 

in the third quarter of 2016 we increased our quarterly dividend to 10 per common share from 095 per common share during 2016 we repurchased nearly 15 million shares of our common stock for cash aggregating 459 million 

our current ratio was 20 to 1 and 14 to 1 at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in the current ratio was due to the net debt reduction of 400 million during 2016 resulting from the refinancing of our debt which reduced current liabilities by approximately 1 billion at december 31 2016  compared to december 31 2015  

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



our working capital days were as follows 



net cash provided by operations of 726 million  consisted primarily of net income adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 134 million  deferred income taxes of 130 million  and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays partially offset by changes in working capital and contributions to our definedbenefit pension plans 

net cash used for financing activities was 1046 million  primarily due to the early retirement of all of our 1 billion 6125 notes which were due october 3 2016 and all of our 300 million 585 notes which were due march 15 2017 459 million  for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value and includes 11 million shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2016 128 million  for cash dividends paid 40 million  for debt extinguishment costs and 31 million  for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest this usage was partially offset by the issuance of 400 million of 35 notes due april 1 2021 and 500 million of 4375 notes due april 1 2026 

in september 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise replacing the previous board of directors authorization established in 2007 at december 31 2016  we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 129 million  shares of our common stock consistent with past practice and as part of our strategic initiative we expect to repurchase the remainder of these shares in 2017  the timing of these share repurchases will depend on market conditions some of these shares will be purchased to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted as part of our compensation programs 

net cash used for investing activities was 124 million  and included 180 million  for capital expenditures partially offset by 40 million  net proceeds from the sale of shortterm bank deposits and 32 million  cash receive d from financial investments primarily related to the early redemption of our auction rate securities 

we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2016  were 180 million  compared with 158 million  for 2015  and 128 million  for 2014  for 2017  capital expenditures excluding any potential 2017  acquisitions are expected to be approximately 200 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2016  totaled 134 million  compared with 133 million  for 2015  and 167 million  for 2014  for 2017  depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2017  acquisitions is expected to be approximately 130 million amortization expense totaled 10 million 11 million and 10 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results under gaap 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2016  were 74 billion  which increased three percent compared with 2015  excluding acquisitions and the unfavorable effect of currency translation net sales increased four percent compared to 2015  the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 



net sales for 2016  were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products paints and other coating products and builders hardware which in aggregate increased sales by approximately five percent compared to 2015  net sales for 2016  were also positively affected by favorable product mix of cabinets and windows and net selling price increases of north american windows and north american and international plumbing products which in aggregate increased sales approximately one percent net sales for 2016  were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets and lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products which in aggregate decreased sales by approximately two percent 

net sales for 2015  were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products paints and other coating products windows and builders hardware which in aggregate increased sales by approximately four percent compared to 2014  net sales for 2015  were also positively affected by net selling price increases of plumbing products cabinets and windows which in aggregate increased sales approximately one percent product mix of north american cabinets and windows also positively affected 2015  net sales net sales for 2015  were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets and lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products 

net sales for 2014  were positively affected by increased sales volume of north american plumbing products paints and other coating products builders hardware and north american windows net sales for 2014  were also positively affected by net selling prices for cabinets international plumbing products and windows net sales for 2014  were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets and by lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products 

our gross profit margins were 334 percent 315 percent and 294 percent in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the 2016  and 2015  gross profit margins were positively affected by increased sales volume a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalization and other cost savings initiatives 2016 gross profit margins were negatively impacted by an increase in warranty costs resulting from a change in our estimate of expected future warranty claim costs 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 191 percent in 2016  compared with 187 percent in 2015  and 192 percent in 2014  selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2016  reflect certain variable expenses such as strategic growth investments as well as erp system implementation and higher insurance costs selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2015 reflect increased sales and the effect of cost containment measures 

the following table reconciles reported operating profit to operating profit as adjusted to exclude certain items dollars in millions 



operating profit margins in 2016  and 2015  were positively affected by increased sales volume a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit margin in 2016 was negatively impacted by an increase in warranty costs resulting from a change in expected future warranty claim costs and certain variable expenses such as strategic growth investments as well as erp system implementation and higher insurance costs operating profit in 2015 was negatively affected by foreign currency translation 

other income expense net 

other net for 2016  included net gains of 5 million  from distributions from private equity funds 3 million  from the redemption of auction rate securities and 2 million  of earnings from equity investments other net for 2016   also included losses from the disposition of other investments of 3 million  realized foreign currency losses of 3 million and other miscellaneous items 

other net for 2015  included net gains of 6 million  from distributions from private equity funds and 2 million  of earnings from equity investments other net for 2015  also included realized foreign currency losses of 14 million  and other miscellaneous items 

other net for 2014  included net gains of 4 million  from distributions from private equity funds and realized foreign currency gains of 5 million  and other miscellaneous items income from financial investments net for 2014  included losses from equity investments net of 2 million 

interest expense was 229 million  in 2016  and 225 million  in 2015  and 2014  interest expense increased in 2016 due primarily to the 40 million of additional interest expense in connection with the early retirement of debt partially offset by the interest savings due to the discharge of indebtedness 

income and earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to masco corporation 

income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2016  were 491 million  and 147  per common share respectively income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2015  were 357 million  and 103  per common share respectively income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2014  were 821 million  and 228  per common share respectively 

our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 36 percent tax expense 43 percent tax expense and 71 percent tax benefit in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the 2016 effective tax rate includes a 14 million charge to tax expense from the elimination of a disproportionate tax effect resulting from our auction rate securities being called by our counterparty during 2016 this charge was offset by a 13 million tax benefit from the recognition of a deferred tax asset on certain german net operating losses primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability refer to note s to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

compared to our normalized tax rate of 36 percent the variance in 2015  is due primarily to a 21 million valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets of topbuild recorded as a noncash charge to income tax expense the topbuild deferred tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off topbuild into a separate company that on a standalone basis as of june 30 2015 the spin off date was unlikely to be able to realize the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses 

the 2015  effective tax rate also includes a 19 million charge to income tax expense to recognize the required taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted this charge was 

the result of our determination that we may need to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested in order to provide greater flexibility in the execution of our capital management strategy 

the variance from our normalized tax rate in 2014  is due primarily to changes in the us federal valuation allowance and reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions 

outlook for the company 

we continue to successfully execute against our longterm growth strategies by leveraging our brand portfolio industryleading positions and masco operating system our methodology to drive growth and productivity we believe we will continue to see strong demand for our marketleading products as the fundamentals for longterm demand in both repair and remodel and new home construction continue to be positive we believe that our strong financial position together with our current strategy of investing in our industryleading branded building products our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation will allow us to drive longterm growth and create value for our shareholders

we continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalizations and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations although we do not anticipate that the costs and charges related to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will be as significant as they have been in prior years 

during 2016  our plumbing products segment incurred costs of 13 million  primarily related to plant closure costs in canada and at our international operations as well as severance costs across multiple businesses our cabinetry products segment continued to incur costs and charges of 8 million  primarily related to cost savings initiatives in north america lastly our windows and other specialty products segment incurred costs of 1 million related to severance at our us windows business

plumbing products 

sales

net sales in this segment increased one percent in 2015 compared to 2014 net sales increased primarily due to increased sales volume of both north american and international operations which increased sales by five percent and net selling price increases primarily related to international operations which increased sales by two percent an acquisition also positively impacted sales by one percent compared to 2014 foreign currency translation reduced sales by seven percent compared to 2014 primarily due to the stronger us dollar excluding the impact of foreign currency translation segment sales increased by eight percent in 2015 compared to 2014 

net sales in this segment increased in 2014 primarily due to increased sales volume of both north american and international operations this segment was also positively affected by increased net selling prices of international plumbing products 

operating results 

operating margins in the plumbing products segment in 2016 were positively impacted by increased sales volume a favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs including the positive impact of the metal hedge contracts and the benefits associated with business rationalization and other cost savings initiatives such increases were partially offset by an increase in certain variable expenses such as strategic growth investments and higher insurance costs as well as unfavorable product mix 

operating margins in this segment in 2015 were negatively impacted by unfavorable product mix as well as an increase in certain variable expenses such as trade show and marketing expenses and legalrelated expenses such decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume and a favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs including the negative impact of the metal hedge contracts although operating margins were not 

significantly impacted foreign currency translation primarily due to a stronger us dollar negatively impacted operating profit by six percent compared to 2014 

operating margins in this segment in 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs including the positive impact of the metal hedge contracts lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives

net sales of decorative architectural products increased four percent in 2016 compared to 2015 net sales increased primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and other coating products related to our behr pro ®  business and corediy products as well as builders hardware such increases were partially offset by lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products 

net sales in this segment increased in 2015 primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and other coating products related to the expansion of the behr pro business and increased sales volume of builders hardware such increases were partially offset by lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products and an unfavorable currency impact of canadian paints and other coating products sales 

net sales in this segment increased in 2014 primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and other coating products related to new product introductions and other growth initiatives and increased sales volume of builders hardware partially offset by lower net selling prices of paints and other coating products 

operating results 

operating margins in the decorative architectural products segment reflect increased sales volume of paints and other coating products and builders hardware partially offset by an unfavorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of paints and other coating products 

operating margins in this segment in 2015 reflect operational efficiencies due to benefits associated with cost savings initiatives a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and increased sales volume of paints and other coating products and builders hardware such increases were partially offset by an increase in advertising and display expenses operating margins were also negatively impacted by unfavorable currency effects from our canadian operating results due to the stronger us dollar in 2015 

operating margins in this segment in 2014 reflect a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs a less favorable product mix of paints and other coating products and costs for new product introductions and advertising such decreases more than offset the benefits associated with cost savings initiatives 

cabinetry products 

sales 

net sales of cabinetry products decreased five percent in 2016 compared to 2015 net sales decreased primarily due to lower sales volume of cabinets resulting from our deliberate exit of certain lower margin business in the directtobuilder channel in the us and other accounts in the uk which in aggregate decreased sales by 10 percent compared to 2015 and a stronger us dollar which decreased sales by one percent compared to 2015 such decreases were partially offset by a favorable product mix of north american and international cabinets and net selling price increases of north american cabinets which in aggregate increased sales by six percent compared to 2015 

net sales in this segment increased three percent in 2015 compared to 2014 net sales increased primarily due to a favorable product mix and net selling price increases of north american and international cabinets which in aggregate increased sales by six percent compared to 2014 net sales decreased due to decreased sales volumes in both north america and international cabinets which on a combined basis decreased sales by three percent compared to 2014 

net sales in this segment in 2014 decreased primarily due to lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix of north american operations such decreases were partially offset by increased net selling prices in north america and increased sales volume and a more favorable product mix of international cabinets 

operating results 

operating margins in the cabinetry products segment in 2016 were positively affected by operational efficiencies due to the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives a favorable product mix and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs primarily at our north american cabinets business this increase was partially offset by decreased sales volume in north american and international cabinets 

operating margins in this segment in 2015 were positively affected by operational efficiencies due to the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives and decreased business rationalization expenses operating margins were also positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and a favorable product mix 

operating margins in this segment in 2014 were negatively affected by lower north american sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs as well as increased business rationalization expenses operating margins were also negatively affected by a less favorable product mix such declines more than offset a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalization activities and other cost savings initiatives 

windows and other specialty products 

sales

operating results 

operating margins in the windows and other specialty products segment decreased in 2016 due to an increase in warranty costs primarily resulting from a change in our estimate of future warranty claim costs as well as increases in certain other expenses such as higher labor costs and erp system implementation costs at our north american windows business such costs were partially offset by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of us windows 

operating margins in this segment in 2015 reflect higher sales volume and favorable product mix of windows in the western us and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of windows in the us and uk such increases were partially offset by an increase in certain expenses such as advertising and erp system implementation costs in 2015 

operating margins in this segment in 2014 reflect a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs a more favorable product mix of us and uk windows and increased sales volume in the western us such positive results were partially offset by lower sales volume and lower net selling prices of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools

 item 1 business 

masco corporation is a global leader in the design manufacture marketing and distribution of branded home improvement and building products our portfolio of industryleading brands includes kraftmaid® and merillat® cabinets delta® peerless® and hansgrohe® faucets bath and shower fixtures hot spring® and caldera® spas behr® paint primer and stain kilz® primer liberty® and brainerd® decorative hardware and milgard® windows and doors we leverage our powerful brands across product categories sales channels and geographies to create value for our customers and shareholders 

during 2015 we further advanced our strategy to position the company for future growth by focusing on three strategic pillars driving the full potential of our core businesses leveraging opportunities across our businesses and actively managing our portfolio we achieved gains in each of these areas 

first to drive the full potential of our core businesses we pursued sales growth opportunities in adjacent markets and products continued the deployment of standardized operating tools across the enterprise executed cost saving initiatives and expanded our implementation of lean principles and process improvements in many areas including production and functional support processes 

we also continued to leverage the collective strength of our enterprise the second pillar of our strategy we provided new assignments to selected leaders across our business units to further develop talent and facilitate operational improvements we continued to realize supply chain efficiencies through strategic sourcing and we continued to share best practices across all of our functional departments to enhance productivity as a result our operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency translation improved across all of our segments particularly at our us cabinets business 

the third pillar of our strategy is to actively manage our portfolio on june 30 2015 we completed the spin off of our installation and other services businesses into an independent publiclytraded company topbuild corp through a taxfree distribution to our shareholders as a result of the spin off our business has become less dependent on new home construction and is therefore less cyclical and a greater portion of our sales are derived from international markets in addition we acquired two businesses in 2015 that complement our existing portfolio first we expanded our product offering and distribution channels into the aquatic fitness category with the acquisition of the endless pools® brand we also acquired evolution manufacturing which expands our offering of fiberglass and composite windows in the united kingdom to further enhance value creation for our shareholders during 2015 we repurchased over 17 million shares of our common stock and increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 6 percent 

we believe that the actions we took during 2015 have positioned our company for further enhancement of shareholder value we also believe that completion of the spin off allows us to pursue a more focused strategy of growth we will continue to actively manage our portfolio identify growth opportunities in key industries and produce new products that differentiate us in the marketplace by combining design and innovation by continuing our disciplined execution of our strategy we believe that we will increase shareholder value 

our business segments 

we report our financial results in four business segments aggregated by similarity in products and services the following table sets forth the contribution of our segments to net sales and operating profit loss for the three years ended december 31 2015 additional financial information concerning our operations by segment and by geographic regions as well as general corporate expense net as of and 

for the three years ended december 31 2015 is set forth in note p to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 



  



1 amounts exclude discontinued operations 2 operating profit loss is before general corporate expense net 3 operating profit loss is before income of 9 million regarding the 2014 litigation settlement in the decorative architectural products segment 

all of our operating segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for repair and remodel activity and new home construction 

cabinets and related products 

in north america we manufacture and sell valuepriced stock and semicustom assembled cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points to address consumer preferences our product offerings in this segment also include the fabrication and sale of integrated bathroom vanity and countertop products in the united kingdom we manufacture and sell kitchen bath and storage cabinetry our kraftmaid® brand is sold primarily to dealers and home center retailers and our merillat® quality cabinets™ moores™ and cardell® brands are sold primarily to dealers and homebuilders for both home improvement and new home construction cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both retail consumers spending and new home construction particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects a significant portion of our sales for home improvement are made through home center retailers 

our cabinets and related products segment was particularly affected by the economic downturn and decline in new home construction and repair and remodel activity that began in 2008 consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects is improving including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects but continues to be below normal levels which impacts our profitability home construction is also improving and is expected to continue to improve demand has increased for multifamily housing units which are generally smaller and require fewer kitchen and bathroom cabinets than singlefamily housing units our initiatives to improve this segment have been complex timeconsuming and expensive although the operating results of our cabinetry businesses improved in 2015 we continue to 

focus on obtaining profitable sales reducing our cost structure and improving cabinet production efficiencies we are pursuing strategies to increase sales through new product introductions and enhanced customer service and to rationalize a portion of our customer base in our builder channel to focus on opportunities that offer more profitable growth 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and the united kingdom includes several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors and in the united kingdom foreign manufacturers in recent years we have experienced significant competition in the form of new product offerings by our competitors which have impacted the segments results of operations additional local and regional competitors may enter this industry as conditions improve in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection some of our north american competitors include american woodmark corporation fortune brands home  security inc and elkay 

the raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber plywood and particleboard and are available from multiple sources both domestic and foreign 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us the majority of our faucet bathing and showering devices are sold in north america and europe under the brand names delta® peerless® hansgrohe® axor® brizo® ginger® newport brass® brasstech® and plumb shop® our bristan™ and heritage™ products are principally sold in the united kingdom these plumbing products include faucets showerheads handheld showers valves bathing units shower enclosures and toilets and are sold to home center retailers and to wholesalers and distributors that in turn sell them to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and consumers

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe our major competitors include lixil group corporations american standard brands and grohe products kohler co fortune brands home  security inc and spectrum brands holdings llcs pfister faucets we also experience competition from foreign manufacturers including grohe particularly in germany china and the middle east we face significant competition from private label products many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price the businesses in our plumbing products segment manufacture products in the united states europe and asia and source products from asia and other regions in addition to price we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer 

selection competition for our plumbing products is based largely on service product quality product innovation and features and breadth of product offering 

many of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have multiple sources both domestic and foreign for the raw materials used in this segment and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc therefore we have implemented a hedging strategy to help reduce the impact of this volatility 

decorative architectural products 

we produce architectural coatings including paints primers specialty paint products stains and waterproofing products these products are sold in north america china and south america under the brand names behr® behr pro® and kilz® to doityourself and professional customers through home center retailers and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 25 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 our behr products are sold through the home depot our largest customer and this segments largest customer the loss of this segments sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segments business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

our competitors include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic ppg sherwinwilliams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection and that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality technology and product innovation and customer service in 2015 we introduced a new behr® color solutions® center designed to enhance the color selection process and overall shopping experience in all north american the home depot stores 

fluctuations in raw material costs can have a material impact on our operating results in this segment titanium dioxide and acrylic resins derived from crude oil and natural gas are used in the manufacturing of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas can adversely affect this segments results of operations global supply and demand dynamics and production capacity limitations can cause fluctuations in the price of titanium dioxide and acrylic resins which can impact our results we have agreements with the significant suppliers of the major raw materials used in this segment which are intended to help assure continued availability

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity both of which are cyclical 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodeling projects of which our reliance has increased following the spin off of topbuild corp topbuild in 2015 our business also relies on new home construction activity macroeconomic conditions in the us and europe including consumer confidence levels fluctuations in home prices unemployment and underemployment levels consumer income and debt levels household formation and the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for such loans affect both consumers discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity while improving both consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects and new home construction continue to be below historic average levels adverse changes or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction both of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position 

if we do not maintain strong brands develop new products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences we could lose market share 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products while we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness these initiatives may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if we do not introduce new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance we could lose market share which could negatively impact our operating results 

in recent years consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers business models and strategies have changed consumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and to inform and provide feedback on their purchasing and ownership experience for these products ebusiness is a rapidly developing area and the refinement and execution of a successful ebusiness strategy involves significant time investment and resources if we are unable to successfully execute our ebusiness strategy our brands may lose market share 

while us demand for singlefamily houses is increasing the demand for multifamily housing units such as apartments and condominiums continues to be elevated compared to historic levels multifamily units typically are smaller than singlefamily houses and require fewer kitchen and bathroom cabinets than singlefamily houses if this demand mix remains it may limit our growth opportunities 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

we face significant competition 

our products face significant competition we believe that brand reputation is an important factor impacting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features and innovation product quality customer service warranty and price home center retailers continue to purchase products in our segments directly from lowcost foreign manufacturers for sale as private label merchandise additionally home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly marketing directly to professional contractors and installers which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

we sell many of our products through distributors and independent dealers and we rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers our success with these customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery additionally in these channels as well as at home center retailers we compete with foreign manufacturers in a variety of our product groups some of these foreign manufacturers are putting downward pressures on price as market dynamics change we may experience a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more valuepriced or opening price point products which may impact our ability to maintain or gain market share andor our profitability 

our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries depends upon maintaining strong brands developing and innovating products maintaining strong relationships with our customers managing our cost structure executing a successful ebusiness strategy accommodating customer demands for new and improved products on a shorter cycle implementing growth strategies and entering new domestic and international areas none of which is assured 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers 

as a result of the spin off of topbuild in 2015 the mix of our business operations has changed and the concentration of our sales to our two largest customers has increased and may continue to increase in 2015 net sales to our largest customer the home depot were 24 billion approximately 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015 net sales to lowes our second largest customer were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales if the mix of our business operations continues to change including as a result of acquisitions or divestitures our reliance on these significant customers may further increase these home center retailers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them additionally these home center customers may reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases although other retailers dealers distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to lowes would have a material adverse effect on our business 

further as some of these home center retailers expand their markets and targeted customers and as consumer purchasing practices change and ecommerce increases conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur which could impact our results of operations our relationships with our customers may be impacted if we increase the amount of business we transact directly with consumers in addition our large retail customers request product exclusivity from time to time which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives 

we continue to pursue our strategic initiatives which are designed to increase shareholder value over the mid to longterm our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are 

unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute them in a timely and efficient manner we could also be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization 

pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions our longterm competitive positioning may be impacted even if we are successful in acquiring businesses we may experience risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business such risks include difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale diversion of our resources unforeseen liabilities issues with the new or existing customers or suppliers and difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses future foreign acquisitions may also increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs andor fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may not be able to sustain the turnaround in our cabinetry businesses 

our initiatives to improve our cabinetry operations have been complex timeconsuming and expensive although the operating results of our cabinetry businesses improved in 2015 we continue to focus on obtaining profitable sales reducing our cost structure and improving production efficiencies our strategies in these areas require time to implement execute and assess and may not be successful if the improvement in our cabinetry businesses cannot be sustained or if the pace of the improvement slows our results of operations may be negatively impacted 

variability in commodity costs or limited availability of commodities could impact us 

we buy various commodities to manufacture our products including among others brass resins titanium dioxide zinc wood and glass in addition water is a significant component of many of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to restrictions in certain regions fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products further increases in energy costs could increase our production costs as well as our transportation costs each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices such reductions could impact our operating results 

to help reduce price volatility associated with certain anticipated commodity purchases we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments to purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which has and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and operating results we also have agreements with certain significant suppliers to help assure continued availability 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers 

we rely heavily on thirdparty suppliers for many of our products and components and our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of these products and components failure by our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant costs accordingly the loss of critical suppliers or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operating results 

many of the suppliers upon whom we rely are located in foreign countries the differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements and laws and regulations together with the limited number of suppliers have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain our operating results could be negatively affected 

there are risks associated with international operations and global strategies 

approximately 21 percent of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar following the topbuild spin off a greater proportion of our sales occurs outside of the us and increasing our international sales is an important part of our strategic plans in addition to our european operations we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties globally risks associated with our international operations include changes in political monetary and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments social and political unrest terrorist attacks cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 

our operating results are also impacted by international economic conditions primarily in europe as our sales made outside of the us have increased we have experienced a greater negative impact from currency conversion rates particularly the euro the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling on our results of operations due to the strength of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

us laws and regulations regarding activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws laws regulating competition antibriberyanticorruption and other business practices and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs can also affect us while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative impact on our international tax structure it is possible that significant changes in how us and foreign jurisdictions tax crossborder transactions could adversely impact our financial results 

we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our growth and innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us protecting and defending our intellectual property could be costly time consuming and require significant resources if we are not able to protect our existing 

intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could affect our results of operations 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract and retain key employees or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results if we are unable to recruit train and retain sufficient skilled and unskilled labor we may not be able to adequately satisfy increased demand for our products and services and our operating results could be adversely affected 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are involved in various claims litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us these matters may include competition products liability employment warranty disputes advertising claims contract disputes personal injury claims environmental claims or proceedings and other proceedings and litigation including class actions 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can damage the reputation of our brands and business and can be costly to defend or manage also we rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously however given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter in recent years we have experienced class action lawsuits predicated upon claims for product liability and wage and hour issues and we may be subject to other consumer claims in the future we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases due to their scope and complexity however these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend and resolve and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations we may also experience increased costs for insurance coverage that could impact our financial results 

see note u to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

compliance with laws government regulation and industry standards could impact our operating results 

we are subject to federal state and foreign government regulations particularly those pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers product compliance competition practices import and export regulations climate disruption and environmental issues in addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with these laws regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs our manufacturing processes or our sourcing further compliance activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our results of operations could be negatively affected 

we rely on information systems and technology and disruptions to these systems could impact our operating results 

we rely on a number of information systems and technology to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities and we have plans to make significant investments in new technology systems we may be adversely impacted if our information systems are disrupted or fail or if we do not appropriately select and implement our new technology systems in a timely manner in addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our systems increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems we have established security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations despite these efforts our systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access malicious software undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption exposure of proprietary or confidential information data corruption damage to our reputation exposure to litigation and increased operational costs such events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation 

restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility 

we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement and in order to borrow under it we cannot be in default with any of those provisions our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be impacted if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants in the past we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement our financial flexibility would be restricted if we were also unable to obtain alternative financing on acceptable terms and at acceptable rates or if we were not permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 

the topbuild spin off could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spin off and certain related transactions qualify for taxfree treatment under certain sections of the internal revenue code however if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect including 

those relating to the past and future conduct of our business we will not be able to rely on the opinion furthermore the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinion the spin off transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spin off transaction is taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of topbuild in connection with the spin off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received thereby potentially increasing such holders tax liability 

even if the spin off otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution could be taxable to us but not to our stockholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of topbuild are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin off in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spin off we entered into a tax matters agreement with topbuild pursuant to which topbuild agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spin off to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction these obligations and potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements that reflect our views about our future performance and constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as believe anticipate appear may will should intend plan estimate expect assume seek forecast and similar references to future periods our views about future performance involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in our forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements 

in addition to the various factors included in the executive level overview critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections our future performance may be affected by the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce new and improved products our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries our reliance on key customers our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives our ability to sustain the performance of our cabinetry businesses the cost and availability of raw materials our dependence on third party suppliers and risks associated with international operations and global strategies these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a risk factors of this report any forwardlooking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it was made factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

executive level overview 

we design manufacture market and distribute branded home improvement and building products these products are sold for home improvement and new home construction through home center retailers mass merchandisers hardware stores homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer 

2015 results 

net sales were positively affected by increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction in the us and europe favorable product mix net selling price increases and acquisitions such increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger us dollar compared to the euro our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume operational efficiencies due to benefits resulting from cost savings initiatives and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs 

our cabinets and related products segment was positively affected by operational efficiencies due to benefits resulting from business rationalization activities and other cost saving initiatives and decreased business rationalization expenses our plumbing products segment benefited from increased sales volume and a favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and was negatively impacted by unfavorable product mix and an increase in certain variable expenses the decorative architectural products segment benefited from increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders hardware a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs in 

paints and stains and operational efficiencies due to benefits associated with cost savings initiatives our other specialty products segment benefited from increased volume a more favorable product mix of us windows and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs of windows in the us and the uk 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

note a to our consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by gaap 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and currently a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales 

data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated repair and remodel activity and estimated housing starts our assumptions included a relatively stable us gross domestic product ranging from 24 percent to 29 percent and a euro zone gross domestic product ranging from 15 percent to 18 percent over the fiveyear forecast 

we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 85 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to less risk associated with our stock in relation to the capital markets in 2015 based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 105 percent to 125 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill 

a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2015 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any reporting unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 2015 we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets 

employee retirement plans 

effective january 1 2010 we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2015 our discount rate increased for obligations to an average of 40 percent from 38 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2015 towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 20 percent to 43 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 40 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 401 million at december 31 2015 from 454 million at december 31 2014 our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 174 million at december 31 2015 compared with 190 million at december 31 2014 

the decrease in the projected benefit obligations was primarily due to lower bond rates and a change to the mp 2015 mortality improvement scale issued by the us society of actuaries which decreased our longterm pension liabilities our qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2015 had a net loss of 18 percent 

at december 31 2015 we reported a net liability of 575 million of which 174 million was related to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plans which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 78 percent to 114 percent 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 24 million in 2016 compared with 22 million in 2015 if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2016 pension expense would increase by 5 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 9 million in 2016 compared to 10 million in 2015 

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 25 million in 2016 to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans refer to footnote m for further information regarding the funding of our plans 

income taxes 

deferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

in 2010 we recorded a 372 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position 

during 2012 and 2011 objective and verifiable negative evidence such as us operating losses and significant impairment charges for us goodwill and other intangible assets continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance as a result we recorded increases of 65 million and 87 million in the valuation allowance related to our us federal deferred tax assets in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in the third quarter of 2014 we recorded a 517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our us federal and certain state deferred tax assets due primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our us operations in reaching this conclusion we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and remodel activity in the us and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our us operations over the past few years 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded an additional 12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain uk and mexican deferred tax assets primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions 

we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2015 should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

warranty 

at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage the warranty period historical experience specific to the nature frequency and average cost to service the claim along with industry and demographic trends 

certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals 

a significant portion of our business is at the consumer retail level through home center retailers and other major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 

litigation 

we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance 

amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments 

corporate development strategy 

we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing core businesses and complementing our existing business with smaller strategic acquisitions we acquired two businesses in 2015 endless pools and evolution manufacturing endless pools expanded our product offering and distribution channels into the aquatic fitness category evolution manufacturing expanded our offering of fiberglass and composite windows in the united kingdom we believe these acquisitions will accelerate the growth of and complement our current businesses watkins manufacturing and our ukbased window company respectively longerterm we may seek larger strategic acquisitions as our company continues to grow 

in addition during the financial recession of the last decade we actively managed our portfolio of companies by divesting of those businesses that did not align with our longterm growth strategy including in 2015 the spin off of our installation and other services businesses into an independent publiclytraded company named topbuild we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies we also intend to pay down between 300 million and 500 million of our debt over the next several quarters 

our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 98 percent and 75 percent at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

on june 15 2015 we repaid and retired all of our 500 million 48 notes on the scheduled retirement date 

on march 24 2015 we issued 500 million of 445 notes due april 1 2025 these notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at our option 

on march 28 2013 we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion and a maturity date of march 28 2018 on may 29 2015 and august 28 2015 we amended the credit agreement with the bank group the amended credit agreement the amended credit agreement reduces the aggregate commitment to 750 million and extends the maturity date to may 29 2020 under the amended credit agreement at our request and subject to certain conditions we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional 375 million with the current bank group or new lenders see note k to the consolidated financial statements 

the amended credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a a maximum net leverage ratio as adjusted for certain items of 40 to 10 and b a minimum interest coverage ratio as adjusted for certain items equal to or greater than 25 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants and had no borrowings under our amended credit agreement at december 31 2015 

we had cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits of approximately 17 billion at december 31 2015 our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

of the 17 billion of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits we held at both december 31 2015 and 2014 630 million and 672 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us would not result in significant additional us income tax or foreign withholding tax as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro british pound and the us dollar commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis 

in the third quarter of 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend to 095 per common share from 09 per common share 

our current ratio was 13 to 1 and 16 to 1 at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in the current ratio was due to the approximately 500 million increase in shortterm notes payable at december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 due to scheduled debt maturities 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



our working capital days were as follows 



net cash provided by operations of 699 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 133 million a 212 million net increase in deferred taxes and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays 

net cash used for financing activities was 410 million primarily due to the retirement of 500 million of 48 notes due june 2015 456 million for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value and includes 741 thousand shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2015 126 million for cash dividends paid and 36 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest other financing activities include the issuance of 497 million of notes 75 million tax benefit from stockbased compensation and 200 million of cash received from topbuild as a result of its new debt financing agreement offset by 63 million of cash distributed to topbuild 

in september 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise replacing the previous board of directors authorization established in 2007 at december 31 2015 we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 278 million shares of our common stock consistent with past practice we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2016 as part of our strategic initiative as part of our capital management strategy we expect to repurchase up to 500 million of our common stock in 2016 some of these shares will be purchased to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted as part of our compensation programs 

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities 

net cash used for investing activities was 189 million and included 158 million for capital expenditures 41 million for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and 43 million for instore displays investing activities also include net cash provided from the sale of shortterm bank deposits of 26 million 

we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2015 were 158 million compared with 128 million for 2014 and 126 million for 2013 for 2016 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2016 acquisitions are expected to be approximately 190 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2015 totaled 133 million compared with 167 million for 2014 and 186 million for 2013 including accelerated depreciation of 1 million and 13 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively for 2016 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2016 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 140 million amortization expense totaled 11 million 10 million and 11 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results under gaap 

sales and operations

net sales for 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume of north american cabinets such increase in cabinets was partially offset by a less favorable product mix plumbing products paints and stains builders hardware and windows net sales of international plumbing products and cabinets also increased sales 

our gross profit margins were 315 percent 294 percent and 290 percent in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the 2015 and 2014 gross profit margins were positively affected by increased sales volume as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs both 2015 and 2014 reflect the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 187 percent in 2015 compared with 192 percent in 2014 and 199 percent in 2013 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2015 and 2014 reflect increased sales and the effect of cost containment measures

operating profit margins in 2015 and 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit in 2015 was negatively affected by foreign currency translation 

other income expense net 

other net for 2015 included net gains of 6 million from investments in private equity funds and 2 million from equity investments other net for 2015 also included realized foreign currency losses of 14 million and other miscellaneous items 

other net for 2014 included net gains of 4 million from investments in private equity funds and realized foreign currency gains of 5 million and other miscellaneous items income from financial investments net for 2014 included losses from equity investments net of 2 million 

other net for 2013 included income from equity investments net of 16 million and gains of 11 million from investments in private equity funds other net for 2013 also included realized foreign currency losses of 21 million and other miscellaneous items 

in 2013 in conjunction with the transaction to sell our danish readytoassemble cabinet business included in discontinued operations we also disposed of a related danish holding company this disposition triggered the settlement of loans which resulted in the recognition of 18 million of currency translation expense which is included in other income expense net from continuing operations in the statement of operations 

interest expense was 225 million in 2015 and 2014 and 235 million in 2013 

income and earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to masco corporation 

income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2015 were 357 million and 103 per common share respectively income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2014 were 821 million and 228 per common share respectively income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2013 were 259 million and 72 per common share respectively 

our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 43 percent tax expense 71 percent tax benefit and 22 percent tax expense in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively compared to our normalized tax rate of 36 percent the variance in 2015 is primarily due to a 21 million valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets of topbuild recorded as a noncash charge to income tax expense the topbuild deferred tax assets have been impaired by our decision to spin off topbuild into a separate company that on a standalone basis as of june 30 2015 the spin off date will unlikely be able to realize the value of such deferred tax assets as a result of its history of losses 

the 2015 effective tax rate also includes a 19 million charge to income tax expense to recognize the required taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings except for those that are legally restricted this charge was the result of our determination that we may need to repatriate earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently reinvested in order to provide greater flexibility in the execution of our capital management strategy 

the variance from our normalized tax rate in 2014 and 2013 is due primarily to changes in the us federal valuation allowance and reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions 

outlook for the company

we believe we will continue to see steady demand for our marketleading products as both repair and remodel demand and new home construction continue to improve we believe and are confident that the longterm fundamentals for home improvement activity and new home construction continue to be positive we believe that our strong financial position together with our current strategy of investing in our industryleading branded building products including kraftmaid® and merillat® cabinets delta® peerless® and hansgrohe® faucet bath and shower fixtures hot spring® and caldera® spas behr® paint primer and stain kilz® primer liberty® and brainerd® decorative hardware and milgard® windows and doors our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation will allow us to drive longterm growth and create value for our shareholders

we continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalizations and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations we do not anticipate that any costs and charges related to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will be as significant as they have been in previous years

 item 1 business 

masco corporation manufactures distributes and installs home improvement and building products with an emphasis on brandname consumer products and services holding leadership positions we are among the largest manufacturers in north america of a number of home improvement and building products including faucets cabinets architectural coatings and windows and we are a leading provider of services that include the installation of insulation and other building products we provide broad product offerings in a variety of styles and price points and distribute products through multiple channels including directly to homebuilders and wholesale and retail channels approximately 81 percent of our 2014 sales were generated by our north american operations 

the market for home improvement and building products at retailers increased by approximately four percent during 2014 despite continued economic uncertainties and modest consumer spending housing starts increased approximately ten percent during 2014 

throughout 2014 we continued the execution of our strategy to position the company for future growth focusing on three strategic pillars leveraging opportunities across our businesses driving the full potential of our core businesses and actively managing our portfolio we achieved gains in each of these areas first we leveraged our product leadership positions by expanding our brands and introducing innovative new and improved products we believe that we gained share in our north american plumbing business with our delta® peerless® and brizo® brands and internationally with our hansgrohe® products in addition to its strong position with the doityourself consumer our decorative architectural products businesses continued to focus on the professional segment with behrpro® paint and kilz® prox product lines behr® paint expanded its marquee® product line from exterior paint to interior paint and continued to pursue international opportunities milgard manufacturing our manufacturer of windows in the western us and our uk window group continued to gain share 

to help drive the full potential of our core businesses the second pillar of our strategy we adopted a leaner operating model we are transforming our corporate structure to a centerled model we believe this model will increase our business units efficiencies and our overall effectiveness as an organization this change will align our corporate structure to support our strategy to drive the full potential of our businesses in addition we continued reducing costs and implementing lean principles and production process improvements our installation and other services segments saw progress toward its goals during 2014 through incremental new home construction activity cost reductions from lean processes and leveraging our erp system and supply chain savings during 2014 we remained focused on improvements at our cabinets and related products businesses which continued to face challenges 

the third pillar of our strategy is to actively manage our portfolio in september 2014 we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our installation and other services businesses into an independent publiclytraded company through a taxfree stock distribution to our shareholders we believe that these businesses will be better positioned to operate as a separate company that will focus on growth by capitalizing on new home construction in the united states as well as further expanding into commercial and retrofit categories the transaction is expected to be completed in mid2015 

to further drive value creation for our shareholders our board of directors approved the repurchase of an aggregate 50 million shares of our common stock and increased our dividend by 20 percent during 2014 we repurchased 7 million shares including 17 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2014 to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards of our common stock at december 31 2014 we had approximately 17 billion of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits 

we believe that the actions we took during 2014 help provide the foundation for us to enhance future shareholder value we also believe that the spinoff of our installation and other services businesses will allow us to pursue a more focused strategy of growth through the innovation and manufacturing of 

branded building products we plan to continue to actively manage our portfolio identify growth opportunities in key industries and produce new products that differentiate us in the marketplace by continuing our disciplined execution of our strategy we believe that we will increase shareholder value by enhancing our customer experience and improving our efficiencies 

our business segments 

we report our financial results in five business segments aggregated by similarity in products and services the following table sets forth the contribution of our segments to net sales and operating profit loss for the three years ended december 31 2014 additional financial information concerning our operations by segment and by geographic regions as well as general corporate expense net as of and for the three years ended december 31 2014 is set forth in note p to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 



1 amounts exclude discontinued operations 2 operating profit loss is before general corporate expense net and gain on sale of fixed assets net 3 operating profit loss is before income of 9 million regarding the 2014 litigation settlement in the decorative architectural products segment and before net charges of 77 million regarding the 2012 litigation settlement primarily in the installation and other services segment 4 operating profit loss includes impairment charges for other intangible assets as follows for 2012 – other specialty products – 42 million 

all of our operating segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for new home construction and repair and remodel activity 

cabinets and related products 

in north america we manufacture and sell valuepriced stock and semicustom assembled cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points to address consumer preferences we have also expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the manufacture and sale of kitchen countertops as well as an integrated bathroom vanity and countertop solution in the united kingdom we manufacture and sell assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath and storage cabinetry our kraftmaid® brand is sold primarily to dealers home centers and mass merchants and our merillat® moores™ and quality cabinets™ brands are sold primarily to dealers and homebuilders for both home improvement and new home construction cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects a significant portion of our sales for home improvement are made through home center retailers 

our cabinets and related products segment was particularly affected by the economic downturn and decline in new home construction and repair and remodel activity while improving consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects continues to be below normal levels which impacts our profitability although home construction is improving and is expected to continue to improve the demand for new homes remains below the historic average and demand has increased for multifamily housing units which are smaller than singlefamily housing units and require fewer cabinets for the kitchen and bathrooms in addition our initiatives to improve this segment including rationalizing our businesses closing plants and reducing headcount have been complex timeconsuming and expensive the consolidation of our north american cabinet businesses has involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and information technology platforms and continues to affect our operations we continue to focus on our cost structure in this segment and improving cabinet production efficiencies although faced with challenges we are continuing to pursue our strategy to increase sales in this segment through brand building new product introductions aimed to provide differentiated products to our multiple sales channels and product innovation 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and the united kingdom includes several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in recent years we have experienced significant competition in the form of discounts and new product offerings by our competitors which have impacted the segments results of operations we also face competition from foreign manufacturers in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection our north american competitors include american woodmark corporation fortune brands home  security inc and norcraft companies inc 

the raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber plywood and particleboard and are available from multiple sources both domestic and foreign 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of faucet bathing and showering devices that are manufactured by or for us the majority of our plumbing products are sold in north america and europe under the brand names delta® peerless® hansgrohe® axor® brizo® brasstech® bristan™ ginger® heritage™ newport brass® and plumb shop® our products include singlehandle and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers valves bathing units and toilets these products are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors that in turn sell our products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others

in 2014 we completed the process of integrating our plumbing products sold under our aqua glass® and american shower  bath™ brands into the delta and peerless brands our acrylic tub and shower systems bath and shower enclosure units shower trays and laundry tubs are now manufactured and sold under the delta peerless and mirolin® brand names these products are sold primarily to home center retailers for home improvement and new home construction in north america although our mirolin products are also sold to wholesalers and distributors in canada

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe with american standard brands kohler co fortune brands home  security inc and pfister faucets as major competitors we are also experiencing competition from foreign manufacturers including grohe particularly in germany china and the middle east we face significant competition from private label products including house brands sold by certain of our customers many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price the businesses in our plumbing products segment source products primarily from asia and manufacture products in the united states europe and asia in addition to price we believe that competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation product quality product innovation and features and breadth of product offering 

a substantial portion of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have multiple sources both domestic and foreign for the raw materials used in this segment and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc therefore we have implemented a hedging strategy to help reduce the impact of this volatility 

federal legislation mandating a national standard for lead content in plumbing products used to convey drinking water became effective in january 2014 faucet and water supply valve manufacturers including our plumbing product companies are required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets and certain of our other plumbing products our plumbing products that are affected by this legislation meet the federal standards including our delta faucet products that use diamond™ seal technology which also reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet and simplifies installation 

installation and other services 

our installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily for new home construction and to a lesser extent retrofit and commercial construction throughout the united states in addition to insulation we sell installed gutters afterpaint products garage doors and fireplaces the installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately thirteen percent twelve percent and eleven percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we install building products primarily to homebuilders through our network of branches located across the united states our distributed products include insulation insulation

our behr products are principally sold through the home depot this segments and our largest customer the loss of this segments sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segments business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint the price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of surges in global demand and production capacity limitations which can impact our operating results in this segment petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs eg for resins solvents and packaging as well as titanium dioxide which can adversely affect the segments results of operations we have agreements with the significant suppliers of the major raw materials used in this segment which are intended to help assure continued availability

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our business 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity both of which are cyclical 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including spending on repair and remodeling projects and new home construction activity principally in north america and europe macroeconomic conditions including consumer confidence levels fluctuations in home prices unemployment and underemployment levels student loan debt household formation and the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for such loans affect both consumers discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity adverse changes or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction both of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position while improving both new home construction and consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects continue to be below historic average levels 

if we do not maintain strong brands or respond to changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices we could lose share and our results could be adversely affected 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products while we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness these initiatives may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if we do not introduce new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance we could lose share which could negatively impact our operating results 

the challenging economic environment of recent years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our customers consumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and to inform and provide feedback on their purchasing and ownership experience for these products ebusiness is a rapidly developing area and development of a successful ebusiness strategy involves significant time investment and resources if we are unable to successfully execute our ebusiness strategy our brands may lose share 

similarly the quantity type and prices of products demanded by consumers and our customers have shifted for example demand has increased for multifamily housing units such as apartments and condominiums which typically have smaller kitchens and smaller and fewer bathrooms each with fewer cabinets and faucets as well as less insulation than singlefamily houses while the economy is recovering we are experiencing growth in certain channels for lower price point products in some of our segments these shifts have negatively impacted our sales andor our profitability and it is uncertain whether these shifts represent longterm changes in consumer preferences 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic and operational initiatives or our actions to improve our underperforming cabinetry businesses 

in 2014 we announced new strategic initiatives which are designed to increase shareholder value over the mid to longterm our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to execute these strategic initiatives or if we are unable to execute them in a timely and efficient manner we have also identified a number of operational initiatives which include making significant investments in technology systems that are key to managing our business we could be adversely affected if we do not effectively implement our operational initiatives in a timely manner 

the downturn in home improvement and new home construction activity during the recent recession impacted our results particularly at our cabinetry businesses in response we have implemented initiatives to reduce costs and increase sales however there is no assurance that our efforts will yield all of the anticipated benefits our initiatives to improve our cabinetry operations including rationalizing our businesses closing plants and reducing headcount have been complex timeconsuming and expensive the consolidation of our north american cabinet businesses in particular involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and information technology platforms and continues to affect our operations 

our strategy to increase our cabinetry businesses sales through brand building enhanced customer relationships and new product introductions requires time to implement execute and assess further these businesses continue to face pricing pressures competition from lowcost manufacturers and a shift in the mix of products in certain channels to more valuepriced products if our strategy to increase our sales is not successful our results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses continues to increase in 2014 net sales to our largest customer the home depot were 23 billion approximately 27 percent of consolidated net sales lowes is our second largest customer in 2014 sales to lowes were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales these home center customers may reduce the number of vendors they purchase from and can make significant changes in their volume of purchases additionally home centers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services our cost of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business if the mix of our business operations significantly changes including as a result of acquisitions or divestitures our reliance on these significant customers may increase although homebuilders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowes would have a material adverse effect on our business 

further as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur which could impact our results of operations we may undermine the business relationships we have with our current customers if we increase the amount of business we transact directly with consumers in addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale 

we face significant competition 

our products and services face significant competition we believe that we compete on the basis of price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features and innovation home centers continue to purchase select products in our segments directly from lowcost foreign manufacturers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise additionally home centers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly marketing directly to professional contractors and installers which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

in our other distribution channels we compete with foreign manufacturers in a variety of our product groups these foreign manufacturers are putting downward pressures on price in some of our segments we are continuing to experience a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more valuepriced or opening price point products which may impact our ability to maintain or gain share and our profitability 

our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries and to grow our businesses depends upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies and entering new geographic areas including successful international penetration developing a successful ebusiness strategy maintaining strong brands managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and developing and innovating products none of which is assured 

if we experience increased commodity costs or limited availability of commodities our operating results could be negatively impacted 

we buy various commodities to manufacture our products including among others wood brass made of copper and zinc titanium dioxide and resins fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products further increases in energy costs could increase our production costs as well as our transportation costs each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we may receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices 

to help reduce price volatility associated with certain anticipated commodity purchases we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy may increase the possibility that we may make commitments to purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers and manufacturers and the loss of a key supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results 

our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of products and components from manufacturers and other suppliers we rely heavily or in certain cases exclusively on thirdparty suppliers for some of our products and key components failure by our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant 

costs accordingly the loss of a key supplier or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operating results 

further we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain our operating results could be negatively affected 

if we cannot adequately protect or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property we may be adversely affected 

protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts we own a number of patents trade names brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations our intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected in addition the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms furthermore others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position which could affect our results of operations 

international political monetary economic and social developments affect our business 

approximately 19 percent of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally the euro and the british pound sterling increasing our international sales is an important part of our future strategic plans in addition we manufacture products in asia and source products components and raw materials from third parties in asia we face risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws and regulations affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws laws regulating various business practices and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs can also impact us our international operating results may also be influenced by economic conditions in europe in addition our financial results could be adversely affected by the currency conversion rate if the us dollar strengthens in value relative to foreign currencies particularly the euro and fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract and retain key employees or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results further as the economy continues to recover if we are unable to recruit train and retain sufficient skilled labor we may not be able to 

adequately satisfy increased demand for our products and services which could impact our operating results 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are from time to time involved in various claims litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us these matters may include contract disputes automobile liability and other personal injury claims warranty disputes environmental claims or proceedings other tort claims employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation including class actions 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend or manage also we rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability and wage and hour issues we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases due to their scope and complexity however these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend and resolve and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits 

our homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities these claims often asserted several years after completion of construction can result in complex lawsuits or claims against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including us and may require us to incur defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see note u to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

if we are required to take additional significant noncash charges our financial resources could be reduced and our financial flexibility may be negatively affected 

we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to prior business combinations on our balance sheet the valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses expectations about the growth of new home construction and home improvement activity may impact whether we are required to recognize additional noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets or other longlived assets if the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets is further impaired our earnings and shareholders equity would be adversely affected 

further our credit agreement contains financial covenants we must comply with including covenants regarding limits on our debt to total capitalization ratio if we are required to record additional noncash impairment charges our shareholders equity would be reduced and our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement may be limited we have negotiated amendments to our credit agreement to allow for the addback to shareholders equity for impairment charges we have taken there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend our credit agreement that alternative financing would be available on acceptable terms and at acceptable rates or that we would be permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 

compliance with government regulation and industry standards could impact our operating results 

we are subject to federal state and foreign government regulations particularly those pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers climate disruption and environmental issues in addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on us in the future additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with these regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our product designs our manufacturing and installation processes or our sourcing such actions could divert our attention and resources to compliance activities and could cause us to incur higher costs further if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our results of operations could be negatively affected 

our operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions 

we rely on a number of information technology systems to process transmit store and manage information to support our business activities increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems we have established security policies processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations despite these efforts our systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access malicious software undetected intrusion hardware failures or other events and in these circumstances our disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate these breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption exposure of proprietary or confidential information data corruption damage to our reputation exposure to litigation and increased operational costs such events could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operation in addition we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation 

risks related to our proposed spinoff transaction 

we are pursuing a plan to spinoff our installation and other services segment our services business we are incurring significant costs in connection with this transaction which also requires considerable time and attention of our management and we may not be able to complete the transaction or if the transaction is completed realize the anticipated benefits 

in september 2014 we announced a plan to separate our services business from our other businesses through a spinoff transaction in which we would distribute the common stock of the services business to our existing shareholders in a taxfree transaction completion of the transaction will be contingent upon approval by our board of directors our receipt of an opinion from tax counsel the 

effectiveness of a registration statement on form 10 and certain other conditions additionally our ability to complete the spinoff in a timely manner if at all could be affected by several factors including 

• our ability to obtain sufficient financing for the newlycreated entity on acceptable terms • our ability to obtain any necessary consents or approvals • changes in the underlying businesses contracts or customers and • political and economic conditions at the time of the transaction for these and other reasons we may not be able to complete the spinoff within the expected time frame or at all even if the transaction is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spinoff we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with this transaction which will affect our profitability and operating results through completion of the transaction executing the proposed spinoff also requires considerable time and attention from management which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business and executing our other strategic initiatives 

the proposed spinoff of our services business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

among the conditions to completing the spinoff will be our receipt of an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff and certain related transactions will qualify for taxfree treatment under certain sections of the internal revenue code however if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business we will not be able to rely on the opinion furthermore the opinion will not be binding on the internal revenue service irs or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinion the spinoff transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff transaction is taxable each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new services business company would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received thereby potentially increasing such holders tax liability 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution could be taxable to us but not to our stockholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of the new services business company are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spinoff we expect to enter into a tax matters agreement with the new services business company under which it will agree not to enter into any transaction without our consent that could cause any portion of the spinoff to be taxable to us and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction these obligations and potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us or of the new services business company

executive level overview 

we manufacture distribute and install home improvement and building products these products are sold for home improvement and new home construction through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer 

2014 results 

net sales were positively affected by increased new home construction and repair and remodel activity in the us and europe such increases were partially offset by decreased sales volume in our north american cabinetry business our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs except in paints and stains our results of operations were negatively affected by increased business rationalization costs and costs associated with our proposed spinoff transaction most of our business segments also benefited from the business rationalizations and cost savings initiatives we have undertaken over the last several years 

our cabinets and related products segment was negatively affected by lower sales volume of our north american operations which completely offset a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and any increased sales volume by our uk cabinet business our plumbing products segment benefited from increased sales volume of north american and international operations as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs the installation and other services segment benefited from increased new home construction and 

commercial activity and a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs the decorative architectural products segment benefited from increased sales volume of paints and stains and builders hardware which was offset by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs in paints and stains our other specialty products segment benefited from a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and a more favorable product mix of us and uk windows as well as increased sales volume 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

note a to our consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables receivables include unbilled revenue related to the installation and other services segment of 24 million at both december 31 2014 and 2013 we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments in addition we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by accounting guidance 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and 

appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and estimated repair and remodel activity 

in 2014 we utilized estimated housing starts from independent industry sources growing from current levels to 145 million units in 2019 terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical levels for those business units by 2019 terminal growth year we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital decreased in 2014 primarily due to lower bond rates in 2014 based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 110 percent to 140 percent for our reporting units 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values accordingly we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill 

a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2014 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional reporting unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 2014 we recognized an insignificant impairment charge for other indefinitelived intangible assets 

employee retirement plans 

effective january 1 2010 we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2014 our discount rate decreased for obligations to an average of 380 percent from 440 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each defined 

benefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2014 towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 200 percent to 400 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 370 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 454 million at december 31 2014 from 324 million at december 31 2013 our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 190 million at december 31 2014 compared with 163 million at december 31 2013 

the increase in the projected benefit obligations was primarily due to lower bond rates and a change to the rp 2014 mortality tables issued by the us society of actuaries which increased our longterm pension liabilities our qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2014 had a net gain of 36 percent compared to average gains of 95 percent for the investorforce defined benefit plan universe 

at december 31 2014 we reported a net liability of 644 million of which 190 million was related to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plans which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 79 percent to 90 percent 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 23 million in 2015 compared with 16 million in 2014 if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2015 pension expense would increase by 5 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 10 million in 2015 compared with 9 million in 2014 

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 55 million to 65 million in 2015 to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans 

income taxes 

the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

in 2010 we recorded a 372 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position 

during 2012 and 2011 objective and verifiable negative evidence such as us operating losses and significant impairment charges for us goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets continued to 

outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance as a result we recorded increases of 65 million and 87 million in the valuation allowance related to our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in the third quarter of 2014 we recorded a 517 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance against our us federal and certain state deferred tax assets due primarily to a return to sustainable profitability in our us operations in reaching this conclusion we considered the continued improvement in both the new home construction market and repair and remodel activity in the us and our progress on strategic initiatives to reduce costs and expand our product leadership positions which contributed to the continued improvement in our us operations over the past few years 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded an additional 12 million tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowances against certain uk and mexican deferred tax assets primarily resulting from a return to sustainable profitability in these jurisdictions 

we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on certain state and foreign deferred tax assets as of december 31 2014 should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

it is reasonably possible that the continued improvements in certain of our businesses located in the us could result in the objective positive evidence necessary to warrant the additional reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance up to approximately 27 million by the end of 2015 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

warranty 

at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage the warranty period historical experience specific to the nature frequency and average cost to service the claim along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and demographic trends 

certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals 

a majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 

litigation 

we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments 

corporate development strategy 

our business strategy includes expanding our product leadership and implementing lean principles and product process improvements across our business units going forward we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow organic growth with smaller acquisitions and growth through new product development 

as part of our strategic planning we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

on september 30 2014 we announced a plan to spin off 100 percent of our installation and other services businesses into an independent publiclytraded company through a taxfree stock distribution to our shareholders the transaction is expected to be completed in mid2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies 

our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 75 percent and 81 percent at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

on march 28 2013 we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion and a maturity date of march 28 2018 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio as adjusted for certain items of 65 percent and b a minimum interest coverage ratio as adjusted for certain items equal to or greater than 25 to 10 the debt to total capitalization ratio allows the addback if incurred of up to the first 250 million of certain noncash charges including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges occurring from and after january 1 2012 that would negatively impact shareholders equity 

at december 31 2014 we had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 12 billion alternatively at december 31 2014 we could absorb a reduction to shareholders equity of approximately 747 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant we were in compliance with all credit agreement covenants and we had no borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2014 

we had cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits of approximately 17 billion at december 31 2014 our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

of the 17 billion and the 15 billion of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits we held at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 672 million and 622 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us may result in additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes the amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis 

in the second quarter of 2014 we increased our quarterly dividend to 09 per common share from 075 per common share 

our current ratio was 17 to 1 and 21 to 1 at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the decrease in the current ratio was due to the shortterm classification of 500 million of 48 notes due june 2015 at december 31 2014 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



our working capital days were as follows 



net cash provided by operations of 602 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 167 million a 406 million net decrease in deferred taxes and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays our cash provided by operations was positively affected by increased sales and more effective accounts payable management 

net cash used for financing activities was 297 million primarily due to 158 million for the repurchase and retirement of company common stock in open market transactions as part of our strategic initiative to drive shareholder value and includes 17 million shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2014 117 million for cash dividends paid and 34 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest 

in september 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares for retirement of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise replacing the previous board of directors authorization established in 2007 during the fourth quarter of 2014 we repurchased and retired 5 million common shares for cash of 119 million at december 31 2014 we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 45 million shares of our common stock we expect to repurchase between 400 million and 500 million of our common stock in 2015 

we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities consistent with past practice we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2015 as part of our strategic initiative and to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted as part of our compensation programs 

net cash used for investing activities was 100 million and included 128 million for capital expenditures cash provided by investing activities included primarily 63 million from the net sale of financial investments and 16 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment investing activities also include net cash used for the purchase of shortterm bank deposits of 20 million 

we continue to invest in our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation as well as to invest in our distribution facilities capital expenditures for 2014 were 128 million compared with 126 million for 2013 and 119 million for 2012 for 2015 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2015 acquisitions are expected to be approximately 190 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2014 totaled 167 million compared with 186 million for 2013 and 214 million for 2012 including accelerated depreciation of 1 million 13 million and 28 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively for 2015 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2015 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 154 million amortization expense totaled 10 million 11 million and 12 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2014 were 85 billion which increased four percent compared with 2013 the effect of currency translation and acquisitions was insignificant compared with 2013 the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 



net sales for 2014 were positively affected by increased sales volume of north american plumbing products installation and other services paints and stains builders hardware and windows which in aggregate increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2013 net sales for 2014 were also positively affected by selling prices for cabinets international plumbing products installation and other services and windows which in aggregate increased sales by approximately two percent net sales for 2014 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of cabinets and by lower selling prices of paints and stains 

net sales for 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume of north american cabinets such increase in cabinets was partially offset by a less favorable product mix installation and other services plumbing products paints and stains builders hardware and windows which in aggregate increased sales by approximately seven percent compared to 2012 net sales of international plumbing products and cabinets also increased sales by one percent compared to 2012 net sales for 2013 were also positively affected by selling prices which increased sales by approximately one percent net sales for 2013 were negatively affected by lower selling prices of paints and stains 

net sales for 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume of installed products north american plumbing products paints and stains builders hardware and windows and selling price increases net sales for 2012 were negatively affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet and window product lines in certain geographic areas 

our gross profit margins were 280 percent 276 percent and 261 percent in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 2014 and 2013 gross profit margin reflects a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as increased sales volume both 2014 and 2013 reflect the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 189 percent in 2014 compared with 194 percent in 2013 and 205 percent in 2012 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2014 and 2013 reflect increased sales both 2014 and 2013 also reflect the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

the following table reconciles reported operating profit to operating profit as adjusted to exclude certain items dollars in millions 



operating margins in 2014 and 2013 were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs increased sales volume and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

other income expense net 

other net for 2014 included gains of 4 million from private equity funds and realized foreign currency gains of 5 million and other miscellaneous items other net for 2014 included losses from equity investments net of 2 million 

other net for 2013 included income from equity investments net of 16 million and gains of 11 million from private equity funds other net for 2013 also included realized foreign currency losses of 18 million and other miscellaneous items 

in 2013 in conjunction with the transaction to sell our danish readytoassemble cabinet business included in discontinued operations we also disposed of a related danish holding company this disposition triggered the settlement of loans which resulted in the recognition of 18 million of currency translation expense which is included in other income expense net from continuing operations in the statement of operations 

other net for 2012 included net gains of 24 million from private equity funds during 2012 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 2 million for an investment in a private equity fund other net for 2012 also included realized foreign currency losses of 2 million and other miscellaneous items 

interest expense was 225 million in 2014 235 million in 2013 and 254 million in 2012

 item 1 business 

masco corporation manufactures distributes and installs home improvement and building products with an emphasis on brandname consumer products and services holding leadership positions we are among the largest manufacturers in north america of a number of home improvement and building products including faucets cabinets architectural coatings and windows and we are one of the largest installers of insulation for new home construction we provide broad product offerings in a variety of styles and price points and distribute products through multiple channels including directly to homebuilders and wholesale and retail channels approximately 81 percent of our 2013 sales were generated by our north american operations 

sales of home improvement and building products at retailers increased by almost 6 percent during 2013 despite continued economic uncertainties weak consumer confidence and modest consumer spending housing starts increased approximately 18 percent during 2013 with the pace slowing in the second half of the year 

throughout 2013 we continued to focus on our four strategic initiatives to improve our performance and we achieved gains in each of those areas first we are extending and expanding our product leadership positions by leveraging our brands and introducing innovative new and improved products we believe that we gained market share in our north american plumbing business with our delta® peerless® and brizo® brands and internationally with our hansgrohe® products our decorative architectural products businesses focused on the professional segment with behrpro® paint and kilz® prox product lines behr® paint also expanded its product offering by introducing its marquee™ exterior paint and premium deckover® solid color coating for wood and concrete surfaces and by pursuing international opportunities milgard manufacturing our manufacturer of windows in the western us and our uk window group continued to gain share in their markets our masco contractor services business continued to achieve share gains in the installation of insulation for the new home construction retrofit and commercial channels 

another strategic initiative is to improve our performance by reducing costs primarily through supply chain savings and implementing lean principles and production process improvements over the last several years we have taken out over 600 million of fixed costs on a gross basis we continue to seek improvements in our global supply chain to realize cost savings by or through simplifying the purchasing process and coordinating logistical operations 

another strategic initiative is to improve our underperforming businesses and during 2013 we saw our cabinets and related products and our installation and other services segments return to profitability approximately one third 200 million of our fixed cost reduction was attributable to our cabinetry businesses and one third came from our insulation businesses by lowering our breakeven point each of these segments saw a return to profitability during 2013 at much lower levels of revenue than historically by reducing our fixed costs we believe that we are strengthening the foundation for continued growth our installation segment continued its improvement during 2013 through incremental new home construction activity cost reductions from lean processes leveraging our erp system and supply chain savings 

our final strategic initiative is strengthening our balance sheet through net debt reduction and maintaining strong liquidity through continued working capital improvements we continued to reduce our debt by approximately 200 million through the retirement of notes due in august at december 31 2013 we had approximately 15 billion of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits 

we believe that we have managed our businesses successfully through the economic crisis and subsequent recession of recent years we believe that our focus on our strategic initiatives of expanding our product leadership positions reducing costs improving our underperforming businesses and 

strengthening our balance sheet have improved our performance and as we continue to focus on these initiatives will position us well as our markets continue to recover

all of our operating segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for new home construction and repair and remodel activity 

cabinets and related products 

in north america we manufacture and sell valuepriced stock and semicustom assembled cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points to address consumer preferences we have also expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the manufacture and sale of kitchen countertops as well as an integrated bathroom vanity and countertop solution in the united kingdom we manufacture and sell assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath and storage cabinetry our kraftmaid® brand is sold primarily to dealers home centers and mass merchants and our merillat® moores™ and quality cabinets™ brands are sold primarily to dealers and homebuilders for both home improvement and new home construction cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects a significant portion of our sales for home improvement are made through home center retailers 

our cabinet segment was particularly affected by the economic downturn and decline in new home construction and repair and remodel activity while improving consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects continues to be below normal levels which impacts our profitability although home construction is improving and is expected to continue to improve the demand for new homes remains below the historic average and demand has increased for multifamily housing units which are smaller than singlefamily housing units and require fewer cabinets for the kitchen and bathrooms we continue our strategy to increase sales in this segment through brand building new product introductions aimed to provide differentiated products to our multiple sales channels and product innovation we also continue to focus on our cost structure in this segment and improving cabinet production efficiencies 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and the united kingdom includes several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in recent years we have experienced significant competition in the form of discounts and new product offerings by our competitors which have impacted the segments results of operations we also face competition from foreign manufacturers in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection our north american competitors include american woodmark corporation and fortune brands home  security inc 

the raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber plywood and particleboard and are available from multiple sources both domestic and foreign 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of faucet bathing and showering devices that are manufactured by or for us the majority of our plumbing products are sold in north america and europe under the brand names delta® peerless® hansgrohe® axor® brizo® brasstech® bristan™ ginger® newport brass and plumb shop® our products include singlehandle and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers valves bathing units and toilets these products are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors that in turn sell our products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others 

in 2013 we began the process of integrating our plumbing products sold under our aqua glass® and american shower  bath™ brands into the delta and peerless brands as a result of the integration we exited the wholesale plumbing distribution channel for these bath products our 

innovex® and acrylic tub and shower systems bath and shower enclosure units shower trays and laundry tubs are now manufactured and sold under the delta and peerless aqua glass american shower  bath and mirolin® brand names these products are sold primarily to home center retailers for home improvement and new home construction in north america although the mirolin products are also sold to wholesalers and distributors in canada 

our spas are manufactured and sold under hot spring® caldera® and other trademarks directly to independent dealers major competitors include kohler aquatic maax and jacuzzi we sell hÜppe® shower enclosures through wholesale channels in europe heritage™ ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally sold in the united kingdom directly to select retailers

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe with american standard kohler moen and pfister as major competitors we are also experiencing competition from foreign manufacturers including grohe particularly in germany china and the middle east we face significant competition from private label products including house brands sold by certain of our customers many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressures on price particularly in the emerging markets we are entering the businesses in our plumbing products segment source products primarily from asia and manufacture products in the united states europe and asia in addition to price we believe that competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation product quality product innovation and features and breadth of product offering 

a substantial portion of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have multiple sources both domestic and foreign for the raw materials used in this segment and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc therefore we have implemented a hedging strategy to minimize the impact of this volatility federal legislation mandating a national standard for lead content in plumbing products used to convey drinking water became effective in january 2014 faucet and water supply valve manufacturers including our plumbing product companies are required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets and certain of our other plumbing products our plumbing products that are affected by this legislation meet the federal standards our delta faucet business uses diamond™ seal technology which reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet simplifies installation and satisfies legislation regarding the acceptable lead content in plumbing products 

installation and other services 

our installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily for new home construction and to a lesser extent retrofit and commercial construction throughout the united states in addition to insulation we sell installed gutters afterpaint products garage doors and fireplaces the installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately twelve percent eleven percent and nine percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively installed building products are supplied primarily to homebuilders by our network of branches located across the united states our distributed products include insulation insulation accessories gutters and roofing among others distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers including lumber yards from distribution centers in various parts of the united states

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint the price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of surges in global demand and production capacity limitations which can impact our operating results in this segment petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs eg for resins solvents and packaging as well as titanium dioxide which can adversely affect the segments results of operations we have agreements with the significant suppliers of the major raw materials used in this segment which are intended to help assure continued availability

 item 1a risk factors 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity both of which are cyclical 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including spending on repair and remodeling projects and new home construction activity principally in north america and europe macroeconomic conditions including consumer confidence levels fluctuations in home prices unemployment and underemployment levels and the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for such loans affect both consumers discretionary spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity adverse changes or uncertainty regarding these macroeconomic conditions could result in a decline in spending on home improvement projects and a decline in demand for new home construction both of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position while improving both new home construction and consumer spending for big ticket remodeling projects continues to be well below historic average levels which affect our results of operations 

if we do not maintain strong brands or respond to changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices we could lose share and our results could be adversely affected 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products while we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness these initiatives may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if we do not introduce new or improved products in a timely manner or if these products do not gain widespread acceptance we could lose share which could negatively impact our operating results 

the volatile and challenging economic environment of recent years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our customers for example consumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and to inform and enhance their purchasing and ownership experience for these products particularly with consumerinitiated messaging ebusiness is a rapidly developing area and development of a successful ebusiness strategy involves significant time investment and resources if we are unable to successfully execute our ebusiness strategy our brands may lose share 

similarly the quantity type and prices of products demanded by consumers and our customers have shifted for example demand has increased for multifamily housing units such as apartments and condominiums which typically have smaller kitchens and smaller and fewer bathrooms each with fewer cabinets and faucets as well less insulation than singlefamily houses while the economy is recovering we are experiencing growth in certain channels for lower price point products these shifts have negatively impacted our sales andor our profitability and it is uncertain whether these shifts represent longterm changes in consumer preferences 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed the 

demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

our actions to improve our underperforming businesses have been costly and may not yield all of the anticipated benefits 

the downturn in home improvement and new home construction activity during the recent recession impacted our results particularly in our cabinets and related products and installation and other services segments and certain businesses in our plumbing products segment in response we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and increase sales however there is no assurance that our efforts will yield all of the anticipated benefits our costsaving initiatives including rationalizing our businesses closing plants and reducing headcount have been complex timeconsuming and expensive the consolidation of our north american cabinet businesses in particular has involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and information technology platforms while we have experienced positive results from these initiatives there is no assurance that these benefits will continue 

our strategy to increase our sales in the cabinets and related products segment through brand building and new product introductions requires time to develop implement and assess further this segment faces pricing pressures competition from lowcost manufacturers and a shift in the mix of products in certain channels to more valuepriced products if we cannot successfully implement these initiatives or respond to these changing market dynamics our results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted 

further if the economy recovers faster than expected we may not be able to increase our manufacturing and installation capacity to support demand which could result in lost share and ultimately could negatively impact our operating results 

our sales are concentrated with two significant customers 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses continues to increase in 2013 sales to our largest customer the home depot were 23 billion approximately 28 percent of consolidated net sales lowes is our second largest customer in 2013 sales to lowes were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales these home center customers may reduce the number of vendors they purchase from and can make significant changes in their volume of purchases additionally home centers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services our cost of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business although homebuilders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowes would have a material adverse effect on our business 

further as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur which could impact our results of operations in addition we may undermine the business relationships we have with our current customers if we increase the amount of business we transact directly with consumers in addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale 

we face significant competition 

our products and services face significant competition we believe that we compete on the basis of price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features and innovation home centers continue to purchase select products in our segments directly from lowcost foreign manufacturers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise additionally home 

centers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly marketing directly to professional contractors and installers which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

in our other distribution channels we compete with foreign manufacturers in a variety of our product groups these foreign manufacturers are putting downward pressures on price particularly in the emerging markets we are entering in some of our segments we are experiencing a shift in the mix of products we sell toward more valuepriced or opening price point products which may impact our ability to maintain or gain share and our profitability 

our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries and to grow our businesses depends upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies and entering new geographic areas including successful international penetration developing a successful ebusiness strategy maintaining strong brands managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and developing and innovating products none of which is assured 

if we experience increased commodity costs or limited availability of commodities our operating results could be negatively impacted 

we buy various commodities to manufacture our products including among others wood brass made of copper and zinc titanium dioxide and resins fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products further increases in energy costs could increase our production costs as well as our transportation costs each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we may receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices 

to minimize price volatility associated with certain anticipated commodity purchases we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps this strategy may increase the possibility that we may make commitments to purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers and manufacturers and the loss of a key supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results 

our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of products and components from manufacturers and other suppliers we rely heavily or in certain cases exclusively on thirdparty suppliers for some of our products and key components failure by our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant costs accordingly the loss of a key supplier or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operating results 

further we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices 

shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain our operating results could be negatively affected 

international political monetary economic and social developments affect our business 

approximately 20 percent of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally the euro and the british pound sterling increased international sales make up an important part of our future strategic plans in addition we manufacture products in asia and source products components and raw materials from third parties in asia we face risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws and regulations affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws laws regulating various business practices and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs can also impact us our international operating results may also be influenced by economic conditions in europe the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract and retain key employees or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results further as the economy continues to recover if we are unable to recruit train and retain sufficient skilled labor we may not be able to adequately satisfy increased demand for our products and services which could impact our operating results 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are from time to time involved in various claims litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us these matters may include contract disputes automobile liability and other personal injury claims warranty disputes environmental claims or proceedings other tort claims employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation including class actions 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend or manage also we rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability and wage and hour issues we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases due to their scope and complexity however these lawsuits can be 

particularly costly to defend and resolve and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits 

our homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities these claims often asserted several years after completion of construction can result in complex lawsuits or claims against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including us and may require us to incur defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see note u to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

if we are required to take additional significant noncash charges our financial resources could be reduced and our financial flexibility may be negatively affected 

we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to prior business combinations on our balance sheet the valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses in recent years we have recorded significant noncash impairment charges for financial investments goodwill and other intangible assets while new home construction and home improvement activity are improving the extent of the recovery remains uncertain 

expectations about the recovery may impact whether we are required to recognize additional noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets or other longlived assets if the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets is further impaired our earnings and shareholders equity would be adversely affected 

we have also recorded a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets a return to sustainable profitability in our us operations is required before we would change our judgment regarding the need for this valuation allowance while we believe that we may reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance as early as the second half of 2014 this is not assured until such time the profits from our us operations will be offset by the net operating loss carryforward resulting in a lower us effective tax rate than we would normally incur 

further our credit agreement contains financial covenants we must comply with including covenants regarding limits on our debt to total capitalization ratio if we are required to record additional noncash impairment charges our shareholders equity would be reduced and our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement may be limited in the past we have negotiated amendments to our credit agreement to allow for the addback to shareholders equity for impairment charges we have taken there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend our credit agreement that alternative financing would be available on acceptable terms and at acceptable rates or that we would be permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 

compliance with government regulation and industry standards could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 

we are subject to us and foreign government regulations particularly those pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers climate disruption and environmental issues in addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with these regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing which could adversely impact our competitive position further if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our operating results could be negatively affected

executive level overview 

we manufacture distribute and install home improvement and building products these products are sold for home improvement and new home construction through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer 

2013 results net sales were positively affected by increased new home construction and repair and remodel activity in the us and europe our results of operations were positively affected by increased sales volume and the related absorption of fixed costs as well as a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs also all of our businesses were positively affected by the benefits associated with the business rationalizations and process improvement initiatives that we have implemented over the last several years 

our cabinets and related products segment was affected by increased sales volume and selling prices partially offset by a less favorable product mix our plumbing products segment results were favorably affected by increased sales volume and increased selling prices of our north american and international operations partially offset by the loss of a portion of our bath products business the decorative architectural products segment was affected by increased sales volume partially offset by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs the installation and other services and other specialty products segments were positively affected by increased sales volume and increased selling prices 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments in addition we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred bad debt expense related to customer defaults our bad debt expense was 8 million 14 million and 12 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

inventories 

we record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

financial investments 

we follow accounting guidance that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date further it defines a fair value hierarchy as follows level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data and level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 

if applicable we record investments in availableforsale securities at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax effect through shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 

in the past we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7 28 or 35 days at december 31 2013 our investment in auction rate securities was 22 million we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007 the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated on a recurring basis using a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately 1 million 

we have maintained investments in a number of private equity funds which aggregated 63 million at december 31 2013 we carry our investments in private equity funds and other private investments at cost it is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private investments because there are no quoted market prices and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund these investments are evaluated on a nonrecurring basis for potential otherthantemporary impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment due to the significant unobservable inputs the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a level 3 input 

impairment indicators we consider include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates industry and sector performance current equity and credit market conditions and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund including industry and sector performance the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential otherthantemporary impairment include current economic conditions market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in the applicable sectors 

we have and will continue to reduce our investments in longterm financial assets at december 31 2013 we have investments in 14 venture capital funds with an aggregate carrying value of 15 million the venture capital funds have invested in startup or smaller earlystage established businesses principally in the information technology biotechnology and health care sectors at december 31 2013 we also have investments in 15 buyout funds with an aggregate carrying value of 48 million the buyout funds have invested in laterstage established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 

since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments the timing of distributions from the funds which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash can be difficult to predict as a result the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 

we record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by accounting guidance our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information including fiveyear forecasts is available 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and estimated repair and remodel activity 

in 2013 we utilized estimated housing starts from independent industry sources growing from current levels to 15 million units in 2018 terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical levels for those business units by 2018 terminal growth year we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows our weighted average cost of capital increased in 2013 due to improving market conditions and an increased stock price in 2013 due to improving market conditions and based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 115 percent to 135 percent for most of our reporting units 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

in 2013 we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill 

a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2013 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional business unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 2013 we did not recognize any impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

stockbased compensation 

our 2005 plan provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms to employees and nonemployee directors at december 31 2013 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of longterm stock awards stock options phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 

longterm stock awards 

we grant longterm stock awards to key employees and nonemployee directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we generally continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market we measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date there was 69 million 8 million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december 31 2013 which was included as a reduction of common stock and paidin capital we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards typically five to ten years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 pretax compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was 34 million for 2013 

stock options 

we grant stock options to key employees the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than ten years after the grant date 

we measure compensation expense for stock options using a blackscholes option pricing model we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options typically five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 pretax compensation expense for stock options was 13 million for 2013 

we estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2013 riskfree interest rate – 122 dividend yield – 147 volatility factor – 4907 and expected option life – six years for expense calculation purposes the weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares granted in 2013 was 835 per option share 

if we increased our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2013 would increase by 42 percent if we lowered our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2013 would decrease by 52 percent 

employee retirement plans 

effective january 1 2010 we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans as a result of this action the liabilities for these plans were remeasured in addition certain assumptions appropriate for ongoing plans eg turnover mortality and compensation increases have been modified or eliminated for the remeasurement 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in 

these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2013 we increased our discount rate for obligations to an average of 440 percent from 380 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans liabilities matched to the december 31 2013 towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 175 percent to 480 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 420 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 324 million at december 31 2013 from 462 million at december 31 2012 primarily due to increased asset returns as well as higher rates of return in the bond market in 2013 which decreased our longterm pension liabilities in accordance with accounting guidance the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013 and 2012 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2013 had a net gain of 136 percent compared to average gains of 12 percent for the investorforce defined benefit plan universe 

our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 163 million at december 31 2013 compared with 181 million at december 31 2012 in accordance with accounting guidance this unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2013 and 2012 

at december 31 2013 we reported a net liability of 487 million of which 163 million was related to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plans which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage aftap for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 74 percent to 82 percent 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 18 million in 2014 compared with 23 million in 2013 if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2014 pension expense would increase by 5 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 8 million in 2014 compared with 8 million in 2013 

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 60 million to 70 million in 2014 to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans 

income taxes 

the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a companys threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 372 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position 

during 2012 and 2011 objective and verifiable negative evidence such as us operating losses and significant impairment charges for us goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance as a result we recorded increases of 65 million and 89 million in the valuation allowance related to our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

a return to sustainable profitability in the us is required before we would change our judgment regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

although the recent strengthening in new home construction activity has resulted in profitability in the companys us operations in 2013 we continue to record a full valuation allowance against the us federal deferred tax assets as the company remained in a threeyear cumulative loss position throughout 2013 

it is reasonably possible that the continued improvements in our us operations could result in the objective positive evidence necessary to warrant the reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance up to approximately 550 million as early as the second half of 2014 until such time the profits from our us operations will be offset by the net operating loss carryforward resulting in a lower us effective tax rate 

the 175 million and 203 million of deferred tax assets at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively for which there is no valuation allowance recorded are anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities 

should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

other commitments and contingencies 

warranty at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage the warranty period historical experience specific to the nature frequency and average cost to service the claim along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and demographic trends 

certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals 

a majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 

we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments see note u to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings 

corporate development strategy 

our business strategy includes expanding our product leadership and implementing lean principles and product process improvements across our business units going forward we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development and greenfield locations related to certain installation and other services businesses 

as part of our strategic planning we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

in early february 2013 we determined that our danish readytoassemble cabinet business was no longer core to our longterm growth strategy and accordingly we embarked on a plan for disposition we completed the disposition of our danish cabinet business and a related danish holding company in december 2013 

see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 

maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 82 percent and 87 percent at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

on march 28 2013 the company entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion and a maturity date of march 28 2018 upon entry into the credit agreement the companys credit agreement dated as of june 21 2010 as amended with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion was terminated 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring the company to maintain a a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio as adjusted for certain items of 65 percent and b a minimum interest coverage ratio as adjusted for certain items equal to or greater than 25 to 10 the debt to total 

capitalization ratio allows the addback if incurred of up to the first 250 million of certain noncash charges including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges occurring from and after january 1 2012 that would negatively impact shareholders equity 

at december 31 2013 we had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 12 billion alternatively at december 31 2013 we could absorb a reduction to shareholders equity of approximately 770 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant we were in compliance with all credit agreement covenants and we had no borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2013 

on august 15 2013 the company repurchased and retired all of its 200 million 7125 notes on the scheduled retirement date 

we had cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits of approximately 15 billion at december 31 2013 our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

of the 15 billion and the 14 billion of cash cash investments and shortterm bank deposits we held at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 622 million and 572 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us may result in additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes the amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds principally as part of our tax planning strategies as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources we have and will continue to reduce our investments in longterm financial assets 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis 

during 2013 we paid quarterly dividends of 075 per common share 

our working capital ratio was 19 to 1 and 17 to 1 at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in the working capital ratio is primarily due to the payment of 200 million of 7125 notes in august 2013 which were included in current liabilities at december 31 2012 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 



net cash provided by operations of 645 million consisted primarily of net income adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 186 million a 42 million net change in deferred taxes and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays 

we continue to emphasize balance sheet management including working capital management and cash flow generation days sales in accounts receivable were 46 days and 47 days respectively at december 31 2013 and 2012 and days sales in inventories were 49 days and 52 days at december 31 2013 and 2012 accounts payable days were 67 days at december 31 2013 and 66 days at december 31 2012 working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable as a percent of sales was 106 percent at december 31 2013 and 121 percent at december 31 2012 

net cash used for financing activities was 382 million primarily due to the retirement of 200 million of 7125 notes due august 15 2013 107 million for cash dividends paid 34 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest and 35 million for the acquisition of our common stock to generally offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2013 

at december 31 2013 we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 226 million shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities consistent with past practice we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2014 to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs 

net cash used for investing activities was 77 million and included 126 million for capital expenditures cash provided by investing activities included primarily 27 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment 17 million from the disposition of businesses net and 15 million 

from the net sale of financial investments investing activities also include net proceeds from the sale of shortterm bank deposits of 2 million 

we invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2013 were 126 million compared with 119 million for 2012 and 151 million for 2011 for 2014 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2014 acquisitions are expected to be approximately 200 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2013 totaled 186 million compared with 214 million for 2012 and 263 million for 2011 including accelerated depreciation of 13 million 28 million and 52 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively for 2014 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2014 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 175 million amortization expense totaled 11 million 12 million and 17 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2013 were 82 billion which increased nine percent compared with 2012 excluding results from the acquisition of a small uk door business and the favorable effect of currency translation net sales increased eight percent compared with 2012 the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 



net sales for 2013 were positively affected by increased sales volume of north american cabinets such increase in cabinets was partially offset by a less favorable product mix installation and other services plumbing products paints and stains builders hardware and windows which in aggregate increased sales by approximately seven percent compared to 2012 net sales of international plumbing products and cabinets also increased sales by one percent compared to 2012 net sales for 2013 were also positively affected by selling prices which increased sales by approximately one percent net sales for 2013 were negatively affected by lower selling prices of paints and stains 

net sales for 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume of installed products north american plumbing products paints and stains builders hardware and windows which in aggregate increased sales by approximately four percent compared to 2011 net sales for 2012 were also positively 

affected by selling price increases which increased sales by approximately three percent net sales for 2012 were negatively affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet and window product lines in certain geographic areas a stronger us dollar decreased sales by one percent compared to 2011 

our gross profit margins were 276 percent 261 percent and 249 percent in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 2013 gross profit margin reflects a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as increased sales volume the 2012 gross profit margin reflects a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as increased sales volume both 2013 and 2012 reflect the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 194 percent in 2013 compared with 205 percent in 2012 and 215 percent in 2011 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2013 and 2012 reflect increased sales volume and lower business rationalization costs both 2013 and 2012 also reflect the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

operating profit loss in 2013 2012 and 2011 includes 48 million 75 million and 111 million respectively of costs and charges related to business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit loss in 2012 and 2011 includes 42 million and 450 million respectively of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets operating profit loss in 2012 and 2011 includes 77 million and 9 million respectively of net charges for litigation settlements operating profit loss in 2012 includes 8 million of net gains related to fixed asset sales operating profit loss margins as reported were 82 percent 40 percent and 30 percent in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively operating profit margins excluding the items above were 88 percent 65 percent and 50 percent in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

operating margins in 2013 and 2012 were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs increased sales volume and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

other income expense net 

other net for 2013 included gains of 11 million from financial investments net other net for 2013 also included realized foreign currency losses of 18 million and other miscellaneous items 

in 2013 in conjunction with the transaction to sell our danish readytoassemble cabinet business included in discontinued operations we also disposed of a related danish holding company this disposition triggered the settlement of loans which resulted in the recognition of 18 million of currency translation expense which is included in other income expense from continuing operations in the statement of operations 

other net for 2012 included net gains of 24 million from financial investments during 2012 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 2 million for an investment in a private equity fund other net for 2012 also included realized foreign currency losses of 2 million and other miscellaneous items 

during 2011 we recognized gains of 41 million related to the sale of trimas common stock we also recognized gains of 32 million related to distributions from private equity funds 

other net for 2011 also included realized foreign currency losses of 5 million and other miscellaneous items 

interest expense was 235 million in 2013 and 254 million in each of 2012 and 2011 

income loss and earnings loss per common share from continuing operations attributable to masco corporation 

income and diluted income per common share from continuing operations for 2013 were 282 million and 78 per common share respectively loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2012 were 53 million and 16 per common share respectively loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2011 were 394 million and 114 per common share respectively loss from continuing operations for 2012 included noncash pretax impairment charges for other intangible assets of 42 million 27 million or 08 per common share after tax loss from continuing operations for 2011 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 450 million 291 million or 84 per common share after tax 

our effective tax rate for the income loss from continuing operations was a 26 percent tax expense a 125 percent tax expense and a 10 percent tax benefit in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively compared to our normalized effective tax rate of 36 percent the variance in the effective tax rate in 2013 2012 and 2011 is due primarily to changes in the us federal valuation allowance and reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions 

outlook for the company 

we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives which include expanding our product leadership positions reducing our costs improving our installation and cabinet segments and strengthening our balance sheet in 2014 we expect new home construction and repair and remodel activity to show continued improvement in north american and internationally our focus will be to continue to maximize the benefits of this activity and maintain the positive momentum we are well positioned to grow our key brands and to gain share in our channels in 2014 our emphasis will remain on developing our pipeline of innovation improving our enterprise leverage driving a high performance culture and focusing on continuous improvement across all our operating segments

business rationalizations and other initiatives 

during the severe and prolonged downturn in our markets we took several actions focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions and other cost savings initiatives for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred net pretax costs and charges related to these initiatives of 48 million 75 million and 111 million respectively 

we continue to realize the benefits of our business rationalization and continuous improvement initiatives across the enterprise and expect to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations we do not anticipate that any costs and charges related to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will be as significant as they have been 

during 2013 our north american cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of 11 million related to the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional severance our plumbing products segment incurred costs of 16 million related to a plant consolidation and severance in our bathing systems business in north america finally we incurred 21 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives 

in early february 2013 we determined that our danish readytoassemble cabinet business was no longer core to our longterm growth strategy and accordingly we embarked on a plan for disposition this business unit had 2012 sales of approximately 250 million and an operating loss of approximately 30 million the company completed the disposition of this business and a related danish holding company in december 2013 

during 2012 our north american cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of 33 million related to the closure of its countertop manufacturing facility as a result of our strategic change to a sourcing model for countertops the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional headcount reductions our plumbing products segment incurred costs of 25 million related to a plant closure and severance in our bathing systems business in north america and a plant closure and severance in spain we also incurred 14 million in costs related to severance actions at our corporate office finally we incurred 3 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives 

during 2011 we took several actions with our north american cabinet and window businesses to exit product lines and close facilities we also incurred charges in our builders hardware business and our installation and other services segment we incurred costs and charges of 111 million related to these and other actions also during 2011 we decided to dispose of several noncore businesses in the installation and other services segment these businesses were related to commercial drywall installation millwork and framing and were classified as discontinued operations for all periods during 2012 we sold all of these businesses for net proceeds of 7 million 

based on current plans we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate 10 million in 2014 we continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges 

cabinets and related products 

sales 

net sales of cabinets and related products in 2013 increased primarily due to increased sales volume of north american and international operations and increased selling prices in north america which in the aggregate increased net sales by 14 percent compared to 2012 such increases were partially offset by a less favorable product mix in north america which reduced sales in this segment by six percent 

net sales in this segment in 2012 increased primarily due to increased sales volume of north american operations and by increased selling prices which increased sales by one percent compared to 2011 

net sales in this segment in 2011 were negatively affected by lower sales volumes of north american cabinets and the planned exit of north american readytoassemble and other noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines particle board and door product lines 

operating results

 item 1 business tableend masco corporation manufactures distributes and installs home improvement and building products with an emphasis on brandname consumer products and services holding leadership positions we are among the largest manufacturers in north america of a number of home improvement and building products including faucets cabinets architectural coatings and windows and we are one of the largest installers of insulation for new home construction we provide broad product offerings in a variety of styles and price points and distribute products through multiple channels including directly to homebuilders and wholesale and retail channels approximately 78 percent of our 2012 sales were generated by our north american operations 

in 2012 new home construction increased approximately 25 percent however with the significant decline in new home construction over the past several years the demand for new homes remains below the historic average consumer spending for big ticket home improvements continued to be depressed during the year additionally we experienced a negative mix shift for certain products with consumers demanding more valuepriced products all of these factors continue to impact our results 

throughout 2012 we have pursued four strategic initiatives to improve our performance first we are extending and expanding our product leadership positions by leveraging our brands and introducing innovative new and improved products we are gaining share in our north american plumbing business with our delta ®  peerless ®  and brizo ® brands and internationally with our hansgrohe ® products we continued to extend the delta and peerless brands to additional product categories introducing toilets in 2012 and we also pursued international opportunities for these brands in 2012 masco contractor services achieved share gains in insulation for new home construction retrofit and commercial channels behr ® paint experienced growth in the pro ® paint segment and is pursuing international opportunities milgard our manufacturer of windows in the western us and our uk window group continue to gain share in their markets 

our second strategic initiative is to improve our performance by reducing costs primarily through supply chain savings and implementing lean principles and production process improvements over the last several years we have closed 33 facilities and reduced headcount by over 31000 enabling us to achieve significant fixed cost reductions we have improved our global supply chain by leveraging our size to realize purchasing cost savings simplifying the purchasing process and coordinating logistical operations at several of our businesses we have implemented new erp systems to improve operations including customer service and inventory management and to reduce costs 

our third strategic initiative is to improve our underperforming businesses particularly our cabinet and installation businesses which were impacted by the downturn in new home construction and the reduced consumer spending for big ticket home improvement items while our cabinet businesses including our european operations continue to experience challenges in 2012 this segment significantly reduced its operating losses compared to 2011 in our installation segment we experienced significant operating profit improvement in 2012 generated by incremental new home construction activity cost reductions from lean processes leveraging of our new erp system and supply chain savings 

our fourth strategic initiative is strengthening our balance sheet through net debt reduction and maintaining strong liquidity this year we reduced our debt by approximately 400 million through the retirement of notes due in july we had approximately 14 billion of cash at december 31 2012 

we believe that we have managed our businesses successfully through the economic crisis and subsequent recession of recent years we believe that our focus on our strategic initiatives of expanding our market leadership positions reducing costs improving our underperforming businesses 

  

and strengthening our balance sheet will improve our performance and position us well as the economy recovers 

our business segments 

we report our financial results in five business segments aggregated by similarity in products and services the following table sets forth the contribution of our segments to net sales and operating profit loss for the three years ended december 31 2012 additional financial information concerning our operations by segment and by geographic regions as well as general corporate expense net as of and for the three years ended december 31 2012 is set forth in note o to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

 

  

  

  

  

 all of our operating segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for new home construction and repair and remodel activity 

cabinets and related products 

in north america we manufacture and sell valuepriced stock and semicustom assembled cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range 

  

of styles and price points to address consumer preferences we have also expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the manufacture and sale of kitchen countertops as well as an integrated bathroom vanity and countertop solution in europe we manufacture and sell assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment cabinetry these products are sold in the united states and in europe under a number of trademarks our kraftmaid ® and tvilum ® brands are sold primarily to dealers home centers and mass merchants and our merillat ®  moores™ and quality cabinets™ brands are sold primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both home improvement and new home construction cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects a significant portion of our sales for home improvement are made through home center retailers 

new home construction has declined significantly over the past several years and our cabinet segment has been particularly affected by this downturn this segment has also been negatively affected by a downturn in repair and remodel particularly by consumers who continue to defer expenditures for bigticket items and when purchasing are demanding more valuepriced products although home construction is improving and is expected to continue to improve the demand for new homes remains below the historic average the size of new homes has decreased and demand has increased for multifamily housing units which are smaller than singlefamily housing units and require fewer cabinets for the kitchen and bathrooms further consumer spending for big ticket home improvements continues to be depressed in response we have implemented a strategy to increase our sales in this segment through brand building new product introductions and product innovation we have also reviewed our cost structure which resulted in the closure of several manufacturing plants in this segment and exited our north american readytoassemble cabinet product line additionally we continue to focus on improving cabinet production efficiencies at lower volumes 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and europe is highly competitive with several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in recent years we have experienced significant competition in the form of promotional pricing discounts and new product offerings by our competitors which have impacted the segment’s results of operations we are also experiencing significant competition from foreign manufacturers particularly in our european cabinet operations in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection our north american competitors include american woodmark corporation and fortune brands home  security inc 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or for us the majority of our plumbing products are sold in north america and europe under the brand names delta ®  peerless ®  hansgrohe ®  axor ®  brizo ®  brasstech ®  bristan™ ginger ®  newport brass ®  alsons ® and plumb shop ®  our products include singlehandle and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers and valves and in 2012 we introduced toilets these products are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors that in turn sell our products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others 

other plumbing products manufactured and sold by us include products branded as aqua glass ®  mirolin ® and american shower  bath™ such brands use innovex acrylic and gelcoat for tub and shower systems bath and shower enclosure units shower trays and laundry tubs which are sold primarily to wholesale plumbing distributors and home center retailers for home improvement and new home construction in north america our spas are manufactured and sold under hot spring ®  caldera ® and other trademarks directly to independent dealers major competitors include kohler aquatic maax and jacuzzi we sell hÜppe ® shower enclosures through 

  

wholesale channels primarily in western europe heritage™ ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally sold in the united kingdom directly to selected retailers 

also included in the plumbing products segment are brass and copper plumbing system components and other plumbing specialties which are sold to plumbing heating and hardware wholesalers and to home center retailers hardware stores building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers these products are marketed in north america for the wholesale trade under the brasscraft ® and brasstech ® trademarks and for the “doityourself” consumers under the brasscraft master plumber ® and plumb shop ® trademarks and are also sold under private label 

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in north america and europe with american standard kohler moen and pfister as major brand competitors we also have several european competitors primarily in germany including friedrich grohe we face significant competition from private label products including house brands sold by certain of our customers many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressures on price particularly in the emerging markets we are entering the businesses in our plumbing products segment source products from asia and manufacture products in the united states europe and asia certain businesses in our plumbing product segment are also experiencing a shift in the mix of products we sell toward more valuepriced or opening price point products which impacts our profitability in addition to price we believe that competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation product quality product innovation and features and breadth of product offering 

a substantial portion of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc therefore we have implemented a hedging strategy to minimize the impact of this volatility legislation enacted in california vermont and maryland mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in those states federal legislation mandating a national standard for lead content in plumbing products will become effective in january 2014 faucet and water supply valve manufacturers including our plumbing product companies will be required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets and certain of our plumbing products over the last several years our delta faucet business introduced the diamond™ seal technology which reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet simplifies installation and satisfies legislation regarding the acceptable lead content in plumbing products 

installation and other services 

our installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home construction market and to a lesser extent the retrofit and commercial construction markets throughout the united states in addition to insulation we sell installed gutters afterpaint products garage doors and fireplaces the installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately eleven percent nine percent and nine percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively installed building products are supplied primarily to custom and production homebuilders by our network of branches located across the united states our distributed products include insulation insulation accessories roofing and gutters among others distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers including lumber yards from distribution centers in various parts of the united states 

there has been a significant decrease in demand in the new home construction industry over the past several years additionally the size of new homes has decreased and demand has increased for multifamily housing units such as apartments and condominiums which are often smaller than singlefamily housing units the effect of these trends has resulted in the use of less insulation in response 

  

we have expanded our ability to serve the residential retrofit and light commercial markets within the installation and other services segment we have several initiatives related to improved residential energy efficiency including retrofit installation services primarily insulation delivered directly to homeowners as well as through retailers and dealer outlets 

in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of installation service we believe that we are the largest national provider of installed insulation in the new home construction industry in the united states our competitors include several regional contractors as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards we believe that our capabilities and financial resources are substantial compared to regional and local contractors 

decorative architectural products 

we produce architectural coatings including paints primers specialty paint products stains and waterproofing products the products are sold in the united states canada china mexico and south america under the brand names behr ® and kilz ® to “doityourself” and professional customers through home centers paint stores and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 20 percent of our consolidated net sales in each of 2012 2011 and 2010 competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic sherwinwilliams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality technology and product innovation customer service and brand reputation in 2012 we enhanced our paint formulations with a zerovoc premium plus ® paint and greater stainblocking properties in our premium plus ultra ® paint 

our behr products are sold through the home depot this segment’s and our largest customer the loss of this segment’s sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint the industry has experienced cost increases for titanium dioxide as a result of surges in global demand and production capacity limitations which has impacted our operating results in this segment petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs eg for resins solvents and packaging as well as titanium dioxide which can adversely affect the segment’s results of operations 

our decorative architectural products segment also includes liberty ® and brainerd ® branded cabinet door window and other hardware which is manufactured for us and sold to home centers other retailers original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets key competitors in north america include amerock top knobs and house brands decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names delta ®  franklin brass ® and decor bathware ® to distributors home centers and other retailers competitors include moen gatco and house brands sold by certain of our customers

 item 1a risk factors tableend there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results 

  

we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity both of which remain at low levels 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodel and new home construction activity principally in north america and europe the economic decline in the past four years adversely affected our home improvement businesses persistent low levels of consumer confidence and depressed home prices and elevated levels of unemployment and underemployment have limited consumers’ discretionary spending and have made consumers reluctant to make investments in existing homes including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects the significant number of households with negative equity in their homes and more conservative residential lending practices for home equity loans often used to finance repairs and remodeling have limited the ability of consumers to finance home improvements additionally sales of existing homes which significantly impact our home improvement business continue to be below normal levels new home construction is cyclical in nature although home construction is improving and is expected to continue to improve the demand for new homes remains below the historic average and stringent standards continue to be imposed on homebuyers seeking financing 

we cannot predict the type or timing of a recovery in home improvement nor the strength of a recovery in new home construction depressed consumer spending for home improvements and continued belownormal levels of new home construction may adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position 

continued uncertainty regarding an economic recovery could result in our taking additional significant noncash charges which may reduce our financial resources and flexibility and could negatively affect our earnings and reduce shareholders’ equity 

we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to prior business combinations on our balance sheet the valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses in recent years we have recorded significant noncash impairment charges for financial investments goodwill and other intangible assets we have also recorded valuation allowances related to our deferred tax assets a further decline in the expectation of our future performance or a further deterioration in expectations regarding the timing and the extent of the recovery of new home construction and home improvement may cause us to recognize additional noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets or other longlived assets which are not determinable at this time if the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired our earnings and shareholders’ equity would be adversely affected 

further our credit agreement contains financial covenants we must comply with including covenants regarding limits on our debt to total capitalization ratio if we are required to record additional noncash impairment charges our shareholders’ equity would be reduced and our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement may be limited in the past we have negotiated amendments to our credit agreement to allow for the addback to shareholders’ equity for impairment charges we have taken there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend our credit agreement that alternative financing would be available on acceptable terms and at acceptable rates or that we would be permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 

  

if we do not maintain strong brands or respond to changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices we could lose share and our results could be adversely affected 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products while we continue to invest in brand building and brand awareness these initiatives may not be successful the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling these products may impact the success of our product introductions if our new or improved products do not gain widespread acceptance we could lose share which could negatively impact our operating results 

further the volatile and challenging economic environment of recent years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our customers such shifts have altered the quantity type and prices of products demanded by the endconsumer and our customers for example the size of new homes has decreased and demand has increased for multifamily housing units such as apartments and condominiums which are often smaller than singlefamily housing units the effect of these trends has resulted in smaller kitchens and smaller and fewer bathrooms each with fewer cabinets and faucets as well as the use of less insulation we have experienced a negative mix shift for certain products with consumers demanding more valuepriced products and fewer higher margin products all of these shifts have negatively impacted our sales and profitability and it is uncertain whether these shifts represent longterm changes in consumer preferences 

consumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and enhance their purchasing and ownership experience for these products ecommerce is a rapidly developing area and development of a successful ecommerce strategy involves significant time and resources if we are unable to successfully execute our ecommerce strategies our brands may lose share 

if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices our relationships with our customers could be harmed the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

our actions to improve our underperforming businesses have been costly and may not be effective 

the downturn in home improvement and new home construction activity in the past four years has impacted our results particularly in our cabinets and related products and our installation and other services segments and in our european cabinet businesses further the economic decline has also negatively affected certain businesses in our plumbing products segment there is no assurance that our efforts to improve these underperforming businesses through initiatives to reduce costs and increase sales will be successful our costsaving initiatives including rationalizing our businesses closing plants reducing headcount and implementing new systems have been complex timeconsuming and expensive the consolidation of our north american cabinet businesses in particular has involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and information technology platforms if we cannot successfully implement these costsaving initiatives we may not fully achieve their anticipated benefits 

our strategy to increase our sales in the cabinets and related products segment through brand building new product introductions and product innovation requires time to develop implement and assess further this segment faces significant pricing and promotional pressures we have also taken several actions to improve the operations of our european cabinet businesses if we cannot successfully implement these initiatives at all of our cabinet businesses our results of operations may continue to be negatively impacted 

  

further if the eventual economic recovery is fastpaced and robust we may not be able to ramp up our reduced manufacturing and installation capacity in a timely fashion and our ability to respond to increased demand could be limited which could result in lost share and ultimately could negatively impact our operating results 

we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or exited the business in 2012 sales to our largest customer the home depot were 21 billion approximately 28 percent of consolidated net sales lowe’s is our second largest customer in 2012 sales to lowe’s were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales these home center customers may reduce the number of vendors they purchase from and can make significant changes in their volume of purchases additionally home centers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services our cost of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business although homebuilders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowe’s would have a material adverse effect on our business 

as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur which could impact our results of operations in addition we may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our customers in addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale 

we face significant competition 

our products and services face significant competition and this competition is further intensified during economic downturns we believe that we compete on the basis of price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features and innovation some home centers are increasing their purchases of select products in our segments directly from lowcost foreign manufacturers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise additionally home centers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly marketing directly to professional contractors and installers which may impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers 

in our other distribution channels we compete with foreign manufacturers in a variety of our product groups these foreign manufacturers are putting downward pressures on price particularly in the emerging markets we are entering in our cabinets and related products segment we have experienced significant competition in the form of promotional pricing discounts and new product offerings by our competitors which have impacted our results of operations in some of our segments we are also experiencing a shift in the mix of products we sell toward more valuepriced or opening price point products which may impact our ability to maintain or gain share and our profitability 

our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries and to grow our businesses depends upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies and entering new geographic areas including successful international penetration capitalizing on and strengthening our brands managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and developing and innovating products none of which is assured 

  

increased commodity costs and limited availability of commodities could affect our operating results 

we buy various commodities to manufacture our products including among others wood brass made of copper and zinc titanium dioxide and resins fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products further increases in energy costs not only increase our production costs but also the cost to transport our products each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we may receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services 

to reduce the price volatility associated with certain anticipated commodity purchases we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps we may incur net substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers and manufacturers and the loss of a key supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results 

our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of products and components from manufacturers and other suppliers we rely heavily or in certain cases exclusively on outside suppliers for some of our products and key components failure by our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results resourcing these products and components to another supplier could take time and involve significant costs accordingly the loss of a key supplier or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operating results 

further we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain our operating results could be negatively affected 

international political monetary economic and social developments affect our business 

over 20 percent of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally the euro and the british pound sterling increased international sales make up an important part of our future strategic plans in addition we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia our international business faces risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws and regulations affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad 

  

including tax laws laws regulating various business practices and trade regulations which may include duties and tariffs can also impact our international business our international operating results may be influenced by economic conditions in europe including uncertainty regarding the european sovereign debt crisis and competitive pricing pressures on certain products the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 

we have investments in financial assets including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 

we continue to reduce our investment in private equity funds since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are from time to time involved in various claims litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us these matters may include contract disputes automobile liability and other personal injury claims warranty disputes environmental claims or proceedings other tort claims employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation including class actions 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend or manage also we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability and wage and hour issues we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases due to their scope and complexity however these lawsuits can be particularly costly to defend and resolve and we have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of these types of lawsuits 

increasingly our homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities these claims often asserted several years after completion of construction can result in complex lawsuits or claims against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including us and may require us to incur defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to 

  

fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see note t to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

compliance with government regulation and industry standards could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 

we are subject to us and foreign government regulations particularly those pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers climate disruption and environmental issues in addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with these regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing which could adversely impact our competitive position further if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our operating results could be negatively affected 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel who have the experience knowledge and expertise to successfully implement our key business strategies particularly our international business expansion and the development of ecommerce capabilities we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results further as the housing market recovers if we are unable to recruit train and retain sufficient skilled labor we may not be able to adequately satisfy increased demand for our products and services which could impact our operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “assume” “seek” “appear” “may” “should” “will” “forecast” and similar references to future periods these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements in addition to the various factors included in the “executive level overview” “critical accounting policies and estimates” and “outlook for the company” sections our future performance may be affected by our reliance on new home construction and home improvement our reliance on key customers the cost and availability of raw materials shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices our ability to improve our underperforming businesses and our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a “risk “factors” of this report any forwardlooking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date on which it was made factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

executive level overview 

we manufacture distribute and install home improvement and building products these products are sold for home improvement and new home construction through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer 

2012 results net sales were positively affected by increased new home construction and repair and remodel except for big ticket items in the us partially offset by slowing economic conditions in europe and a stronger us dollar our results of operations were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and most of our businesses were positively affected by the benefits associated with the business rationalizations and cost savings initiatives that we have implemented over the last several years 

our cabinets and related products segment continues to be negatively affected by continuing competitive market conditions in repair and remodel in the us and softness in europe our plumbing products segment results were positively affected by the benefits of increased sales volume of our north american operations partially offset by lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix related to our international operations the decorative architectural products segment was positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and lower program costs the installation and other services segment was positively affected by increased sales volume the other specialty products segment was positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs partially offset by the exit of certain geographies the other specialty products segment was also negatively affected by incremental warranty expenses of 12 million and the impairment of a registered trademark of 42 million 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments in addition we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred bad debt expense related to customer defaults our bad debt expense was 14 million 12 million and 18 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

inventories 

we record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

financial investments 

we follow accounting guidance that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities this guidance defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” further it defines a fair value hierarchy as follows level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data and level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 

  

if applicable we record investments in availableforsale securities at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax effect through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 

in the past we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7 28 or 35 days at december 31 2012 our investment in auction rate securities was 22 million we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007 the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated on a recurring basis using a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately 1 million 

we have maintained investments in a number of private equity funds which aggregated 69 million at december 31 2012 we carry our investments in private equity funds and other private investments at cost it is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private investments because there are no quoted market prices and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund these investments are evaluated on a nonrecurring basis for potential otherthantemporary impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment due to the significant unobservable inputs the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a level 3 input 

impairment indicators we consider include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates industry and sector performance current equity and credit market conditions and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund including industry and sector performance the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential otherthantemporary impairment include current economic conditions market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in residential and commercial construction biotechnology health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds’ investments operate 

at december 31 2012 we have investments in 15 venture capital funds with an aggregate carrying value of 16 million the venture capital funds invest in startup or smaller earlystage established businesses principally in the information technology biotechnology and health care sectors at december 31 2012 we also have investments in 21 buyout funds with an aggregate carrying value of 53 million the buyout funds invest in laterstage established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 

since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments the timing of distributions from the funds which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments as well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash can be difficult to predict as a result the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 

we record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by accounting guidance our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information including fiveyear forecasts is available 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and estimated repair and remodel activity 

in 2012 we utilized estimated housing starts from independent industry sources growing from current levels to 15 million units in 2017 terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical levels for those business units by 2017 terminal growth year we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 95 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows in 2012 due to market conditions and based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 11 percent to 13 percent for most of our reporting units 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

in 2012 we did not recognize any noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill 

a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2012 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional business unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 

  

2012 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets of 42 million 27 million after tax attributable to our other specialty products segment 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

stockbased compensation 

our 2005 plan provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms to employees and nonemployee directors at december 31 2012 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of longterm stock awards stock options phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 

longterm stock awards 

we grant longterm stock awards to key employees and nonemployee directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we generally continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market we measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date there was 72 million 8 million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december 31 2012 which was included as a reduction of common stock and paidin capital effective january 1 2010 the vesting period for stock awards awarded after january 1 2010 is five years for stock awards granted prior to january 1 2006 we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards typically five to ten years or for executive grantees that are or will become retirementeligible during the vesting period we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement effective january 1 2006 we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards typically five to ten years except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older which vest over five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 pretax compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was 35 million for 2012 

stock options 

we grant stock options to key employees the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than ten years after the grant date 

we measure compensation expense for stock options using a blackscholes option pricing model we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options typically five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 pretax compensation expense for stock options was 15 million for 2012 

we estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2012 riskfree interest rate – 109 dividend yield – 257 volatility factor – 5097 and expected option life – six years for expense calculation purposes the weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares granted in 2012 was 444 per option share 

if we increased our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2012 would increase by 44 percent if we lowered our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2012 would decrease by 55 percent 

  

employee retirement plans 

effective january 1 2010 we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans as a result of this action the liabilities for these plans were remeasured in addition certain assumptions appropriate for ongoing plans eg turnover mortality and compensation increases have been modified or eliminated for the remeasurement 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2012 we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of 380 percent from 440 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the december 31 2012 towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 175 percent to 450 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 340 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 462 million at december 31 2012 from 439 million at december 31 2011 primarily due to lower rates of return in the bond market in 2012 in accordance with accounting guidance the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 and 2011 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2012 had a net gain of approximately 17 percent compared to average gains of 13 percent for the investor force defined benefit plan universe 

our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 181 million at december 31 2012 compared with 174 million at december 31 2011 in accordance with accounting guidance this unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 and 2011 

at december 31 2012 we reported a net liability of 643 million of which 181 million was related to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plans which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage “aftap” for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 71 percent to 84 percent 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 23 million in 2013 compared with 27 million in 2012 if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2013 pension expense would increase by 4 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 8 million in 2013 compared with 9 million in 2012 

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 50 million to 60 million in 2013 to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans 

  

income taxes 

the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a company’s threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 372 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position 

during 2012 and 2011 objective and verifiable negative evidence such as us operating losses and significant impairment charges for us goodwill in 2011 and other intangible assets continued to outweigh positive evidence necessary to reduce the valuation allowance as a result we recorded increases of 65 million and 89 million in the valuation allowance related to our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

recording the valuation allowance does not restrict our ability to utilize the future deductions and net operating losses associated with the deferred tax assets assuming taxable income is recognized in future periods 

a rebound in the us housing market from the recent historic lows and retail sales of building products improving from their current levels should have a positive impact on our operating results in the us a return to sustained profitability in the us should result in objective positive evidence thereby warranting the potential reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance 

the 203 million and 156 million of deferred tax assets at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively for which there is no valuation allowance recorded are anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities 

should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional 

  

provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

other commitments and contingencies 

warranty at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for the estimated cost to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon the information available and includes a number of factors such as the warranty coverage the warranty period historical experience specific to the nature frequency and average cost to service the claim along with product manufacturing metrics and industry and demographic trends 

certain factors and related assumptions in determining our warranty liability involve judgments and estimates and are sensitive to changes in the aforementioned factors we believe that the warranty accrual is appropriate however actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates thereby requiring adjustments to previously established accruals 

a majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 

we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments see note t to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings 

corporate development strategy 

our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units including consolidations and increasing synergies among our business units going forward we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development and greenfield locations related to certain installation and other services businesses 

as part of our strategic planning we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy as a result during 2012 we sold several business units in the installation and other services segment these businesses were related to commercial drywall installation millwork and framing accordingly we accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in 2012 and 2011 see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 

maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies as a result we have cash of approximately 14 billion at december 31 2012 our total 

  

debt as a percent of total capitalization was 87 percent and 84 percent at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

we maintain a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion and a maturity date of january 10 2014 the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries in us dollars european euros and certain other currencies 

we have entered into two amendments of the credit agreement the amendments provided for the addback to shareholders’ equity in our debt to capitalization covenant of certain noncash charges changes to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense and certain future noncash charges the second amendment also revised the permitted ratio of consolidated ebitda to the consolidated interest expense to 225 to 100 through december 31 2012 increasing to 250 to 100 with respect to each quarter thereafter 

at december 31 2012 we had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 873 million alternatively at december 31 2012 we could absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately 470 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant we were in compliance with all credit agreement covenants and we had no borrowings under the credit agreement at december 31 2012 

on march 5 2012 we issued 400 million of 595 notes due march 15 2022 “the notes” including the interest rate swap amortization the effective interest rate for the notes is approximately 65 the notes are senior indebtedness and are redeemable at the company’s option 

in january 2012 we repurchased 46 million of 5875 notes due july 15 2012 in openmarket transactions we paid a premium of 1 million for the repurchase in july 2012 we retired all of our 745 million of 5875 notes on the scheduled retirement date 

we had cash and cash investments of approximately 14 billion at december 31 2012 our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

of the 14 billion and the 17 billion of cash and cash investments we held at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 572 million and 551 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us may result in additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes the amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds principally as part of our tax planning strategies as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses we determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid availableforsale and marketable securities to balance risk since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources we have and will continue to reduce our investments in longterm financial assets 

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to debt issuances we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis 

during 2012 we paid quarterly dividends of 075 per common share 

  

our working capital ratio was 17 to 1 and 15 to 1 at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in the working capital ratio is primarily due to the payment of 791 million of 5875 notes in july 2012 which were included in current liabilities at december 31 2011 partially offset by the shortterm classification of 200 million notes due august 2013 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 

 

 our cash and cash investments decreased 305 million to 1351 million at december 31 2012 from 1656 million at december 31 2011 

net cash provided by operations of 281 million consisted primarily of net loss adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 214 million a 42 million charge for the impairment of other intangible assets a 50 million net change in deferred taxes and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays 

we continue to emphasize balance sheet management including working capital management and cash flow generation days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days at both december 31 2012 and 2011 and days sales in inventories were 52 days at both december 31 2012 and 2011 accounts payable days were 66 days at december 31 2012 and 63 days at december 31 2011 the increase in payable days is due to our improved management of accounts payable working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable as a percent of sales was 121 percent at december 31 2012 and 122 percent at december 31 2011 

net cash used for financing activities was 576 million primarily due to the retirement of 791 million of 5875 notes due july 15 2012 107 million for cash dividends paid 25 million for the settlement of interest rate swaps and 8 million for the acquisition of our common stock to generally offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2012 partially offset by the issuance of notes for 396 million net of issuance costs 

  

at december 31 2012 we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 24 million shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities consistent with past practice we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2013 to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs 

net cash used for investing activities was 27 million and included 119 million for capital expenditures cash provided by investing activities included primarily 67 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and 40 million from the net sale of financial investments 

we invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2012 were 119 million compared with 151 million for 2011 and 137 million for 2010 for 2013 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2013 acquisitions are expected to be approximately 165 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2012 totaled 214 million compared with 263 million for 2011 and 279 million for 2010 for 2013 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2013 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 210 million amortization expense totaled 12 million 17 million and 18 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with gaap in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2012 were 77 billion which increased four percent compared with 2011 excluding results from acquisitions and the negative effect of currency translation net sales increased five percent compared with 2011 the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 

 

 net sales for 2012 were positively affected by increased sales volume of installed products north american plumbing products paints and stains builders’ hardware and windows which in aggregate 

  

increased sales by approximately four percent compared to 2011 net sales for 2012 were also positively affected by selling price increases which increased sales by approximately three percent net sales for 2012 were negatively affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet and window product lines in certain geographic areas a stronger us dollar decreased sales by two percent compared to 2011 

net sales for 2011 were adversely affected by lower sales volume of installed products cabinets paints and stains builders’ hardware and windows which in aggregate reduced sales by approximately three percent compared to 2010 net sales for 2011 were also adversely affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet product lines which reduced sales by approximately two percent compared to 2010 such declines were partially offset by selling price increases primarily related to plumbing products and paints and stains which increased sales by approximately three percent a weaker us dollar increased sales by one percent compared to 2010 

our gross profit margins were 252 percent 239 percent and 245 percent in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the 2012 gross profit margin reflects a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as increased sales volume the decrease in the 2011 gross profit margin reflects lower sales volume and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs both 2012 and 2011 reflect the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 202 percent in 2012 compared with 212 percent in 2011 and 213 percent in 2010 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2012 reflect increased sales volume and lower business rationalization costs selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2011 reflect increased expenses related to growth initiatives offset by lower business rationalization expenses both 2012 and 2011 reflect the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives

operating margins in 2012 were positively affected by a more favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs increased sales volume and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

operating margins in 2011 were negatively affected by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs a less favorable product mix and increased expenses related to growth initiatives such decreases more than offset lower business rationalization costs and the benefits associated with such expenses 

other income expense net 

other net for 2012 included gains of 24 million from financial investments net during 2012 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 2 million for an investment in a private equity fund other net for 2012 also included realized foreign currency losses of 2 million and other miscellaneous items

our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations was a 198 percent tax expense a 10 percent tax benefit and a 32 percent tax expense in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively compared to our normalized effective tax rate of 36 percent the variance in the effective tax rate in 2012 2011 and 2010 is due primarily to changes in the us federal valuation allowance reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions and intangible asset impairment charges providing no tax benefit 

outlook for the company 

we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives which include expanding our product leadership positions reducing our costs improving our installation and cabinet segments and strengthening our balance sheet we believe these initiatives coupled with the actions we have taken over the past several years should position us for improved results in 2013 and continue to believe that we will outperform as new home construction and repair and remodel recover

business rationalizations and other initiatives 

over the past several years we have been focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions system implementations and other cost savings initiatives for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we incurred net pretax costs and charges related to these initiatives of 78 million 121 million and 208 million respectively 

during 2012 our north american cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of 33 million related to the closure of its countertop manufacturing facility as a result of our strategic change to a sourcing model for countertops the closure of a cabinet components facility and additional headcount reductions our plumbing products segment incurred costs of 25 million related to a plant closure and severance in our bathing systems business in north america and a plant closure and severance in spain we also incurred 14 million in costs related to severance actions at our corporate office finally we incurred 6 million of costs and charges across our business units related to other cost savings initiatives

in 2010 we took several actions within the cabinets and related products segment to rationalize our north american manufacturers including closing plants exiting product lines and integrating our builder and retail cabinet groups we incurred costs and charges of 171 million in 2010 related to these actions 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we decided to dispose of several noncore businesses in the installation and other services segment these businesses were related to commercial drywall installation millwork and framing and were classified as discontinued operations for all periods during 2012 we sold all of these businesses for net proceeds of 7 million 

based on current plans we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate 40 million in 2013 we continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges 

in early february 2013 we determined that our danish readytoassemble cabinet business was no longer core to our longterm growth strategy and accordingly we embarked on a plan for disposition this business unit had 2012 sales of approximately 250 million and an operating loss of approximately 30 million the disposition is expected to be completed within the next 12 months 

  

cabinets and related products 

sales 

net sales of cabinets and related products decreased primarily due to lower sales volume of international operations which decreased sales by three percent from 2011 such declines were partially offset by increased sales volume of north american operations and by increased selling prices which increased sales by one percent compared to 2011 a stronger us dollar decreased sales in this segment by two percent in 2012 compared to 2011 

net sales in this segment decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower sales volumes of north american cabinets which reduced sales by approximately four percent compared to 2010 sales in this segment in 2011 were also negatively affected by the planned exit of north american readytoassemble and other noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines particle board and door product lines which reduced sales by approximately 11 percent compared to 2010 sales were also negatively affected by lower sales volume of international cabinets which reduced sales in this segment by approximately two percent compared to 2010 a weaker us dollar increased sales by one percent in 2011 compared to 2010

operating margins in this segment in 2011 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses including benefits related to the integration of the north american cabinet businesses such increases were partially offset by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs aggressive promotional activity and lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs 

operating margins in this segment in 2010 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs which reduced operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points operating profit margins in this segment in 2010 were also negatively affected by increased business rationalization expenses and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs such decreases more than offset the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives

operating margins in this segment in 2010 were positively affected by a more favorable product mix and the positive relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

installation and other services 

sales 

net sales in the installation and other services segment increased in 2012 primarily due to increased sales volume related to a higher level of activity in the new home construction market and increased commercial sales 

net sales in this segment increased in 2011 primarily due to increased distribution sales increased selling prices and increased retrofit and commercial sales such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of installed products related to a continued decline in the new home construction market the downward trend in the size and content of new houses in early 2011 and the increased multifamily construction we gained share in singlefamily construction 

net sales in this segment decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower sales volume related to reduced share in the new home construction market sales in this segment were also negatively affected by a downward trend in the size and content of new houses being constructed by our builder customers

net sales in this segment decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower sales volume of windows in north america due to the expiration of the energy tax credit in 2010 and the uk partially offset by increased selling prices and increased sales related to new product introductions and geographic expansion a weaker us dollar increased sales in this segment by one percent compared to 2010 

net sales in this segment increased in 2010 primarily due to increased sales volume of windows in north america principally related to the energysavings tax credit which expired at the end of 2010 and increased sales volume of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools

our business segments

 all of our operating segments except the plumbing products segment normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters corresponding with the peak season for new home construction and repair and remodel activity 

cabinets and related products 

in north america we manufacture and sell valuepriced stock and semicustom assembled cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points to address consumer preferences we have also expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the manufacture and sale of kitchen countertops as well as an integrated bathroom vanity and countertop solution in europe we manufacture and sell assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment cabinetry these products are sold in the united states and in europe under a number of trademarks including kraftmaid ®  tvilum ® and woodgate ® primarily to dealers and home centers and under the merillat ®  moores™ and quality cabinets™ brands primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home improvement and new home construction markets cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects a significant portion of our sales for the home improvement market are made through home center retailers 

new home construction has declined over 70 percent during the last six years and this segment has been particularly affected by this downturn this segment has also been negatively affected by a downturn in the repair and remodel market particularly by consumers deferring expenditures for bigticket items in response we have closed several manufacturing plants in this segment and in 2011 we idled two additional facilities and completed the exit of our north american readytoassemble cabinet product line additionally we continue to be focused on improving cabinet production efficiencies at lower volumes we completed the common architecture platform for our merillat ® and quality cabinets™ brands in 2011 which we believe will enhance our manufacturing flexibility lastly we have completed the integration of our builder cabinet group and retail cabinet group to form masco cabinetry and we are beginning to realize cost savings from the integration 

  

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and europe is highly competitive with several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in 2011 we experienced greater promotional pricing activity in this segment which impacts the segment’s results of operations in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection our significant north american competitors include american woodmark corporation and fortune brands home  security inc 

plumbing products 

the businesses in our plumbing products segment sell a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or for us the majority of our plumbing products are sold in north america and europe under the brand names delta ®  peerless ®  hansgrohe ®  axor ®  brizo ®  brasstech ®  bristan tm  ginger ®  newport brass ®  alsons ® and plumb shop ®  our products include singlehandle and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers and valves which are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors who in turn sell our products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others 

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in the north american and european markets with american standard kohler moen and pfister as major brand competitors we also have several european competitors primarily in germany including friedrich grohe we face significant competition from private label products including house brands sold by certain of our customers many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured in asia the businesses in our plumbing products segment source products from asia and manufacture products in the united states europe and asia 

other plumbing products manufactured and sold by us include products branded as aqua glass ®  mirolin ®  american shower  bath™ and innovex ® acrylic and gelcoat tub and shower systems bath and shower enclosure units shower trays and laundry tubs which are sold primarily to wholesale plumbing distributors and home center retailers for the north american home improvement and new home construction markets our spas are manufactured and sold under hot spring ®  caldera ® and other trademarks directly to independent dealers major competitors include kohler lasco maax and jacuzzi we sell hÜppe ® shower enclosures through wholesale channels primarily in western europe heritage™ ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally sold in the united kingdom directly to selected retailers 

also included in the plumbing products segment are brass and copper plumbing system components and other plumbing specialties which are sold to plumbing heating and hardware wholesalers and to home center retailers hardware stores building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers these products are marketed in north america for the wholesale trade under the brasscraft ® and brasstech ® trademarks and for the “doityourself” market under the master plumber ® and plumb shop ® trademarks and are also sold under private label 

in addition to price we believe that competition in our plumbing products markets is based largely on brand reputation product quality product innovation and features and breadth of product offering 

a substantial portion of our plumbing products contain brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have encountered price volatility for brass brass components and any components containing copper and zinc therefore we have implemented a hedging strategy to minimize the impact of this volatility legislation enacted in california vermont and maryland mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in those states federal legislation mandating a national standard for lead content in plumbing products will become effective in january 2014 faucet and water supply valve manufacturers including our plumbing product companies will be required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets and certain of our plumbing products over the 

  

last several years our delta faucet business introduced the diamond™ seal technology which reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet simplifies installation and satisfies legislation regarding the acceptable lead content in plumbing products 

installation and other services 

our installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home construction market and to a lesser extent the retrofit and commercial construction markets throughout the united states in addition to insulation we sell installed gutters afterpaint products fireplaces and garage doors the installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately nine percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 installed building products are supplied primarily to custom and production homebuilders by our network of branches located across the united states distributed products include insulation insulation accessories gutters fireplaces and roofing distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers including lumber yards from distribution centers in various parts of the united states 

in order to respond to the significant decrease in demand in the new home construction industry over the past several years we have implemented various cost savings initiatives including the consolidation and closure of approximately 110 branch locations this rationalization has been accomplished while maintaining our strategic presence in most of the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas in the united states in addition we have deemphasized the installation of certain noninsulation building products that are not core to our service offering including windows and paint in 2011 we announced the decision to divest four noncore businesses in this segment that offered commercial drywall installation millwork and framing services we also completed the implementation of an erp system which we anticipate will enable us to achieve future efficiencies through the automation of manual processes and to provide superior customer service to our customers 

also in response to the depressed new home construction market we have expanded our ability to serve the residential retrofit and light commercial markets within the installation and other services segment we have several initiatives related to improved residential energy efficiency including retrofit installation services primarily insulation delivered directly to homeowners as well as through retailers and dealer outlets 

in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of installation service we believe that we are the largest national provider of installed insulation in the new home construction industry in the united states our competitors include several regional contractors as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards we believe that our capabilities and financial resources are substantial compared to regional and local contractors 

decorative architectural products 

we produce architectural coatings including paints primers specialty paint products stains and waterproofing products the products are sold in the united states canada china mexico and south america under the brand names behr ®  kilz ® and behr expressions ® to “doityourself” and professional customers through home centers paint stores and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 20 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic sherwinwilliams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality technology and product innovation customer service and brand reputation recently our competitors have begun to offer combined paint and primer products similar to behr’s premium plus ultra paint which we introduced in 2009 

  

our behr products are sold through the home depot the segment’s and our largest customer the paint departments at the home depot stores include the behr color center and computer kiosk with the color smart by behr ® computerized colormatching system that enables consumers to select and coordinate their paintcolor selection the loss of this segment’s sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint the industry continues to experience cost increases for titanium dioxide as a result of surges in global demand and production capacity limitations which has impacted our operating results in this segment petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs eg for resins solvents and packaging as well as titanium dioxide which can adversely affect the segment’s results of operations 

our decorative architectural products segment also includes liberty ® and brainerd ® branded cabinet door window and other hardware which is manufactured for us and sold to home centers other retailers original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets key competitors in north america include amerock top knobs direct import hickory hardware and stanley black  decker decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names delta ®  franklin brass ® and decor bathware ® to distributors home centers and other retailers competitors include moen and gatco

in the united kingdom we manufacture and sell windows related products and components under several brand names including griffin™ cambrian™ premier™ and duraflex™ sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the repair and remodeling markets although our duraflex products are also sold to other window fabricators united kingdom competitors include many small and midsized firms and a few large vertically integrated competitors in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and product quality 

we manufacture and sell a complete line of manual and electric staple gun tackers staples and other fastening tools under the brand names arrow ® and powershot ®  we sell these products through various distribution channels including home centers and other retailers and wholesalers our principal north american competitor in this product line is stanley black  decker

 item 1a risk factors tableend there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity levels both of which are experiencing a prolonged and substantial downturn 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodel and new home construction activity levels principally in north america and europe the current economic decline has adversely affected our home improvement businesses continued low levels of consumer confidence high levels of unemployment and the downward pressure on home prices have limited consumers’ discretionary spending and have made consumers reluctant to make additional investments in existing homes including large kitchen and bath remodeling projects the increasing number of households with negative equity in their homes and more conservative residential lending practices for home equity loans that are often used to finance repairs and remodeling are limiting the ability of consumers to finance home improvements additionally sales of existing homes which significantly impact our home improvement business have decreased significantly in the past few years 

new home construction which is cyclical in nature is experiencing a prolonged and substantial downturn marked by continued softness in the demand for new homes an oversupply of existing 

  

homes on the market and more stringent standards for homebuyers seeking financing the oversupply of existing homes held for sale is exacerbated by slower household formation growth rates the significant number of short sales and home mortgage foreclosures as well as uncertainties in the home foreclosure process all of which continue to contribute to the downward pressure on home prices further the expiration or scaling back of homebuyer tax credits and other government programs has also negatively impacted home sales it is uncertain when and to what extent these trends and factors might reverse or improve 

although we believe that the longterm outlook for home improvement and new home construction is favorable we cannot predict the type timing or strength of a recovery in these areas the large number of borrowers who remain at risk of potentially losing their homes through foreclosures or short sales coupled with the voluntary and involuntary halts of foreclosure proceedings by lenders due to legal challenges could prolong the downturn in home improvement and new home construction activity prolonged depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvements and new home construction will continue to adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position and may disproportionately affect our business segments that are most heavily dependent on new home construction and large consumer investments in home remodeling projects 

the prolonged economic downturn could result in our taking additional significant noncash charges which may reduce our financial resources and flexibility and could negatively affect our earnings and reduce shareholders’ equity 

we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to prior business combinations on our balance sheet the valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses in recent years we have recorded significant noncash impairment charges for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible assets we have also recorded a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets a further decline in the expectation of our future performance or a further deterioration in expectations regarding the timing and the extent of the recovery of the new home construction and home improvement segments may cause us to recognize additional noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets or other longlived assets which are not determinable at this time if the value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired our earnings and shareholders’ equity would be adversely affected 

further our credit agreement contains financial covenants we must comply with including covenants regarding limits on our debt to total capitalization ratio if we are required to record additional noncash impairment charges which would reduce our shareholders’ equity our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement may be limited we recently amended our credit agreement to allow for the addback to shareholders’ equity for impairment charges we have taken there can be no assurance that we would be able to further amend the credit agreement in the future or that alternative financing would be available on acceptable terms and at acceptable rates or that we would be permitted to obtain alternative financing under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 

if we do not maintain strong brands develop new products or respond to changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices our results could be adversely affected 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products we have increased our focus on investment in brand building and brand awareness as well as new product development and product innovation the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new and improved products such as gauging changing consumer preferences and successfully developing manufacturing marketing and selling new or improved products may impact the success of our new product introductions if our new products do not gain widespread market acceptance we could lose market share which could negatively impact our operating results 

  

further the volatile and challenging economic environment of recent years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our customers for example the size of new homes has decreased and demand has increased for multifamily housing units such as apartments and condominiums which are often smaller than singlefamily housing units the effect of these trends has resulted in smaller kitchens and smaller and fewer bathrooms each with fewer cabinets and faucets as well as the use of less insulation such shifts which may or may not be longterm have altered the quantity type and prices of products demanded by the endconsumer and our customers additionally consumers are increasingly using the internet and mobile technology to research home improvement products and enhance their purchasing experience for these products if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences and purchasing practices our relationships with our customers could be harmed the demand for our products could be reduced and our market share could be negatively affected 

our response to the prolonged economic downturn has been to continue our focus on implementation of costsavings initiatives which have been costly and may not be effective 

during the current downturn in home improvement and new home construction we have focused on costsaving initiatives including rationalizing our businesses particularly the consolidation of our cabinet businesses as well as plant closures headcount reductions and system implementations 

the consolidation of our cabinet businesses has involved the integration of multiple manufacturing processes and information technology platforms which has been complex timeconsuming and expensive if we cannot successfully implement this consolidation or our other costsavings initiatives or if it becomes more expensive to make future costsavings changes we may not fully achieve the anticipated benefits from these initiatives further if we do not effectively balance our focus on cost savings with the need to maintain a strong sales presence for our brands we could lose market share in the future we will need to continually evaluate our productivity to assess opportunities to reduce costs and we may incur additional costs and charges relating to further costsavings initiatives however gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time if the eventual recovery of our markets is fastpaced and robust we may not be able to replace our reduced manufacturing and installation capacity in a timely fashion and our ability to respond to increased demand could be limited which could result in lost market share and ultimately could negatively impact our operating results 

we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or exited the business larger customers can make significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services our costs of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business sales of our home improvement and building products to home centers are substantial in 2011 sales to our largest customer the home depot were 20 billion approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales lowe’s is our second largest customer in 2011 our sales to lowe’s were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales although homebuilders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowe’s would have a material adverse effect on our business 

as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur in addition we may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our customers in 

  

addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers and may diminish our ability to leverage economies of scale 

our principal markets are highly competitive 

the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive competition is further intensified during economic downturns home centers are increasing their purchases of products directly from lowcost overseas suppliers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise additionally home centers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and installers we believe that competition in our industries is based on price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features and innovation 

in addition to the challenges we have faced as a result of the economic downturn our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets including successful penetration of international markets capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and product development and innovation 

increased commodity costs and limited availability of commodities could affect our operating results 

we buy various commodities to manufacture our products including among others wood brass made of copper and zinc titanium dioxide and resins fluctuations in the availability and prices of these commodities could increase our costs to manufacture our products further increases in energy costs not only increase our production costs but also the cost to transport our products each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases to cover our increased commodity and production costs our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices if we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased commodity and production costs our financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted if we are able to increase our selling prices sustained price increases for our products may lead to sales declines and loss of market share particularly if our competitors do not increase their prices when commodity prices decline we may receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services 

to reduce the price volatility associated with certain anticipated commodity purchases we use derivative instruments including commodity futures and swaps we may incur net substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we are dependent on thirdparty suppliers and manufacturers and the loss of a key supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results 

our ability to offer a wide variety of products depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of products and components from manufacturers and other suppliers we rely heavily or in certain cases exclusively on outside suppliers for some of our products and key components failure by our suppliers to provide us quality products on commercially reasonable terms and to comply with legal requirements for business practices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or 

  

operating results although these products and components are generally obtainable in sufficient quantities from other sources resourcing them to another supplier could take time and could involve significant costs accordingly the loss of a key supplier or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operating results 

further we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain our operating results could be negatively affected 

international political monetary economic and social developments affect our business 

over 20 percent of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally the euro and the british pound sterling increased international sales make up an important part of our future strategic plans in addition we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia our international business faces risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices also impact our international business our international operating results may be influenced when compared to our north american results in part by relative economic conditions in the european markets including uncertainty regarding the european sovereign debt crisis and competitive pricing pressures on certain products the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 

we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 

we continue to reduce our investment in private equity funds since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation in addition we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 

claims and litigation could be costly 

we are from time to time involved in various claims litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us these matters may include contract disputes automobile liability and other personal injury claims warranty disputes environmental claims or proceedings other tort claims employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation including class actions 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend or manage also we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for 

  

products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

we have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability and wage and hour issues we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases due to their scope and complexity however these lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve and significant exposures have been alleged 

increasingly our homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities caused by our negligence these claims often asserted several years after completion of construction can result in complex lawsuits or claims against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including us and may require us to incur defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

see note s to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 

we are subject to us and foreign government regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers climate disruption and environmental issues in addition to complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future additionally some of our products must be certified by industry organizations compliance with these regulations and industry standards may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing which could adversely impact our competitive position further if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards our operating results could be negatively affected 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel and as we consider entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with these markets we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “assume” “seek” “appear” “may” “should” “will” “forecast” and similar references to future periods these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements in addition to the various factors included in the “executive level overview” “critical accounting policies and estimates” and “outlook for the company” sections our future performance may be affected by our reliance on new home construction and home improvement our reliance on key customers the cost and availability of raw materials shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and our ability to achieve cost savings through business rationalizations and other initiatives these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a “risk “factors” of this report any forwardlooking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date on which it was made factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

executive level overview 

we manufacture distribute and install home improvement and building products these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer 

2011 results the following is a summary of the significant factors affecting us in 2011 our cabinets and related products segment continues to be negatively affected by softness in the new home construction market and increased competitive market conditions in the repair and remodel market further the cabinets and related products segment continued to incur costs and charges related to the integration of our north american cabinet manufacturers that began in 2010 and other plant closures and consolidations including the exit of certain product lines this segment also incurred goodwill impairment charges related to our readytoassemble cabinet manufacturer in europe our plumbing products segment continues to realize increased sales volume and selling prices offset by increased commodity costs and a less favorable product mix the installation and other services segment was positively affected by increased distribution sales increased selling prices and increased retrofit and commercial sales which partially offset decreases in sales volume related to the new home construction market we also decided to divest certain operations in the installation and other services segment that are not core to our longterm growth strategy such operations have been classified as discontinued operations the decorative architectural products segment was negatively affected by lower sales volume of paints and stains due to increasingly competitive market conditions and increased commodity costs this segment also incurred goodwill impairment charges related to the builders’ hardware business unit and rationalization costs related to the exit of a builders’ hardware product line our other specialty products segment was negatively impacted by lower sales volume due to continuing weakness in our markets and increased business rationalization costs related to the closure of several facilities 

  

in 2011 we experienced increased commodity costs and the economy continued to experience a further decline in home values lack of job creation and depressed consumer confidence hindering a housing recovery all of which negatively impacted our performance during 2011 we continued to take actions to further reduce our cost structure including closing several branch locations in the installation and other services segment closing several manufacturing facilities related to our north american window manufacturer closing one manufacturing facility related to our european readytoassemble cabinet manufacturer one facility related to our north american cabinet manufacturer and continued to integrate our north american cabinet manufacturers we incurred costs and charges related to these and other actions of 121 million we believe that these actions together with actions taken over the last several years have positioned us well for the current environment and for the recovery in our markets 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivables 

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments in addition we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred bad debt expense related to customer defaults our bad debt expense was 12 million 18 million and 34 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

inventories 

we record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

  

financial investments 

we follow accounting guidance that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities this guidance defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” further it defines a fair value hierarchy as follows level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data and level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 

if applicable we record investments in availableforsale securities at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax effect through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet during 2011 and 2010 we sold all of our shares of our investment in trimas common stock for cash of 43 million and 10 million respectively 

in the past we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7 28 or 35 days at december 31 2011 our investment in auction rate securities was 22 million we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007 the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated on a recurring basis using a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately 1 million 

we have maintained investments in a number of private equity funds which aggregated 86 million at december 31 2011 we carry our investments in private equity funds and other private investments at cost it is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private investments because there are no quoted market prices and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund these investments are evaluated on a nonrecurring basis for potential otherthantemporary impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment due to the significant unobservable inputs the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a level 3 input 

impairment indicators we consider include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates industry and sector performance current equity and credit market conditions and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund including industry and sector performance the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential otherthantemporary impairment include current economic conditions market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in residential and commercial construction biotechnology health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds’ investments operate 

at december 31 2011 we have investments in 17 venture capital funds with an aggregate carrying value of 17 million the venture capital funds invest in startup or smaller earlystage established businesses principally in the information technology biotechnology and health care sectors at december 31 2011 we also have investments in 22 buyout funds with an aggregate carrying value of 69 million the buyout funds invest in laterstage established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 

  

since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments the timing of distributions from the funds which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments as well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash can be difficult to predict as a result the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 

we record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by accounting guidance our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information including fiveyear forecasts is available 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 

in 2011 we utilized estimated housing starts from independent industry sources growing from current levels to 15 million units in 2016 terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical levels for those business units by 2016 terminal growth year we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately seven percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows in 2011 due to market conditions and based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of ten percent to 15 percent for most of our reporting units 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

  

in 2011 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill aggregating 486 million 330 million after tax the pretax impairment charge of 44 million in the cabinets and related products segment relates to our european readytoassemble cabinet manufacturer and reflects the continued declining demand for certain products as well as decreased operating margins the pretax impairment charge of 75 million in the decorative architectural products segment relates to our builders’ hardware business and reflects increasing competitive conditions for this business the pretax impairment charge of 367 million in the other specialty products segment relates to our north american window and door business the charge reflects the continuing weak level of new home construction activity in the western us in 2011 the reduced levels of repair and remodel activity and the expectation that the recovery in these segments will be modestly slower than previously anticipated 

a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2011 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional business unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 2011 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets of 8 million 5 million after tax attributable to our plumbing products segment 1 million and our other specialty products segment 7 million 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

stockbased compensation 

our 2005 long term stock incentive plan the “2005 plan” provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms to employees and nonemployee directors at december 31 2011 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of longterm stock awards stock options phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 

longterm stock awards 

we grant longterm stock awards to key employees and nonemployee directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market we measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date there was 107 million ten million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december 31 2011 which was included as a reduction of common stock and paidin capital effective january 1 2010 the vesting period for stock awards awarded after january 1 2010 is five years for stock awards granted prior to january 1 2006 we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards typically five to ten years or for executive grantees that are or will become retirementeligible during the vesting period we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement effective january 1 2006 we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards typically five to ten years except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older which vest over five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 pretax compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was 39 million for 2011 

  

stock options 

we grant stock options to key employees the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than ten years after the grant date 

we measure compensation expense for stock options using a blackscholes option pricing model we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options typically five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 pretax compensation expense for stock options was 21 million for 2011 

we estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2011 riskfree interest rate – 269 dividend yield – 235 volatility factor – 4903 and expected option life – six years for expense calculation purposes the weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares granted in 2011 was 507 per option share 

if we increased our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2011 would increase by 42 percent if we lowered our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2011 would decrease by 53 percent 

employee retirement plans 

effective january 1 2010 we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans as a result of this action the liabilities for these plans were remeasured in addition certain assumptions appropriate for ongoing plans eg turnover mortality and compensation increases have been modified or eliminated for the remeasurement 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2011 we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of 440 percent from 530 percent the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the december 31 2011 towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 200 percent to 550 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 420 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 439 million at december 31 2011 from 359 million at december 31 2010 primarily due to lower rates of return in the bond market in 2011 in accordance with accounting guidance the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 and 2010 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2011 had a net loss of approximately two percent compared to average gains of one percent for the corporate funds universe within the independent consultant cooperative 

  

our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 174 million at december 31 2011 compared with 163 million at december 31 2010 this unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 and 2010 

at december 31 2011 we reported a net liability of 613 million of which 174 million was related to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plans which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006 in accordance with the pension protection act the adjusted funding target attainment percentage “aftap” for the various definedbenefit pension plans ranges from 56 percent to 80 percent at december 31 2011 we had one plan that offered accelerated benefits ie lump sum distributions and the aftap for that plan is less than 80 percent therefore the plan is prohibited from allowing participants to receive any lump sum distribution in excess of 50 percent of the benefit value in addition plan amendments increasing benefits or liabilities for that plan are also prohibited 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 26 million in 2012 compared with 23 million in 2011 if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2012 pension expense would increase by 3 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 9 million in 2012 compared with 9 million in 2011 

we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 60 million to 70 million in 2012 to our qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit plans 

income taxes 

the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a company’s threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the company can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 372 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position these factors negatively impact our ability to utilize taxplanning strategies that included the potential sale of certain noncore operating assets to support the realization of our us federal deferred tax assets since current year losses are heavily weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the carryforward period to realize the benefit of the strategies 

during 2011 objective and verifiable negative evidence such as continued us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges continued to outweigh positive evidence as a result we recorded an 89 million increase in the valuation allowance related to our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense 

  

recording the valuation allowance does not restrict our ability to utilize the future deductions and net operating losses associated with the deferred tax assets assuming taxable income is recognized in future periods 

a rebound in the us housing market from the current historic lows and retail sales of building products improving from their current levels should have a positive impact on our operating results in the us a return to sustained profitability in the us should result in objective positive evidence thereby warranting the potential reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance 

the 156 million and 228 million of deferred tax assets at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively for which there is no valuation allowance recorded are anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities 

should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

other commitments and contingencies 

certain of our products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions to the extent that we experience any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 

the majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and we record deductions at the time of sale 

we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments see note s to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings 

  

corporate development strategy 

our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units including consolidations and increasing synergies among our business units going forward we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development and greenfield locations related to certain installation and other services businesses as part of our strategic planning we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

during 2011 we determined that several business units in the installation and other services segment were no longer core to our longterm growth strategy these businesses were related to commercial drywall installation millwork and framing accordingly we have embarked on a plan of disposition for these businesses and have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in 2011 in late 2011 we acquired a small manufacturer of hot tubs in the plumbing products segment see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

liquidity and capital resources 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 

maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies such strategies have resulted in cash of approximately 17 billion at december 31 2011 our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 84 percent and 72 percent at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

on june 21 2010 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion with a maturity date of january 10 2014 the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries in us dollars european euros and certain other currencies borrowings under the revolver denominated in euros are limited to 500 million equivalent we can also borrow swingline loans up to 150 million and obtain letters of credit of up to 250 million any outstanding letters of credit reduce our borrowing capacity at december 31 2011 we had 92 million of outstanding and unused letters of credit reducing our borrowing capacity by such amount 

our revolving credit loans bear interest under the credit agreement at our option at a a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i prime rate ii the federal funds effective rate plus 050 and iii libor plus 10 the “alternative base rate” plus an applicable margin based upon the thenapplicable corporate credit ratings of the company or b libor plus an applicable margin based upon the thenapplicable corporate credit ratings of the company the foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin based upon the thenapplicable corporate credit ratings of the company 

in order to borrow under the credit agreement we must not be in default of our covenants under the credit agreement ie in addition to the debt to total capitalization covenant and a financial covenant we must meet a minimum adjusted interest coverage ratio principally limitations on subsidiary debt negative pledge restrictions legal compliance requirements and maintenance of properties and insurance and our representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects ie no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change no material erisa or environmental noncompliance and no material tax deficiency we were in compliance with all covenants and we had no borrowings at december 31 2011 

on february 11 2011 we entered into an amendment deemed to be effective and applicable as of december 31 2010 of the credit agreement the “amendment” the amendment provided for the 

  

addback to shareholders’ equity in our debt to capitalization covenant of i certain noncash charges including impairment charges for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible assets and ii changes to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense each taken in 2010 which aggregated 986 million after tax the amendment also permitted us to addback if incurred up to 350 million in the aggregate of future noncash charges subsequent to december 31 2010 

based on the limitations of the debt to total capitalization covenant before the second amendment discussed below at december 31 2011 we had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 178 million alternatively at december 31 2011 we could absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately 96 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 

on february 13 2012 we entered into another amendment deemed to be effective and applicable as of december 31 2011 of the credit agreement the “second amendment” the second amendment provides for the addback to shareholders’ equity in our debt to capitalization covenant of i certain noncash charges including impairment charges for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible assets and ii changes to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense each taken in 2010 and 2011 which aggregate 16 billion after tax the second amendment also permits us to addback if incurred up to 250 million in the aggregate of future noncash charges subsequent to december 31 2011 the second amendment also revised the permitted ratio of consolidated ebitda to the consolidated interest expense to 225 to 100 through december 31 2012 increasing to 250 to 100 with respect to each quarter thereafter 

taking the second amendment into account at december 31 2011 we had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 630 million alternatively at december 31 2011 we could absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately 340 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 

we have 791 million of fixedrate debt due july 15 2012 “notes” with an interest rate of 5875 we plan to refinance a portion of the notes in 2012 and therefore we have entered into forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge the volatility in interest payments associated with this planned debt issuance the interest rate swaps are intended to cover a notional amount of 400 million we anticipate that we will redeem the remaining notes for cash 

we had cash and cash investments of approximately 17 billion at december 31 2011 principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

of the 17 billion of cash and cash investments we held at both december 31 2011 and 2010 551 million and 493 million respectively is held in our foreign subsidiaries if these funds were needed for our operations in the us their repatriation into the us may result in additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes the amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds principally as part of our tax planning strategies as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses we determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid availableforsale and marketable securities to balance risk since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources we have and will continue to reduce our investments in longterm financial assets 

  

we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar commodity cost fluctuations primarily zinc and copper and interest rate fluctuations primarily related to our anticipated debt issuance in 2012 we review our hedging program derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis 

during 2011 we paid a quarterly dividend of 075 per common share 

our working capital ratio was 15 to 1 and 23 to 1 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the decline in the working capital ratio is primarily due to the classification to current liabilities of 791 million of 5875 notes due july 2012 

cash flows 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 

 

 our cash and cash investments decreased 59 million to 1656 million at december 31 2011 from 1715 million at december 31 2010 

net cash provided by operations of 239 million consisted primarily of net loss adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 263 million a 494 million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets a 112 million net change in deferred taxes a 86 million charge for the impairment of assets related to discontinued operations and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense and amortization expense related to instore displays 

we continue to emphasize balance sheet management including working capital management and cash flow generation days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days at both december 31 2011 and 2010 and days sales in inventories were 52 days at december 31 2011 and 49 days at december 31 2010 accounts payable days were 63 days at december 31 2011 and 51 days at december 31 2010 the increase in payable days is due to our improved management of accounts payable working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable as a percent of sales was 122 percent at december 31 2011 and 134 percent at december 31 2010 such improvement was primarily due to improved accounts payable management 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 219 million and included cash outflows of 107 million for cash dividends paid 63 million for the net payment of debt and 30 million for the acquisition of our common stock to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2011 

at december 31 2011 we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional 25 million shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities consistent with past practice we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2012 to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs 

net cash used for investing activities was 61 million and included 151 million for capital expenditures cash provided by investing activities included primarily 24 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and 94 million from the net sale of financial investments 

we invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2011 were 151 million compared with 137 million for 2010 and 125 million for 2009 for 2012 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2012 acquisitions are expected to be approximately 180 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2011 totaled 263 million compared with 279 million for 2010 and 254 million for 2009 for 2012 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2012 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 219 million amortization expense totaled 17 million 18 million and 17 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results 

sales and operations 

net sales for 2011 were 75 billion relatively flat with 2010 excluding results from acquisitions and the effect of currency translation net sales decreased one percent compared with 2010 the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 

 

   

net sales for 2011 were adversely affected by lower sales volume of installed products cabinets paints and stains builders’ hardware and windows which in aggregate reduced sales by approximately three percent compared to 2010 net sales for 2011 were also adversely affected by the planned exit of certain cabinet product lines which reduced sales by approximately two percent compared to 2010 such declines were partially offset by selling price increases primarily related to plumbing products and paints and stains which increased sales by approximately three percent a weaker us dollar increased sales by one percent compared to 2010 

net sales for 2010 were adversely affected by lower sales volume of installed products and cabinets which in aggregate reduced sales by approximately three percent compared to 2009 net sales for 2010 were also negatively affected by lower sales volume of builders’ hardware and north american plumbing products which reduced net sales by approximately one percent compared to 2009 such declines were partially offset by a more favorable product mix of plumbing products and paints and stains which increased sales by approximately one percent compared to 2009 net sales volume in 2010 of our international plumbing products and windows increased in local currencies and increased consolidated net sales by approximately one percent compared to 2009 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by one percent compared to 2009 

our gross profit margins were 239 percent 245 percent and 263 percent in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease in the 2011 gross profit margin reflects lower sales volume and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs such decreases were partially offset by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 212 percent in 2011 compared with 213 percent in 2010 and 219 percent in 2009 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2011 reflect increased expenses related to growth initiatives offset by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2010 reflect lower sales volume increased advertising expenses related to new product introductions and increased system implementation costs 

operating loss profit in 2011 2010 and 2009 includes 121 million 208 million and 94 million respectively of costs and charges related to business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating loss profit in 2011 2010 and 2009 includes 494 million 698 million and 262 million respectively of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets operating loss profit in 2011 and 2009 includes 9 million and 7 million respectively of charges for litigation settlements operating loss profit margins as reported were 40 percent 62 percent and 09 percent in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively operating profit margins excluding the items above were 44 percent 59 percent and 57 percent in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

operating margins in 2011 were negatively affected by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs a less favorable product mix and increased expenses related to growth initiatives such decreases more than offset lower business rationalization costs and the benefits associated with such expenses 

operating margins in 2010 were positively affected by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives which more than offset the negative effect of lower sales volume and the less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs 

other income expense net 

during 2011 we recognized gains of 41 million related to the sale of trimas common stock we also recognized gains of 32 million related to distributions from private equity funds 

other net for 2011 also included realized foreign currency losses of 5 million and other miscellaneous items 

  

during 2010 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 34 million related to financial investments 28 million related to asahi tec preferred stock and 6 million related to private equity funds and other private investments 

other net for 2010 included 9 million of income from financial investments net other net for 2010 also included realized foreign currency losses of 2 million and other miscellaneous items 

during 2009 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 10 million for our investments in private equity funds 

other net for 2009 included 3 million of income from financial investments net other net for 2009 also included realized foreign currency gains of 17 million and other miscellaneous items 

interest expense was 254 million 251 million and 225 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in interest expense in 2011 and 2010 is primarily due to the issuance of 500 million of 7125 notes in march 2010 

loss income and loss earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to masco corporation 

loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2011 were 465 million and 134 per common share respectively loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2010 were 1022 million and 294 per common share respectively loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2009 were 130 million and 38 per common share respectively loss from continuing operations for 2011 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 494 million 335 million or 96 per common share after tax loss from continuing operations for 2010 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 698 million 586 million or 168 per common share after tax loss from continuing operations for 2009 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 262 million 180 million or 51 per common share after tax 

our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations was a 10 percent tax benefit a 32 percent tax expense and a 32 percent tax benefit in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively compared to our normalized effective tax rate of 36 percent the variance in the effective tax rate in 2011 and 2010 is due primarily to changes in the us federal valuation allowance reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions and goodwill impairment charges providing no tax benefit 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 372 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position these factors negatively impact our ability to utilize previously identified taxplanning strategies that included the potential sale of certain noncore operating assets to support the realization of our us federal deferred tax assets since current year losses are heavily weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the carryfoward period to realize the benefits of the strategies 

outlook for the company 

although we continue to be concerned about foreclosure activity and access to financing housing starts improved in 2011 to 607000 units we are cautiously optimistic about the economic trends in 2012 we believe the major restructuring activities in our installation and other services segment and in our north american cabinet operations have been completed 

  

we are focused on achieving our 2012 strategic initiatives which include leveraging our brands reducing our costs improving our installation and cabinet segments and strengthening our balance sheet we believe these initiatives coupled with the actions we have taken over the past several years should position us for improved results in 2012 even in a flat housing market and continue to believe that we will outperform as the housing market recovers 

we believe and are confident that the longterm fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets continue to be positive we believe that our strong financial position together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands including kraftmaid and merillat cabinets delta and hansgrohe faucets behr paint and milgard windows our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles will allow us to drive longterm growth and create value for our shareholders

changes in operating profit margins in the following business segment and geographic area results discussion exclude general corporate expense net charge for definedbenefit plan curtailment charge for litigation settlements accelerated stock compensation expense loss on corporate fixed assets net and impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2011 2010 and 2009 

business rationalizations and other initiatives 

over the past several years we have been focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions system implementations and other cost savings initiatives for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we incurred net pretax costs and charges related to these initiatives of 121 million 208 million and 94 million respectively 

during 2011 our north american cabinet business continued to incur costs and charges of 24 million related to the exit of its readytoassemble product line and 6 million related to the integration of its facilities our european manufacturer of ready to assemble cabinetry also incurred costs and charges of 9 million related to the closure of one manufacturing facility and the severance related to further headcount reductions our installation and other services segment incurred costs and charges of 4 million related to the closure of several locations and further headcount reductions our builders’ hardware business in the decorative architectural products segment incurred costs and charges of 9 million related to the exit of a product line our north american window manufacturer incurred costs and charges of 30 million related to the closure of several manufacturing facilities 

in 2010 we took several actions within the cabinets and related products segment to rationalize our north american manufacturers including closing plants exiting product lines and integrating our builder and retail cabinet groups we incurred costs and charges of 171 million in 2010 related to these actions 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we decided to dispose of several noncore businesses in the installation and other services segment these businesses were related to commercial drywall installation millwork and framing and have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods 

based on current plans we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate 20 million in 2012 we continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges 

cabinets and related products 

sales 

net sales of cabinets and related products decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower sales volumes of north american cabinets which reduced sales by approximately four percent compared to 2010 sales in this segment in 2011 were also negatively affected by the planned exit of north american readytoassemble and other noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines particle board and door product lines which reduced sales by approximately 11 percent compared to 2010 sales were also negatively affected by lower sales volume of international cabinets which reduced sales in this segment by approximately two percent compared to 2010 a weaker us dollar increased sales by one percent in 2011 compared to 2010 

net sales in this segment decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower sales volumes of north american cabinets which reduced sales by approximately six percent compared to 2009 sales in this segment in 2010 were also negatively affected by the planned exit of readytoassemble and other 

  

noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines particle board and door product lines which reduced sales by approximately four percent compared to 2009 sales were also negatively affected by lower sales volume of international cabinets which reduced sales in this segment by approximately three percent compared to 2009 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by one percent in 2010 compared to 2009 

net sales in this segment in 2009 were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume in the new home construction and retail markets as well as a less favorable product mix 

operating results 

operating margins in the cabinets and related products segment in 2011 were positively affected by lower business rationalization expenses and the benefits associated with such expenses including benefits related to the integration of the north american cabinet businesses such increases were partially offset by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs aggressive promotional activity and lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs 

operating margins in this segment in 2010 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs which reduced operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points operating profit margins in this segment in 2010 were also negatively affected by increased business rationalization expenses and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs such decreases more than offset the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

operating margins in this segment in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume in the new home construction and retail markets and the related underabsorption of fixed costs as well as a less favorable product mix which on a combined basis reduced operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points compared to 2008 in 2009 operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by increased plant closure and system implementation costs which were partially offset by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

plumbing products 

sales 

net sales of plumbing products increased in 2011 primarily due to increased selling prices which increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2010 sales were also positively affected by increased sales volume in north america and international which in aggregate increased sales by approximately three percent compared to 2010 a weaker us dollar increased sales by two percent in 2011 compared to 2010 

net sales in this segment increased in 2010 primarily due to a more favorable product mix to north american retailers and wholesalers which increased sales by approximately two percent compared to 2009 sales were also positively affected by increased selling prices which increased sales by approximately two percent compared to 2009 in local currencies sales of international operations increased sales in this segment by approximately three percent compared to 2009 such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume to north american retailers and wholesalers which reduced sales by one percent compared to 2009 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by one percent in 2010 compared to 2009 

net sales in this segment in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume to north american retailers and wholesalers reflecting the weakened global economy net sales in this segment in 2009 were also negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of international operations 

  

operating results 

operating margins in the plumbing products segment in 2011 were negatively affected by a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs a less favorable product mix and increased expenses related to growth initiatives which offset the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

operating margins in this segment in 2010 were positively affected by a more favorable product mix and the positive relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

operating margins in this segment in 2009 were positively affected by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as a more favorable product mix and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

installation and other services 

sales 

net sales in the installation and other services segment increased in 2011 primarily due to increased distribution sales increased selling prices and increased retrofit and commercial sales such increases were partially offset by lower sales volume of installed products related to a continued decline in the new home construction market the downward trend in the size and content of new houses in early 2011 and the increased multifamily construction we gained share in singlefamily construction 

net sales in this segment decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower sales volume related to reduced share in the new home construction market sales in this segment were also negatively affected by a downward trend in the size and content of new houses being constructed by our builder customers 

net sales in this segment in 2009 were negatively affected by significantly lower sales volume related to the decline in the new home construction market as well as lower selling prices

we continue to experience a prolonged and substantial downturn in the home improvement and new home construction markets as a result during 2010 we continued to focus on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions system implementations and other cost savings initiatives since 2006 across our businesses we have closed 23 manufacturing facilities also since 2006 we have closed approximately 100 locations formerly operated by our installation and other services segment in 2010 we began the combination of our north american retail and builder cabinet businesses to form masco cabinetry in 2010 we decided to discontinue the manufacture of readytoassemble and other noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines as they were not consistent with masco cabinetry’s strategy of growth through brand building and innovation in 2010 we also decided to close a cabinet manufacturing facility that had previously been idled 

 

we continue to focus on our cost structure and are driving process improvement through the implementation of the masco business system “mbs” the mbs is the integrated leadership practices processes tools and capabilities that enable the effective and consistent execution of our strategies and operating plans to maximize our full potential through the mbs we are advancing our strategy of growing organic sales based on a better understanding of our customer needs and investing in new product innovation we are also focusing on enhancing customer experience through improvements in product quality in 2010 we introduced several new products including the essence series tm wood and fiberglass window by milgard the red ® line of staple guns and nail tackers and the ace ® salt water sanitizing system we are also continuing to invest in several initiatives launched in 2009 including programs related to behr premium plus ultra ® interior paint the delta ® touch 2 o ® faucet retrofit home energy efficiency services and the sale of behr ® and kilz ® branded products to professional painters

cabinets and related products 

 

in north america we manufacture and sell economy stock and semicustom assembled cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points in europe we manufacture and sell assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment cabinetry these products are sold in the united states and in europe under a number of trademarks including kraftmaid ®  distinctions ®  tvilumscanbirk tm and woodgate ® primarily to dealers and home centers and under the merillat ®  moores tm and quality cabinets tm brands primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home improvement and new home construction markets cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major home improvement products a significant portion of our sales for the home improvement market is made through home center retailers we have also 

expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the manufacture and sale of countertops in north america 

 

over the past several years the new home construction market has declined over 70 percent since the peak this segment has been particularly affected by this downturn as well as builders producing smaller homes with smaller kitchens this segment has also been negatively affected by a downturn in the repair and remodel market particularly by consumers deferring expenditures for bigticket items 

 

in 2010 we began the combination of our builder cabinet group and retail cabinet group to form masco cabinetry we believe that the creation of masco cabinetry will help us establish an even stronger position to lead the cabinet category within the repair and remodel and new home construction markets masco cabinetry will offer a three brand portfolio of cabinets covering several price points addressing consumer preferences masco cabinetry will also focus on growing the countertop business 

 

over the past several years we have closed several manufacturing plants in this segment in 2010 we decided to discontinue the manufacture of readytoassemble and other noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines as they were not consistent with masco cabinetry’s strategy of growth through brand building and innovation this will result in the closure of two additional manufacturing facilities in the second quarter of 2011 in 2010 we also decided to close a manufacturing facility that had been previously idled 

 

we are currently focused on improving cabinet production efficiencies at lower volumes while maintaining our ability to respond effectively to increased demand when the home improvement and new home construction markets improve we expect that by the end of the second quarter of 2011 we will be able to manufacture common cabinetry at most of our plants that principally manufacture cabinets for the new home construction market in north america 

 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and europe is highly competitive with several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection our significant north american competitors include american woodmark corporation and fortune brands inc 

 

plumbing products 

 

our plumbing products segment sells a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or for us our plumbing products are sold in north america and europe under various brand names including delta ®  peerless ®  hansgrohe ®  axor ®  brizo ®  brasstech ®  bristan tm  ginger ®  newport brass ®  alsons ®  sirrus tm and plumb shop ®  our products include singlehandle and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers and valves which are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors who in turn sell our products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others 

 

we believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in the north american and european markets with american standard kohler moen and price pfister as major brand competitors we also have several european competitors primarily in germany including friedrich grohe we face significant competition from private label products including house brands sold by certain of our customers many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured in asia the businesses in our plumbing products segment source products from asia and manufacture products in the united states europe and asia 

 

other plumbing products manufactured and sold by us include products branded as aqua glass ®  mirolin ® and american shower  bath tm acrylic and gelcoat tub and shower systems bath and shower enclosure units shower trays and laundry tubs which are sold primarily to wholesale plumbing distributors and home center retailers for the north american home improvement and new home construction markets our spas are manufactured and sold under hot spring ®  caldera ® and other trademarks directly to independent dealers major competitors include kohler lasco maax and jacuzzi we sell

in addition to price we believe that competition in our plumbing products markets is based largely on brand reputation product quality product innovation and features and breadth of product offering 

 

a substantial portion of our plumbing products are made from brass the major components of which are copper and zinc we have encountered volatility in the price of brass we have implemented a hedging strategy to attempt to minimize the impact of commodity price volatility legislation enacted in california vermont and maryland mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in those states federal legislation mandating a national standard for lead content in plumbing products will become effective in january 2014 faucet and water supply valve manufacturers including our plumbing product companies will be required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets and certain of our plumbing products 

 

in 2008 our delta faucet business introduced faucets incorporating its touch 2 o technology and in the future delta faucet plans to expand the use of its capacitance sensing proximity tm technology in its product offerings also in 2008 our delta faucet business introduced a new water delivery system known as diamond tm seal technology diamond seal technology reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet simplifies installation and satisfies the legislation described above regulating the acceptable lead content in plumbing products delta faucet has continued to incorporate diamond seal technology into most of its faucets the success of diamond seal technology depends on many factors including the performance of the technology and the market’s acceptance of the technology as well as delta faucet’s ability to successfully integrate the technology into its most popular faucets 

 

installation and other services 

 

our installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home construction market and to a lesser extent the commercial construction and retrofit markets throughout the united states in order to respond to the significant decrease in demand in the new home construction industry over the past several years we have implemented various cost savings initiatives including the consolidation and closure of approximately 100 branch locations this rationalization has been accomplished while maintaining our strategic presence in most of the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas “msa” in the united states in addition we have deemphasized the installation of certain noninsulation building products that are not core to our service offering including windows and paint in addition to insulation we offer gutters afterpaint products framing components fireplaces garage doors and cabinets the installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately eight percent nine percent and eleven percent of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively installed building products are supplied primarily to custom and production homebuilders by our network of branches located across the united states distributed products include insulation insulation accessories gutters fireplaces and roofing distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers including lumber yards from distribution centers in various parts of the united states 

 

within this segment we have launched several new initiatives related to improved energy efficiency including energy audit and repair services and retrofit installation services delivered directly to homeowners as well as through retailers and dealer outlets 

 

in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of installation service we believe that we are the largest national provider of installed insulation in 

the new home construction industry in the united states our competitors include several regional contractors as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards we believe that our financial resources are substantial compared to regional and local contractors 

 

decorative architectural products 

 

we produce architectural coatings including paints primers specialty paint products stains and waterproofing products the products are sold in the united states canada china mexico and south america under the brand names behr ®  kilz ® and expressions ® to “doityourself” and professional customers through home centers paint stores and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 20 percent 20 percent and 15 percent of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic sherwinwilliams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality technology and product innovation customer service and brand reputation 

 

our behr products are sold through the home depot the segment’s and our largest customer the paint departments at the home depot stores include the behr color center and computer kiosk with the color smart by behr ® computerized colormatching system that enables consumers to select and coordinate their paintcolor selection in 2009 behr’s product offering was enhanced by the introduction of the behr premium plus ultra interior paint which is a highquality low volatile organic compound interior paint and primer in one the loss of this segment’s sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand and from production capacity limitations petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs eg for resins solvents and packaging as well as titanium dioxide which can adversely affect the segment’s results of operations 

 

our decorative architectural products segment also includes liberty ® branded cabinet door window and other hardware which is manufactured for us and sold to home centers other retailers original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets key competitors in north america include amerock top knobs direct import hickory hardware and stanley black  decker decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names franklin brass ® and decor bathware ® to distributors home centers and other retailers competitors include moen and gatco

 item 1a risk factors 

 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity levels both of which are experiencing a prolonged and substantial downturn 

 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodeling and new home construction activity levels principally in north america and europe the new home construction market which is cyclical in nature is experiencing a prolonged and substantial downturn marked by continued softness in the demand for new homes an oversupply of new and existing homes on the market and more stringent standards for homebuyers seeking financing the oversupply of existing homes held for sale is exacerbated by a growing number of home mortgage foreclosures as well as uncertainties in the home foreclosure process which are contributing to the downward pressure on home prices 

 

unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction this economic decline is also adversely affecting our home improvement businesses continued low levels of consumer confidence high levels of unemployment and the downward pressure on home prices have made consumers increasingly reluctant to make additional investments in existing homes such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects the increasing number of households with negative equity in their homes and more conservative lending practices including for home equity loans which are often used to finance repairs and remodeling are limiting the ability of consumers to finance home improvements 

 

although we believe that the longterm outlook for the home improvement and new home construction markets is favorable we cannot predict the type timing or strength of a recovery in our markets prolonged depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvements and new home construction will continue to adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position and may disproportionately affect certain of our business segments that are most heavily dependent on new home construction markets and large consumer investments in home remodeling projects 

 

a prolonged economic downturn may reduce our financial resources and flexibility 

 

our credit agreement contains various financial covenants we must comply with including covenants regarding debt to total capitalization at december 31 2010 we had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 113 million alternatively we could absorb a reduction in shareholders’ equity of 61 million and remain in compliance with this covenant 

 

we have recently amended our credit agreement to allow for the addback to shareholders’ equity of the impairment charges we took in 2010 for financial investments goodwill and other intangible assets and changes to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense aggregating 986 million after tax the amendment deemed to be effective and applicable as of december 31 2010 also allows us to addback if incurred up to 350 million in the aggregate of future noncash charges we currently have borrowing capacity approximating 1 billion available under the credit agreement see footnote k for a detailed discussion of the terms of our credit facility and the recent amendment 

 

the valuation of assets on our balance sheet particularly goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses a further decline in the expectation of our future performance or a further deterioration in expectations regarding the timing and the extent of the recovery of the new home construction market may cause us to recognize additional noncash pretax impairment charges which are not determinable at this time for certain longlived assets including goodwill this could result in additional impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets or other longlived assets and a further reduction in shareholders’ equity such charges and potential reduction in shareholders’ equity may limit our borrowing capacity under our credit agreement there can be no assurance that we would be able to further amend the credit agreement or to obtain alternative financing that any such financing would be on acceptable terms or that we would be permitted to do so under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 

the volatile and challenging economic conditions of the past two years have caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices 

 

the volatile and challenging economic environment of the past two years has caused shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and changes in the business models and strategies of our customers such shifts which may or may not be longterm have altered the type and prices of products demanded by the endconsumer and our customers over the past two years we have seen a downward trend in the size of the new homes being built resulting in smaller kitchens and baths in addition consumers have shown an increasing interest in lowercost products if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changing consumer preferences our relationships with our customers could be harmed the demand for our products could be reduced and our market share could be negatively affected 

 

our response to the prolonged downturn has been to continue our focus on implementation of cost savings initiatives which have been costly and may not be effective 

 

during the current downturn in the home improvement and new home construction markets we have focused on cost saving initiatives including rationalizing our businesses through business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions system implementations and other cost saving initiatives during 2010 and 2009 we incurred pretax costs and charges of 208 million and 94 million respectively related to these initiatives in the future we may incur costs and charges relating to additional cost savings initiatives 

 

we may not fully achieve the anticipated cost savings from these initiatives if we do not effectively balance our focus on cost savings with the need to maintain a strong sales presence for our brands we could lose market share if the eventual recovery of our markets is fastpaced and robust we may not be able to replace our reduced manufacturing and installation capacity in a timely fashion and our ability to respond to increased demand could be limited 

 

we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 

 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or exited the business larger customers can make significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services our costs of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business sales of our home improvement and building products to home centers are substantial in 2010 sales to our largest customer the home depot were 20 billion approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales lowe’s is our second largest customer in 2010 our sales to lowe’s were less than ten percent of our consolidated net sales although homebuilders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowe’s would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts between our existing distribution channels have and will continue to occur in addition we may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our larger customers in addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may affect our ability to offer products to other customers 

 

our principal markets are highly competitive 

 

the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive and in recent years competition has intensified significantly competition is further intensified during economic downturns home centers are increasing their purchases of products directly from lowcost overseas suppliers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise additionally home centers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly 

toward professional contractors and installers we believe that competition in our industries is based on price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features and innovation 

 

in addition to the challenges we have faced as a result of the economic downturn our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and product development and innovation 

 

the cost and availability of materials and the performance of our supply chain affect our operating results 

 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other materials that are major components of our products or services in addition we may incur substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices delays in adjusting or in our inability to adjust selling prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases further when commodity prices decline we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services changes in energy costs and certain commodities not only impact our production costs but also the cost to transport our products 

 

we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 

 

we rely heavily or in certain cases exclusively on outside suppliers for certain of our products or key components generally these products and components are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities however the loss of or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements may disrupt our business and could adversely impact our financial condition operating results and cash flows 

 

international political monetary economic and social developments affect our business 

 

over 20 percent of our sales are made outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally the euro and the british pound sterling increased international sales make up an important part of our future strategic plans in addition we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia our international business faces risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices also impact our international business our international operating results may be influenced when compared to our north american results in part due to relative economic conditions in the european markets and due to competitive pricing pressures on certain products the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 

we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 

 

we continue to reduce our investment in private equity funds since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation in addition we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 

 

claims and litigation could be costly 

 

we are from time to time involved in various claims litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us these matters may include contract disputes automobile liability and other personal injury claims warranty disputes environmental claims or proceedings other tort claims employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation including class actions 

 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend or manage also we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

 

we have also experienced class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability and wage and hour issues we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases due to their scope and complexity however these lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve and significant exposures have been alleged 

 

increasingly our homebuilder customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities caused by our negligence these claims often asserted several years after completion of construction can result in complex lawsuits or claims against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including us and may require us to incur defense and indemnity costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

 

although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter 

 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

see note s to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

 

government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 

 

we are subject to us and foreign government regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees and consumers climate disruption and environmental issues in addition to 

complying with current requirements and requirements that will become effective at a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future compliance with these regulations may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing such actions could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position 

 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented personnel 

 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel and as we consider entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with these markets we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries including large multinational firms and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipate” “intend” “plan” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “assume” “seek” “appear” “may” “should” “will” and similar references to future periods these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements we caution you against relying on any of these forwardlooking statements in addition to the various factors included in the “executive level overview” “critical accounting policies and estimates” and “outlook for the company” sections our future performance may be affected by our reliance on new home construction and home improvement levels our reliance on key customers the cost and availability of raw materials shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and our ability to achieve cost savings through the masco business system and other initiatives these and other factors are discussed in detail in item 1a “risk “factors” of this report any forwardlooking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date on which it was made factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of them we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

executive level overview 

 

we manufacture distribute and install home improvement and building products these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 

 

during 2010 we continued to experience further sales volume declines for our cabinets installation and other services and builders’ hardware products the sales volume decline for our installation and other services is primarily related to reduced revenue per job and the loss of market share in the new home construction market the sales volume decline for our cabinet products is related to lower repair and remodel activity and shifting consumer preference to lower price point products which has resulted in loss of market share related to cabinet repair and remodel activity with big box customers such sales volume declines were partially offset by a more favorable product mix of plumbing products and paints and stains net sales decreased three percent in 2010 from 2009 and operating profit as adjusted to exclude impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets general corporate expense net charge for definedbenefit plan curtailment charge for litigation settlements accelerated stock compensation expense and loss on corporate fixed assets net — see footnote o of the consolidated financial statements declined to 44 percent of sales in 2010 from 62 percent of sales in 2009 

 

factors that affect our results of operations include the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction principally in north america and europe the importance of our relationships with key customers including the home depot which represented approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2010 our ability to maintain our leadership positions in our us and global markets in the face of increasing competition and our ability to effectively manage our overall cost structure including the cost and availability of materials our international businesses face political monetary economic and other risks that vary from country to country as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates further we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk in addition litigation could be costly these and other factors are discussed in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” of this report 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments in addition we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults our bad debt expense was 19 million 34 million and 41 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

in north america we manufacture products principally windows doors and cabinets and provide installation of insulation and other products and services to homebuilders our bad debt expense related to homebuilders was 10 million 22 million and 28 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

  

we record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

 

  

on january 1 2008 we adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities this guidance defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” further it defines a fair value hierarchy as follows level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data and level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale securities and a number of private equity funds which aggregated 62 million and 106 million respectively at december 31 2010 we record investments in availableforsale securities at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax effect through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet we estimated the fair value of investments in availableforsale securities using primarily level 1 inputs 

 

in the past we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7 28 or 35 days at december 31 2010 our investment in auction rate securities was 22 million we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007 the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated on a recurring basis using a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately 1 million 

 

we carry our investments in private equity funds and other private investments at cost it is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private investments because there are no quoted market prices and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund these investments are evaluated on a nonrecurring basis for potential otherthantemporary impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment due to the significant unobservable inputs the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a level 3 input 

 

impairment indicators we consider include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates industry and sector performance current equity and credit market conditions and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund including industry and sector performance the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential otherthantemporary impairment include current economic conditions market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in residential and commercial construction biotechnology health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds’ investments operate 

 

at december 31 2010 we have investments in 17 venture capital funds with an aggregate carrying value of 22 million the venture capital funds invest in startup or smaller earlystage established businesses principally in the information technology biotechnology and health care sectors at december 31 2010 we also have investments in 26 buyout funds with an aggregate carrying value of 84 million the buyout funds invest in laterstage established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 

 

since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments the timing of distributions from the funds which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments as well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash can be difficult to predict as a result the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 

 

we record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary during 2010 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges of 34 million related to our investment in asahi tec 28 million three private equity funds 4 million and one private investment 2 million 

  

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by accounting guidance our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information including fiveyear forecasts are available 

 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 

 

in 2010 for our reporting units that primarily sell to the new home construction market including those in the installation and other services segment we utilized estimated housing starts from independent industry sources growing from current levels to 15 million units in 2015 terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical margins for those business units by 2015 terminal growth year we generally utilize our weighted average cost of capital discount rate of approximately eight percent to discount the estimated cash flows however in 2010 due to market conditions we increased the discount rate to a range of nine percent to eleven percent for most of our reporting units based upon a review of the current risks impacting our businesses 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 

 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

 

in 2010 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill aggregating 711 million 587 million after tax the pretax impairment charge relates to our north american installation business and reflects the weak level of new home construction activity in 2010 the historic low levels of new housing starts and the expectation that the recovery in the new home construction market will be modestly slower than previously anticipated we increased the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of our businesses in the new home construction industry due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and trajectory of the recovery in the new home construction market these changes resulted in our book value exceeding the estimated fair value of the business resulting in the impairment charge for goodwill 

 

a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2010 would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional business unit 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the nearand longterm in 2010 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets of 10 million 6 million after tax the pretax impairment charges recorded in 2010 were as follows plumbing products segment — 1 million and installation and other services segment — 9 million 

 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

 

  

our 2005 long term stock incentive plan the “2005 plan” provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms to employees and nonemployee directors at december 31 2010 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of longterm stock awards stock options phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 

 

  

we grant longterm stock awards to key employees and nonemployee directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market we measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date there was 127 million ten million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december 31 2010 which was included as a reduction of common stock and paidin capital effective january 1 2010 the vesting period for stock awards awarded after january 1 2010 is 5 years effective january 1 2006 we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards typically 5 to 10 years except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older which vest over five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 for stock awards granted prior to january 1 2006 we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards typically 5 to 10 years or for executive grantees that are or will become retirementeligible during the vesting period we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement pretax compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was 37 million for 2010 

 

  

we grant stock options to key employees the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date 

 

we measure compensation expense for stock options using a blackscholes option pricing model for stock options granted subsequent to january 1 2006 we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options typically five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 the expense for unvested stock options at january 1 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a blackscholes option pricing model for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the stock options typically five years pretax compensation expense for stock options was 22 million for 2010 

 

we estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2010 riskfree interest rate — 276 dividend yield — 217 volatility 

factor — 4603 and expected option life — 6 years for expense calculation purposes the weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares granted in 2010 was 530 per option share 

 

if we increased our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2010 would increase by 43 percent if we lowered our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2010 would decrease by 53 percent 

 

  

in march 2009 the board of directors approved freezing all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans the freeze was effective january 1 2010 as a result of this action the liabilities for these plans were remeasured and we recognized a curtailment charge of 8 million in the first quarter of 2009 in addition certain assumptions appropriate for ongoing plans eg turnover mortality and compensation increases were modified or eliminated for the remeasurement 

 

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2010 we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of 530 percent from 580 percent the discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the december 31 2010 towers watson rate link curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 230 percent to 555 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 500 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 725 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 359 million at december 31 2010 from 332 million at december 31 2009 primarily due to lower rates of return in the bond market in 2010 in accordance with accounting guidance the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2010 and 2009 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2010 had a net gain of approximately 12 percent compared to average gains of 13 percent for the corporate funds universe within the independent consultant cooperative 

 

our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 163 million at december 31 2010 compared with 152 million at december 31 2009 this unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 24 million in 2011 compared with 23 million in 2010 if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2011 pension expense would increase by 4 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 9 million in 2011 compared with 9 million in 2010 

 

we have several funding options and credits available and we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 30 million to 35 million in 2011 to our qualified definedbenefit plans 

  

the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability taxplanning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 

 

if based upon all available evidence both positive and negative it is more likely than not more than 50 percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable a company’s threeyear cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the company can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 371 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position these factors negatively impact our ability to utilize previously identified taxplanning strategies that included the potential sale of certain noncore operating assets to support the realization of our us federal deferred tax assets since current year losses are heavily weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the carryforward period to realize the benefit of the strategies 

 

recording the valuation allowance does not restrict our ability to utilize the future deductions and net operating losses associated with the deferred tax assets assuming taxable income is recognized in future periods 

 

a rebound in the us housing market from the current historic lows and retail sales of building products improving from their current levels should have a positive impact on our operating results in the us a return to sustained profitability in the us should result in objective positive evidence thereby warranting consideration of our previously identified taxplanning strategies and the potential reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance 

 

the 228 million of deferred tax assets at december 31 2010 for which there are no valuation allowance recorded is anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities at december 31 2010 

 

should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

 

the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 

 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for uncertain tax positions accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

  

certain of our products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions to the extent that we experience any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 

 

the majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and we record deductions at the time of sale 

 

we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments see note s to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings 

 

corporate development strategy 

 

our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units including consolidations and increasing synergies among our business units going forward we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development startup businesses related to home energy services and greenfield locations related to certain installation and other services businesses as part of our strategic planning we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

 

during 2010 we did not sell any business unit or acquire any business we accounted for the business units which were sold in 2009 and 2008 as discontinued operations see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information the results of all acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by a combination of our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 

 

maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies such strategies have resulted in cash of over 17 billion at december 31 2010 our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 72 percent and 58 percent at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

on june 21 2010 the company entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a bank group with an aggregate commitment of 125 billion with a maturity date of january 10 2014 our previous 5year revolving credit agreement dated as of november 5 2004 as amended was terminated at that time 

 

the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to the company and one of its foreign subsidiaries in us dollars european euros and certain other currencies borrowings under the revolver denominated in euros are limited to 500 million equivalent the company can also borrow swingline loans up to 150 million and obtain letters of credit of up to 250 million any outstanding letters of 

credit reduce the company’s borrowing capacity at december 31 2010 the company had 99 million of outstanding and unused letters of credit reducing the company’s borrowing capacity by such amount 

 

our revolving credit loans bear interest under the credit agreement at the company’s option at a a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i prime rate ii the federal funds effective rate plus 050 and iii libor plus 10 the “alternative base rate” plus an applicable margin based upon the thenapplicable corporate credit ratings of the company or b libor plus an applicable margin based upon the thenapplicable corporate credit ratings of the company the foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin based upon the thenapplicable corporate credit ratings of the company 

 

the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring the company to maintain a a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 65 percent and b a minimum interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than i 225 to 10 through the quarter ending on september 30 2011 and ii 250 to 10 thereafter the debt to total capitalization ratio allows the addback if incurred of up to the first 500 million of certain noncash charges including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges occurring from and after april 1 2010 that would negatively impact shareholders’ equity 

 

based on the limitations of the debt to total capitalization covenant before the amendment discussed below at december 31 2010 the company had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 113 million alternatively at december 31 2010 the company could absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately 61 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 

 

in order to borrow under the credit agreement there must not be any default in the company’s covenants in the credit agreement ie in addition to the two financial covenants principally limitations on subsidiary debt negative pledge restrictions legal compliance requirements and maintenance of properties and insurance and the company’s representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing ie principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change since december 31 2009 in each case no material erisa or environmental noncompliance and no material tax deficiency the company was in compliance with all covenants and no borrowings have been made at december 31 2010 

 

on february 11 2011 the company entered into an amendment deemed to be effective and applicable as of december 31 2010 of the credit agreement with its bank group the “amendment” the amendment provides for the addback to shareholders’ equity in the company’s maximum debt to capitalization covenant of i certain noncash charges including impairment charges for financial investments goodwill and other intangible assets and ii changes to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense each taken in 2010 which aggregate 986 million after tax the amendment also permits the company to addback if incurred up to 350 million in the aggregate of future noncash charges we currently have borrowing capacity approximating 1 billion available under the credit agreement 

 

we have no scheduled maturities until july 2012 when 791 million of 5875 fixed rate notes become due the holders of the company’s zero coupon convertible senior notes “notes” have the right to redeem the notes for cash on july 20 2011 for approximately 58 million the next cash redemption date is july 20 2016 

 

we had cash and cash investments of over 17 billion at december 31 2010 principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds principally as part of our tax planning strategies as any gains enhance the utilization of any 

current and future capital tax losses we determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid availableforsale and marketable securities to balance risk since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources we have and will continue to reduce our investments in longterm financial assets 

 

during 2010 we paid a quarterly dividend of 075 per common share 

 

our working capital ratio was 23 to 1 and 19 to 1 at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar we have also entered into commodity contracts related to copper and zinc 

 

cash flows 

 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 

 

 

 

our cash and cash investments increased 302 million to 1715 million at december 31 2010 from 1413 million at december 31 2009 

 

net cash provided by operations of 465 million consisted primarily of net loss adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 279 million a 721 million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets a 168 million net change in deferred taxes a 67 million charge for the impairment of longlived assets related to the closure of a cabinet facility a 34 million charge for the impairment of financial investments and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense amortization expense related to instore displays and interest expense on the zero coupon convertible senior notes as well as a net decrease in working capital of 49 million 

 

we continue to emphasize balance sheet management including working capital management and cash flow generation days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days at december 31 2010 compared with 48 days at december 31 2009 and days sales in inventories were 49 days at december 31 2010 and 

48 days at december 31 2009 accounts payable days were 51 days at december 31 2010 and 47 days at december 31 2009 working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable as a percent of sales was 134 percent at december 31 2010 and 147 percent at december 31 2009 such improvement was primarily due to improved accounts payable management 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 40 million and included 359 million for the retirement of notes retired 300 million of floating rate notes on march 12 2010 the scheduled maturity date and during the second quarter of 2010 we repurchased 59 million of 5875 notes due july 2012 in openmarket transactions partially offset by 494 million from the issuance of notes net of issuance costs financing activities also include cash outflows of 108 million for cash dividends paid 2 million for the net payment of debt and 45 million for the acquisition of our common stock to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2010 

 

at december 31 2010 we had remaining board of directors’ authorization to repurchase up to an additional 27 million shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities consistent with past practice we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2011 to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs 

 

net cash used for investing activities was 109 million and included 137 million for capital expenditures cash provided by investing activities included primarily 18 million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and 42 million from the net sale of financial investments 

 

we invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity improve customer service and support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2010 were 137 million compared with 125 million for 2009 and 200 million for 2008 for 2011 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2011 acquisitions are expected to be approximately 230 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2010 totaled 279 million compared with 254 million for 2009 and 238 million for 2008 for 2011 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2011 acquisitions is expected to be approximately 260 million amortization expense totaled 18 million 17 million and 17 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor do we expect them to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results 

 

  

net sales for 2010 were 76 billion representing a decrease of three percent from 2009 excluding results from acquisitions and the effect of currency translation net sales decreased two percent compared 

with 2009 the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 

 

 

 

net sales for 2010 were adversely affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services and cabinets which in aggregate reduced sales by approximately three percent compared to 2009 net sales for 2010 were also negatively affected by lower sales volume of builders’ hardware and north american plumbing products which reduced net sales by approximately one percent compared to 2009 such declines were partially offset by a more favorable product mix of plumbing products and paints and stains which increased sales by approximately one percent compared to 2009 net sales volume in 2010 of our international plumbing products and windows increased in local currencies and increased consolidated net sales by approximately one percent compared to 2009 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by one percent compared to 2009 

 

net sales for 2009 were adversely affected by declines in the new home construction market which reduced sales volume by approximately nine percent compared to 2008 net sales for 2009 were also negatively affected by declines in consumer spending for home improvement products which contributed to lower sales volume reducing net sales by approximately six percent compared to 2008 such declines were partially offset by net selling price increases for certain products which increased sales by approximately one percent compared to 2008 net sales volume in 2009 of our international products declined in local currencies and reduced consolidated net sales by approximately three percent compared to 2008 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by two percent compared to 2008 

 

our gross profit margins were 242 percent 259 percent and 249 percent in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in the 2010 gross profit margin reflects lower sales volume increased depreciation expense related to plant closures and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs such decreases were partially offset by the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 213 percent in 2010 compared with 218 percent in 2009 and 190 percent in 2008 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2010 and 2009 reflect lower sales volume increased advertising expenses related to new product introductions and increased system implementation costs 

 

operating loss profit in 2010 2009 and 2008 includes 208 million 94 million and 78 million net respectively of costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating loss profit in 2010 2009 and 2008 includes 721 million 262 million and 467 million respectively of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets operating loss profit in 2009 includes 7 million of charges for litigation settlements operating loss profit margins as reported were 66 percent 07 percent and 09 percent in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively operating profit margins excluding the items above were 57 percent 54 percent and 68 percent in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

operating margins in 2010 were positively affected by the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives which more than offset the negative effect of lower sales volume and the less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs 

operating profit margins in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs and lower selling prices related to the decline in the new home construction market in north america as well as lower sales volume of plumbing products in the north american and international home improvement markets such declines in 2009 were partially offset by increased sales of paints and stains the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs across our businesses and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit margins in 2008 were adversely affected by accelerating declines in new home construction and a continued decline in consumer spending in north american and international markets both of which negatively impacted the sales volume in each of our segments 

 

  

during 2010 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 34 million related to financial investments 28 million related to asahi tec preferred stock and 6 million related to private equity funds and other private investments 

 

other net for 2010 included 9 million of income from financial investments net other net for 2010 also included realized foreign currency losses of 2 million and other miscellaneous items 

 

during 2009 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 10 million for our investments in private equity funds 

 

other net for 2009 included 3 million of income from financial investments net other net for 2009 also included realized foreign currency gains of 17 million and other miscellaneous items 

 

during 2008 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 58 million primarily related to financial investments in trimas common stock 31 million asahi tec common stock 1 million private equity funds 23 million and other investments 3 million 

 

other net for 2008 included 3 million of realized losses net from the sale of marketable securities and 4 million of income from other investments net other net for 2008 also included realized foreign currency losses of 29 million and other miscellaneous items 

 

interest expense was 251 million 225 million and 228 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in interest expense in 2010 is primarily due to the issuance of 500 million of 7125 notes in march 

 

  

loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2010 were 1043 million and 300 per common share respectively loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2009 were 140 million and 41 per common share respectively loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2008 were 366 million and 106 per common share respectively loss from continuing operations for 2010 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 721 million 593 million or 170 per common share after tax loss from continuing operations for 2009 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 262 million 180 million or 51 per common share after tax loss from continuing operations for 2008 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 467 million 445 million or 126 per common share after tax 

 

our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations was a 29 percent tax expense a 33 percent tax benefit and a 69 percent tax expense in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations excluding the 371 million income tax expense related to a valuation allowance on our us federal deferred tax assets recorded in 2010 and impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles was a 32 percent tax benefit a 30 percent tax expense and a 57 percent tax expense in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively compared to our normalized effective tax rate of 36 percent the lower 

effective tax rate in 2009 is due primarily to the reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions related to a withholding tax issue from a formerly held european company due to a favorable court decision the higher effective tax rate in 2008 reflects the additional us tax on a repatriation of lowtaxed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to utilize a foreign tax credit carryforward combined with a decrease in 2008 pretax income 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a 371 million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a noncash charge to income tax expense in reaching this conclusion we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 causing us to be in a threeyear cumulative us loss position these factors negatively impact our ability to utilize previously identified taxplanning strategies that included the potential sale of certain noncore operating assets to support the realization of our us federal deferred tax assets since current year losses are heavily weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the carryfoward period to realize the benefits of the strategies 

 

outlook for the company 

 

although we continue to be concerned about foreclosure activity and access to financing housing starts did improve in 2010 to 588000 units the negative trends impacting our business in the second half of 2010 including depressed new home construction lower bigticket repair and remodel activity and commodity cost pressures have continued into 2011 we expect a challenging business environment particularly in the first half of 2011 we expect the second half of 2011 to be stronger 

 

in addition to strategic rationalization and the continued emphasis on cash generation we have identified directed and encouraged initiatives at our business units that we expect will position us to benefit from future opportunities as the recovery takes shape we have also led a focused effort to strengthen our brands and improve our ability to execute our business models the implementation of the masco business system mbs across our business units provides a more disciplined approach to managing our businesses and has enhanced our longrange planning process mbs emphasizes five core capabilities customer focus innovation lean quality and talent which we believe are fundamental to our longterm success mbs is already having a positive impact on our businesses as we enhance our understanding of customer and endconsumer needs improve product quality and incorporate sustainability into our operations and products as a result we believe we have a robust pipeline of innovative new products in addition we are also improving our operational performance by emphasizing process and productivity improvements simplifying organizational structure rationalizing supply chains and enhancing our talent management process 

 

we believe and are confident that the longterm fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets continue to be positive we believe that our strong financial position together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands including kraftmaid and merillat cabinets delta and hansgrohe faucets behr paint and milgard windows our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles will allow us to drive longterm growth and create value for our shareholders

business rationalizations and other initiatives 

 

over the past several years we have been focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions system implementations and other cost savings initiatives for the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred net costs and charges of 208 million pretax related to these initiatives for the year ended december 31 2009 we incurred net costs and charges of 94 million pretax related to these initiatives for the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred net costs and charges of 78 million pretax related to these initiatives 

 

as announced in february 2010 we have combined our builder cabinet group and retail cabinet group to form masco cabinetry in 2010 we incurred costs and charges related to the integration of 20 million in 2011 we expect to incur an additional 10 million of costs and charges related to the integration in april 2010 masco cabinetry decided to discontinue the manufacture of readytoassemble and other noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines as they are not consistent with masco cabinetry’s strategy of growth through brand building and innovation these product lines had aggregate annual sales of approximately 200 million in 2009 we plan to close two manufacturing facilities associated with these products in the first half of 2011 in 2010 we incurred costs and charges related to the exit of these product lines of 84 million including noncash charges of 69 million principally related to accelerated depreciation for property plant and equipment and 15 million of other cash charges in 2011 we expect to incur an additional 25 million of costs and charges related to the closure of the facilities associated with these product lines in 2010 we also decided to close a cabinet manufacturing facility that had been previously idled we incurred costs and charges related to the closure of 67 million as a result of these actions within the cabinets and related products segment in 2010 we incurred pretax 171 million of total costs and charges related to masco cabinetry integration product line exit and facility closure in total as described above we expect to incur an additional 35 million of costs and charges related to these actions in 2011 

 

based on current plans we anticipate costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other initiatives to approximate 65 million in 2011 we continue to evaluate our businesses and may implement additional rationalization programs based on changes in our markets which could result in further costs and charges 

 

  

sales 

 

net sales of cabinets and related products decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower sales volumes of north american cabinets which reduced sales by approximately six percent compared to 2009 sales in this segment in 2010 were also negatively affected by the planned exit of readytoassemble and other noncore instock assembled cabinet product lines particle board and door product lines which reduced sales by approximately four percent compared to 2009 sales were also negatively affected by lower sales volume of international cabinets which reduced sales in this segment by approximately three percent compared to 2009 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by one percent in 2010 compared to 2009 

 

net sales in this segment decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decline in sales volume in the new home construction and retail markets as well as a less favorable product mix which combined to reduce sales by approximately 24 percent compared to 2008 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by two percent in 2009 compared to 2008 

net sales in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume in the new home construction and retail markets as well as a less favorable product mix and lower local currency sales of international operations 

 

operating results 

 

operating margins in the cabinets and related products segment in 2010 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs which reduced operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points operating profit margins in this segment in 2010 were also negatively affected by increased business rationalization expenses and a less favorable relationship between selling prices and commodity costs such decreases more than offset the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

 

operating margins in this segment in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume in the new home construction and retail markets and the related underabsorption of fixed costs as well as a less favorable product mix which on a combined basis reduced operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points compared to 2008 in 2009 operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by increased plant closure and system implementation costs which were partially offset by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

 

operating margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs and a less favorable product mix as well as lower results of international operations included in this segment

over the past three years we have experienced a significant downturn in the home improvement and new home construction markets as a result we have been focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses including business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions system implementations and other cost savings initiatives throughout our businesses we have closed several plants and since 2006 we have closed over 90 locations formerly operated by our installation and other services segment

cabinets and related products 

 

in north america we manufacture and sell economy stock semicustom assembled and readytoassemble cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points in europe we manufacture and sell assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment cabinetry these products are primarily sold in the united states and in europe under a number of trademarks including kraftmaid ®  distinctions ®  tvilumscanbirk tm and woodgate ® primarily to dealers and home centers and under the brands merillat ®  moores tm and quality cabinets ® primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home improvement and new home construction markets cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major home 

improvement products a significant portion of our sales for the home improvement market is made through home center retailers 

 

over the past several years this segment of our business has been particularly affected by the downturn in the home improvement and new home construction markets due to new homebuilders producing smaller homes with smaller kitchens and endconsumers shifting to lower price point products in 2009 we closed several manufacturing plants in this segment we are currently focused on improving cabinet production efficiencies at lower volumes while maintaining our ability to respond effectively to increased demand when the home improvement and new home construction markets improve by the end of 2010 we expect that we will be able to manufacture a common base cabinet at all of our plants that principally manufacture cabinets for the new home construction market in north america we have also expanded our product offerings in this segment to include the manufacture and sale of countertops in north america 

 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and europe is highly competitive with several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection significant north american competitors include american woodmark corporation and fortune brands inc 

 

in february 2010 we announced the combination of our builder cabinet group and retail cabinet group to form masco cabinetry we believe that the creation of masco cabinetry will help us establish an even stronger position to lead the cabinet category within the repair and remodel and new home construction markets masco cabinetry will focus on all channels of distribution by offering a broad portfolio of cabinets and countertops at a wide range of price points and in a variety of styles 

 

plumbing products 

 

our plumbing products segment sells a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or for us our plumbing products are sold in north america and europe under various brand names including delta ®  peerless ®  hansgrohe ®  axor ®  brizo ®  brasstech ®  bristan tm  newport brass ®  alsons ®  sirrus tm and plumb shop ®  products include singlehandle and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers and valves which are sold to major retail accounts and to wholesalers and distributors who sell these products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others 

 

we believe that our products in this segment are among the leaders in sales in the north american and european markets with american standard kohler moen and price pfister as major brand competitors we also have several european competitors primarily in germany including friedrich grohe we face significant competition from private label products including house brands sold by certain of our customers many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured in asia the businesses in our plumbing products segment source products from asia and manufacture products in the united states europe and asia

marketed in north america for the wholesale trade under the brasscraft ® and brasstech trademarks and for the “doityourself” market under the master plumber ® and plumb shop trademarks and are also sold under private label 

 

in addition to price we believe that competition in our plumbing products markets is based largely on brand reputation product quality product innovation and features and breadth of product offering 

 

a substantial portion of our plumbing products are made from brass the major components of which are copper and zinc from time to time we have encountered volatility in the price of brass in the past we have implemented a hedging strategy to attempt to minimize the impact of commodity price volatility a hedging strategy may be implemented in the future legislation enacted in california and vermont which became effective in january 2010 mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in those states similar legislation may be considered by other states faucet and water supply valve manufacturers including our plumbing product companies will be required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets 

 

in 2008 our delta faucet business introduced a new water delivery system known as diamond seal technology diamond seal technology reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet simplifies installation and satisfies the legislation enacted in california and vermont regulating the acceptable lead content in plumbing products delta faucet in the nearterm plans to incorporate diamond seal technology into its domestically manufactured singlehandle faucets and in the future plans to expand the application of the technology to most other delta faucets the success of diamond seal technology depends on many factors including the performance of the technology and the market’s acceptance of the technology as well as delta’s ability to integrate successfully the technology into its most popular faucets 

 

installation and other services 

 

our installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home construction market and to a lesser extent the commercial construction market throughout the united states in order to respond to the significant decrease in demand in the new home construction industry over the past three years we have implemented several cost savings initiatives involving the consolidation and closure of over 90 branch locations this rationalization has been accomplished while maintaining our strategic presence in most of the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas “msa” in the united states in addition over the past two years in this segment we have deemphasized the installation of certain noninsulation building products that are not core to our service offering including windows and paint in addition to insulation our current offering of installed building products primarily consists of gutters afterpaint products framing components fireplaces garage doors and cabinets the installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately nine percent 11 percent and 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively installed building products are supplied primarily to custom and production homebuilders by our network of branches located in most msa’s throughout the united states distributed products include insulation insulation accessories gutters roofing and fireplaces distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers from distribution centers in various parts of the united states 

 

within this segment we have also begun several new initiatives related to improved energy efficiency including energy audit services and related home improvements targeted at the retrofit and remodeling markets 

 

in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of installation service we believe that we are the largest national provider of installed insulation in the new home construction industry in the united states our competitors include several regional contractors as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards we believe that our financial resources are substantial compared to regional and local contractors 

decorative architectural products 

 

we produce architectural coatings including paints primers specialty paint products stains varnishes and waterproofing products the products are sold in the united states canada china mexico and south america under the brand names behr ®  kilz ®  casual colors ® and expressions ® to the “doityourself” and professional markets through home centers paint stores and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 20 percent 15 percent and 13 percent of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic sherwinwilliams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price we believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality technology and product innovation customer service and brand reputation 

 

our behr brand is sold through the home depot the segment’s and our largest customer the paint departments at the home depot stores include the behr color center and computer kiosk with the color smart by behr ® computerized colormatching system that enables consumers to select and coordinate their paintcolor selection in 2009 behr’s product offering was enhanced by the introduction of the behr premium plus ultra interior paint which is a highquality low volatile organic compound interior paint and primer in one the loss of this segment’s sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole 

 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand and from production capacity limitations petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs eg for resins solvents and packaging as well as titanium dioxide which can adversely affect the segment’s results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that have affected and may continue to affect our business these risks and uncertainties have negatively impacted our current results and could cause our future results to differ from past performance or expected results including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the effect on us of certain of these risk factors is discussed below under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity levels both of which have experienced a significant downturn 

 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodeling and new home construction activity levels principally in north america and europe the new home construction market which is cyclical in nature has undergone a significant downturn marked by declines in the demand for new homes an oversupply of new and existing homes on the market and a reduction in the availability of financing for homebuyers the oversupply of existing homes held for sale has been exacerbated by a growing number of home mortgage foreclosures which has contributed to the downward pressure on home prices 

 

unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction this economic decline has also adversely affected our home improvement businesses low levels of consumer confidence and the downward pressure on home prices have made it much more difficult for homeowners to make additional investments in their homes such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects further disruptions in the credit markets have limited the ability of consumers to finance home improvements 

 

we believe that during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 there have been some signs of stabilization in our markets and we continue to believe that the longterm outlook for the home improvement and new home construction markets is favorable however we cannot predict the type timing or strength of a recovery in our markets depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvements and new home construction have adversely affected our results of operations and our financial position 

 

furthermore the economic turmoil has caused certain shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and has resulted in changes in the business models and strategies of our customers such shifts which may or may not be longterm have altered the nature and prices of products demanded by the endconsumer and our customers if we do not timely and effectively respond to these changing consumer preferences our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected the demand for our products could be reduced and our market share could be negatively affected 

 

a prolonged economic downturn could reduce our financial resources and flexibility 

 

the valuation of assets on our balance sheet particularly goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses a further decline in the expectation of our future performance or a continuation of the adverse conditions in the new home construction markets may cause us to recognize noncash impairment charges which are not determinable at this time for certain longlived assets including goodwill and could result in a reduction in our shareholders’ equity in the future such a reduction in our shareholders’ equity may limit our borrowing capacity under our existing fiveyear revolving credit agreement 

 

we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 

 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or exited the business larger customers can make significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services our costs of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial in 2009 sales to our largest customer the home depot were 21 billion approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales lowe’s is our second largest customer in 2009 our sales to lowe’s were less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales although homebuilders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowe’s would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts between our existing distribution channels have occurred and will continue to occur in addition we may undermine the 

business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our larger customers in addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may affect the products we can offer to other customers 

 

our principal markets are highly competitive 

 

the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive and in recent years competition has intensified significantly competition is further intensified during economic downturns home center retailers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers particularly lowcost suppliers in asia for sale as private label and house brand merchandise also home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and installers we believe that competition in our industries is based largely on price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features and innovation although the relative importance of such factors varies among customers and product categories price is often a primary factor 

 

in addition to the challenges we have faced as a result of the economic downturn in our markets our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and product development and innovation 

 

the cost and availability of materials and the performance of our supply chain affect our operating results 

 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other materials that are major components of our products or services in addition we may incur substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices delays in adjusting or in our inability to adjust selling prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases further when commodity prices decline we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services changes in energy costs and certain commodities not only impact our production costs but also the cost to transport our products 

 

we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 

 

we rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain of our products or key components if there is an interruption in these sources of supply we may experience difficulty or delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be disrupted 

 

international political monetary economic and social developments affect our business 

 

over 21 percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds in addition we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia our international business faces risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws and laws regulating various 

business practices also impact our international business our international operating results may be influenced when compared to our north american results in part due to relative economic conditions in the european markets and due to competitive pricing pressures on certain products the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 

 

we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 

 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale securities including marketable and auction rate securities and a number of private equity funds although we are reducing such investments since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation in addition we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund the decline in economic conditions in 2008 resulted in the decline in the value of our investments in debt and equity securities including assets held in our pension plans at december 31 2009 the fair value of such investments and assets remains at reduced levels 

 

claims and litigation could be costly 

 

we are from time to time involved in various claims litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us these matters may include contract disputes personal injury claims warranty disputes environmental claims or proceedings other tort claims employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation including class actions 

 

in recent years we have experienced class action lawsuits predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability and wage and hour issues we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases due to their scope and complexity however such lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve and significant exposures have been alleged 

 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend also we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell as a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

 

increasingly homebuilders including our customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install these claims often asserted several years after completion of construction frequently result in lawsuits against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including us and require us to incur defense costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

 

although we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 

 

we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the 

risks presented the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities if any significant accident judgment claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

see note s to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

 

government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 

 

government regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees as well as consumers and environmental concerns continue to emerge domestically as well as internationally in addition to having to comply with current requirements including requirements that do not become effective until a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future compliance with these regulations such as the restrictions on lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our businesses may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing such actions could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position 

 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing and product design and innovation and as we consider entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with these markets we compete with multinational firms for these employees and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 

 

the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and accordingly our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements readers should consider that various factors including those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” of this report the “executive level overview” “critical accounting policies and estimates” and “outlook for the company” sections may affect our performance we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

executive level overview 

 

we manufacture distribute and install home improvement and building products these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers homebuilders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 

 

during 2009 we experienced a decline in our markets including a decline in new home construction of over 38 percent from 2008 as well as a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products net sales decreased 18 percent in 2009 from 2008 and operating profit as adjusted to exclude impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets general corporate expense net charge for definedbenefit plan curtailment charge for litigation settlements accelerated stock compensation expense and loss gain on corporate fixed assets net — see footnote o of the consolidated financial statements declined to 62 percent of sales in 2009 from 75 percent of sales in 2008 

 

factors that affect our results of operations include the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction principally in north america and europe the importance of our relationships with key customers including the home depot which represented approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2009 our ability to maintain our leadership positions in our us and global markets in the face of increasing competition and our ability to effectively manage our overall cost structure including the cost and availability of materials our international businesses face political monetary economic and other risks that vary from country to country as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates further we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk in addition litigation could be costly these and other factors are discussed in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” of this report 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we regularly review our estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

 

  

we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments in addition we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults our bad debt expense was 34 million 41 million and 29 million for the year ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

in north america we manufacture products principally windows doors and cabinets and provide installation of insulation and other products and services to homebuilders our bad debt expense related to homebuilders was 22 million 28 million and 23 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

  

we record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

 

  

on january 1 2008 we adopted accounting guidance that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities this guidance defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” further it defines a fair value hierarchy for measurement and disclosure of the fair value for financial instruments as follows level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data and level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 

 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale securities and a number of private equity funds which aggregated 110 million and 123 million respectively at december 31 2009 we record investments in availableforsale securities at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax effect through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet we estimated the fair value of investments in availableforsale securities using primarily level 1 inputs we estimated the fair value of our investment in asahi tec preferred stock using a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 100 basis points the value of the asahi tec preferred stock would change by approximately three percent 

in the past we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7 28 or 35 days at december 31 2009 our investment in auction rate securities was 22 million we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since 2007 the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately 1 million 

 

we carry our investments in private equity funds at cost it is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds because there are no quoted market prices and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund these investments are evaluated on a nonrecurring basis for potential otherthantemporary impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment due to the significant unobservable inputs the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a level 3 input 

 

impairment indicators we consider include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates industry and sector performance current equity and credit market conditions and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund including industry and sector performance the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential otherthantemporary impairment include current economic conditions market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive and transportation residential and commercial construction biotechnology health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds’ investments operate 

 

at december 31 2009 we have investments in 17 venture capital funds with an aggregate carrying value of 28 million the venture capital funds invest in startup or smaller earlystage established businesses principally in the information technology biotechnology and health care sectors at december 31 2009 we also have investments in 28 buyout funds with an aggregate carrying value of 95 million the buyout funds invest in laterstage established businesses and other than the heartland industrial partners fund which is primarily in the automotive and transportation sector no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 

 

since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments the timing of distributions from the funds which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments as well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash can be difficult to predict as a result the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 

 

we record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary during 2009 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges of 10 million related to our investment in five private equity funds 

 

  

we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method we selected the discounted cash flow methodology as we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of 

goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by accounting guidance our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information including fiveyear forecasts are available 

 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates our judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows we rely on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast we generally develop these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 

 

in 2009 for our reporting units that primarily sell to the new home construction market including those in the installation and other services segment we utilized estimated housing starts from independent industry sources growing from current levels to 16 million units in 2014 terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical margins for those business units by 2014 terminal growth year we generally utilize our weighted average cost of capital discount rate of approximately nine percent to discount the estimated cash flows however in 2009 and 2008 due to market conditions we increased the discount rate for most of our reporting units based upon a review of the current risks impacting our businesses 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 

 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

 

in 2009 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill aggregating 262 million 180 million after tax the pretax impairment charge of 39 million relates to our european shower enclosure manufacturer and reflects a decline in the reporting unit’s anticipated longterm outlook the pretax impairment charge of 223 million relates to our manufacturer of staple gun tackers and other fastening tools and reflects a decline in the reporting unit’s anticipated longterm outlook 

 

a five percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2009 would have resulted in a step two analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the installation and other services segment a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december 31 2009 would have resulted in a step two analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the cabinets and related products segment one reporting unit in the installation and other services segment and one reporting unit in the other specialty products segment 

 

we review our other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit we consider the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the nearand longterm 

 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each 

reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

 

  

our 2005 long term stock incentive plan the “2005 plan” provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms to employees and nonemployee directors at december 31 2009 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of longterm stock awards stock options phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 

 

  

we grant longterm stock awards to key employees and nonemployee directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market we measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date there was 126 million nine million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december 31 2009 which was included as a reduction of common stock and paidin capital effective january 1 2006 we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards typically 5 to 10 years except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older which vest over five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 for stock awards granted prior to january 1 2006 we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards typically 10 years or for executive grantees that are or will become retirementeligible during the vesting period we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement pretax compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was 37 million for 2009 

 

  

we grant stock options to key employees and nonemployee directors the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date 

 

we measure compensation expense for stock options using a blackscholes option pricing model for stock options granted subsequent to january 1 2006 we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options typically five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 the expense for unvested stock options at january 1 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a blackscholes option pricing model for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the stock options typically five years pretax compensation expense for stock options was 25 million for 2009 

 

we estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2009 riskfree interest rate — 260 dividend yield — 370 volatility factor — 3918 and expected option life — 6 years for expense calculation purposes the weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares granted in 2009 was 228 per option share 

 

if we increased our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2009 would increase by 53 percent if we decreased our assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2009 would decrease by 61 percent 

 

  

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each 

employee works we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses we consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 

 

in march 2009 based on management’s recommendation the board of directors approved a plan to freeze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans the freeze was effective january 1 2010 as a result of this action the liabilities for the plans impacted by the freeze were remeasured and we recognized a curtailment charge of 8 million in the first quarter of 2009 

 

in december 2009 we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of 580 percent from 610 percent the discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the december 31 2009 citigroup pension discount curve the discount rates we use for our definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 260 percent to 625 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 560 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 800 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

 

our net underfunded amount for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 332 million at december 31 2009 from 344 million at december 31 2008 primarily due to the decision to freeze all future benefit accruals in accordance with accounting guidance the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 and 2008 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2009 had a net gain of approximately 22 percent compared to average gains of 21 percent for the corporate funds universe within the independent consultant cooperative 

 

our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 152 million at december 31 2009 compared with 147 million at december 31 2008 such unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

we expect pension expense for our qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 33 million in 2010 compared with 40 million in 2009 if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2010 pension expense would increase by 4 million we expect pension expense for our nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 8 million in 2010 compared with 15 million in 2009 

 

we have several funding options and credits available and we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately 20 million to 25 million in 2010 to our qualified definedbenefit plans 

 

  

we have considered potential sources of future taxable income in determining the amount of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of the 582 million of deferred tax assets recorded at december 31 2009 net of the valuation allowance 432 million is anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability and 150 million is anticipated to be realized through future gains from investments and other identified taxplanning strategies including the potential sale of certain operating assets and through capital gains in the carryback period 

 

the continued utilization of our taxplanning strategies is largely dependent upon the future performance of certain businesses a significant decline in the expectation of future performance may impact our valuation allowance assessment 

 

should we determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need 

to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 

 

effective january 1 2007 the fasb issued new guidance which allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities this new guidance establishes a lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions referred to as “unrecognized tax benefits” therefore we believe that there is a greater potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with prior guidance 

 

while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

 

  

certain of our products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the time of sale we accrue a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions to the extent that we experience any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 

 

the majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and we record deductions at the time of sale 

 

we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments see note s to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings 

 

corporate development strategy 

 

our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units including consolidations and increasing synergies among our business units going forward we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development startup businesses related to home energy services and greenfield locations related to certain installation and other services businesses as part of our strategic planning we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our longterm growth strategy 

 

during 2009 we sold two european business units in the plumbing products segment that were not core to our longterm growth strategy we recognized a net pretax loss of 43 million in 2009 related to these transactions 

 

we accounted for the business units which were sold in 2009 2008 and 2007 as discontinued operations see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

during 2009 we acquired a small business in the plumbing products segment this business allows us to expand into a developing market and had annual sales of 11 million for a net purchase price of 6 million in cash during 2008 we acquired a relatively small countertop business cabinet and related products segment this business which allows us to expand products and services we offer to our customers had annual sales of over 40 million during 2007 we acquired several relatively small installation service businesses installation and other services segment as well as erickson construction company and guy evans inc installation and other services segment 

 

the results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

historically we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by a combination of our operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of our common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 

 

maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies such strategies have led to cash of over 14 billion at december 31 2009 our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 58 percent and 57 percent at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

at our request in late april 2009 our bank group modified the terms of our fiveyear revolving credit agreement which expires in february 2011 after reviewing our anticipated liquidity position we requested that the maximum amount we could borrow under this facility be reduced to 125 billion from 20 billion in addition the debt to total capitalization ratio requirement has been increased from 60 percent to 65 percent the debt to total capitalization ratio and the minimum net worth covenants have also been amended to allow the addback if incurred of up to the first 500 million of certain noncash charges including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges that would negatively impact shareholders’ equity we incurred approximately 2 million of fees and expenses associated with the amendment if the facility is utilized we will incur higher borrowing costs as a result of the amendment 

 

the amended fiveyear revolving credit agreement contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth at december 31 2009 our net worth exceeded such requirement by 10 billion under the terms of the amended fiveyear revolving credit agreement any outstanding letters of credit reduce our borrowing capacity at december 31 2009 we had 83 million of unused letters of credit the amended fiveyear revolving credit agreement also contains limitations on additional borrowings related to the debt to total capitalization requirements at december 31 2009 we had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 12 billion in addition at december 31 2009 we could absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately 867 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 

 

in order to borrow under the amended fiveyear revolving credit agreement there must not be any defaults in our covenants in the credit agreement ie in addition to the two financial covenants principally limitations on subsidiary debt negative pledge restrictions legal compliance requirements and maintenance of insurance and our representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing ie principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change in each case since december 31 2008 no material erisa or environmental noncompliance and no material tax deficiency we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

we had cash and cash investments of over 14 billion at december 31 2009 principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations 

 

our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds principally as part of our tax planning strategies as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses we determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid availableforsale and marketable securities to balance risk since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources we have and will continue to reduce our investments in longterm financial assets 

 

during 2009 we announced the reduction of our quarterly dividend to 075 per common share from 235 per common share 

 

we have a scheduled maturity of our longterm indebtedness in march 2010 when 300 million of our floating rate notes become due subsequent to this maturity we have no scheduled maturities until july 2012 when our 850 million of 5875 fixed rate notes become due 

 

our working capital ratio was 19 to 1 and 21 to 1 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar 

 

cash flows 

 

significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows in millions 

 

 

 

our cash and cash investments increased 385 million to 1413 million at december 31 2009 from 1028 million at december 31 2008 

 

net cash provided by operations of 705 million consisted primarily of net loss adjusted for noncash and certain other items including depreciation and amortization expense of 254 million net loss on disposition of businesses of 40 million a 262 million charge for the impairment of goodwill a 10 million charge for the impairment of financial investments and other noncash items including stockbased compensation expense amortization expense related to instore displays and interest expense on the zero coupon convertible senior notes as well as a net decrease in working capital of 235 million 

we continue to emphasize balance sheet management including working capital management and cash flow generation days sales in accounts receivable were 48 days at december 31 2009 compared with 50 days at december 31 2008 and days sales in inventories were 48 days at both december 31 2009 and 2008 accounts payable days were 47 days at december 31 2009 and 43 days at december 31 2008 working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable as a percent of sales was 147 percent at both december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 197 million and included cash outflows of 166 million for cash dividends paid 11 million for the net payment of debt and 11 million for the acquisition of our common stock to offset the dilutive impact of longterm stock awards granted in 2009 

 

at december 31 2009 we had remaining board of directors’ authorization to repurchase up to an additional 30 million shares of our common stock in openmarket transactions or otherwise we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our nearterm working capital and other investment needs we believe that our longerterm working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary from bank borrowings and future financial market activities consistent with past practice we anticipate repurchasing shares in 2010 to offset any dilution from longterm stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs 

 

net cash used for investing activities was 118 million and included 125 million for capital expenditures and 8 million for acquisitions cash provided by investing activities included primarily 31 million of net proceeds from the disposition of businesses and property and equipment and 11 million from the net sale of financial investments 

 

we invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity to improve customer service and to support new product innovation capital expenditures for 2009 were 125 million compared with 200 million for 2008 and 248 million for 2007 for 2010 capital expenditures excluding any potential 2010 acquisitions are expected to approximate 190 million depreciation and amortization expense for 2009 totaled 254 million compared with 238 million for 2008 and 248 million for 2007 for 2010 depreciation and amortization expense excluding any potential 2010 acquisitions is expected to approximate 240 million amortization expense totaled 17 million 17 million and 20 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

costs of environmental responsibilities and compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had nor in our opinion are they expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures financial position or results of operations 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states however we believe that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results 

  

net sales for 2009 were 78 billion representing a decrease of 18 percent from 2008 excluding results from acquisitions and the effect of currency translation net sales decreased 16 percent compared with 2008 the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 

 

 

 

net sales for 2009 were adversely affected by declines in the new home construction market which reduced sales volume by approximately nine percent compared to 2008 economic conditions remain difficult in the new home construction market as fullyear 2009 housing starts have declined over 38 percent to 554000 from 2008 net sales for 2009 were also negatively affected by declines in consumer spending for home improvement products which contributed to lower sales volume reducing net sales by approximately six percent compared to 2008 such declines were partially offset by net selling price increases for certain products which increased sales by approximately one percent compared to 2008 

 

net sales volume of our international products declined in local currencies and reduced consolidated net sales by approximately three percent compared to 2008 a stronger us dollar decreased sales by two percent compared to 2008 

 

our gross profit margins were 259 percent 249 percent and 275 percent in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in the 2009 gross profit margin reflects the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs and the benefits associated with our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 218 percent in 2009 compared with 190 percent in 2008 and 171 percent in 2007 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 and 2008 reflect lower sales volume increased advertising expenses related to new product introductions and increased system implementation costs 

 

operating profit in 2009 2008 and 2007 includes 94 million 78 million and 78 million net respectively of costs and charges related to our business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit in 2009 2008 and 2007 includes 262 million 467 million and 119 million respectively of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets operating profit in 2009 and 2008 includes 7 million and 9 million respectively of charges for litigation settlements operating profit margins as reported were 07 percent 09 percent and 93 percent in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively operating profit margins excluding the items above were 54 percent 68 percent and 110 percent in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

operating profit margins in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs and lower selling prices related to the decline in the new home construction market in north america as well as lower sales volume of plumbing products in the north american and international home improvement markets such declines were partially offset by increased sales of paints and stains the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs across our businesses and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit margins in 2008 were adversely affected by accelerating declines in new home construction and a continued decline in consumer spending in north american and international markets both of which negatively impacted the 

sales volume in each of our segments and negatively impacted operating profit margins by approximately two percentage points compared to 2007 operating profit margins in 2007 were adversely affected by a decline in new home construction and a moderation in consumer spending in north america both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of installation and other services cabinets and windows and doors 

 

  

during 2009 we recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 10 million for our investments in private equity funds 

 

other net for 2009 included 3 million of income from financial investments net other net for 2009 also included realized foreign currency gains of 17 million and other miscellaneous items

other net for 2007 included 5 million of realized gains net from the sale of marketable securities 6 million of dividend income and 38 million of income from other investments net other net for 2007 also included 9 million of realized foreign currency gains and other miscellaneous items 

 

interest expense was 225 million 228 million and 258 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in interest expense in 2008 is primarily due to lower interest rates and the retirement of higher fixedrate debt in 2007 and 2008 

 

  

loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2009 were 140 million and 41 per common share respectively loss and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations for 2008 were 366 million and 106 per common share respectively income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2007 were 502 million and 132 per common share respectively loss from continuing operations for 2009 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 262 million 180 million or 51 per common share after tax loss from continuing operations for 2008 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 467 million 445 million or 126 per common share after tax income from continuing operations for 2007 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 119 million 100 million or 27 per common share after tax 

 

our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations was a 33 percent tax benefit in 2009 and a 69 percent tax expense in 2008 and for income from continuing operations was a 39 percent tax expense in 2007 our effective tax rate for income from continuing operations excluding the impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets was 30 percent 57 percent and 36 percent in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively compared to our normalized effective tax rate of 36 percent the lower effective tax rate in 2009 is due primarily to the reversal of an accrual for unrecognized tax benefits related to a withholding tax issue from a formerly held european company due to a recent favorable court decision the higher effective tax rate in 2008 reflects the additional us tax on a repatriation of lowtaxed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries in order to utilize a foreign tax credit carryforward combined with a decrease in our 2008 pretax income we expect our tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 37 percent 

outlook for the company 

 

we expect that business conditions in 2010 will improve compared to 2009 while we are concerned about the impact of current unemployment levels foreclosure activity and access to financing we believe that housing starts will improve in 2010 and will increase to a range of 600000 to 700000 units from 554000 units in 2009 

 

while we anticipate that expenditures on repair and remodel activity will improve modestly in 2010 from 2009 levels we believe that bigticket items will continue to be deferred until general economic conditions credit availability and home prices improve 

 

we are confident that the longterm fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets are positive we believe that our strong financial position together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands including kraftmaid and merillat cabinets delta and hansgrohe faucets behr paint and milgard windows our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles will allow us to drive longterm growth and create value for our shareholders

net sales of cabinets and related products decreased in 2009 primarily due to a decline in sales volume of cabinets in the new home construction and retail markets as well as a less favorable product mix which combined to reduce sales in this segment by approximately 24 percent compared to 2008 and 16 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 net sales in this segment were also negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of international operations which reduced sales in this segment by approximately three percent compared to 2008 and by approximately five percent in 2008 compared to 2007 such declines were partially offset by increased selling prices which increased sales by approximately one percent in 2009 compared to 2008 net sales in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume of cabinets in the new home construction market as well as a decline in net sales of readytoassemble cabinets a stronger us dollar decreased sales by two percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a weaker us dollar increased sales by one percent in 2008 compared to 2007

net sales of plumbing products decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume to north american retailers and wholesalers which reduced sales by approximately ten percent in both 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007 reflecting the weakened global economy net sales in this segment in 2009 and 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower local currency sales volume of international operations which reduced sales in this segment by approximately six percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and by approximately three percent in 2008 compared to 2007 such declines were partially offset by net selling price increases which increased sales by approximately three percent in both 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007 net sales in this segment in 2007 were positively affected by increased sales volume of certain international operations as well as increased selling prices which were partially offset by declining sales volume to north american retail and wholesale customers a stronger us dollar decreased sales by three percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a weaker us dollar increased sales by two percent in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

operating profit margins in the plumbing products segment in 2009 were positively affected by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as a more favorable product mix and the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by the decline in north american and international sales volume which reduced operating profit margins by approximately one percentage point compared to 2007 such declines were partially offset by net selling price increases operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs in early 2007 which were offset by selling price increases and the reduction of certain variable expenses as well as lower rationalization costs 

 

  

net sales of installation and other services decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to significantly lower sales volume related to the decline in the new home construction market which declined over 38 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as lower selling prices net sales in this segment in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume related to the slowdown in the new home construction market and declines in selling prices partially offset by acquisitions

operating profit margins in the decorative architectural products segment in 2009 were positively affected by increased sales volume of paints and stains which more than offset lower sales volume of builders’ hardware the operating profit margins in this segment also benefited from the improved 

relationship between selling prices and commodity costs related to paints and stains and builders’ hardware as well as lower program costs related to builders’ hardware operating profit margins in this segment in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of paints and stains and builders’ hardware increasing material costs throughout 2008 and program costs for builders’ hardware which more than offset the effect of selling price increases operating profit margins in this segment in 2007 primarily reflect increased sales volume of paints and stains offset by increased advertising expenses

geographic area results discussion 

 

  

north american net sales in 2009 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services cabinets and windows in the new home construction market which decreased sales from north american operations by approximately 12 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 in addition north american net sales were negatively affected by lower retail sales volume of cabinets plumbing products builder’s hardware and staple gun tackers and other fastening tools which aggregated to a net decrease in north american net sales of approximately nine percent in 2009 compared to 2008 such declines were partially offset by increased sales of paints and stains and increased selling prices for certain products north american net sales in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services cabinets and windows and doors in the new home construction market which decreased sales from north american operations by approximately 13 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 in addition north american net sales were negatively affected by lower retail sales volume of cabinets plumbing products paints and stains and builder’s hardware which aggregated to a net decrease in north american sales of approximately eight percent in 2008 compared to 2007 north american sales in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services cabinets and windows and doors in the new home construction market as well as lower retail sales volume of certain products partially offset by increased retail sales volume of paints and stains 

 

the declines in operating profit margins from north american operations in 2009 were primarily due to sales volume declines and the related underabsorption of fixed costs selling price decreases and a less 

favorable product mix in new home construction markets which decreased operating profit margins by one percentage point in 2009 compared to 2008 operating profit margins were also negatively affected by increased rationalization costs and charges in 2009 compared to 2008 such declines were partially offset by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs for cabinets plumbing products and paints and stains as well as the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives the declines in operating profit margins from north american operations in 2008 were primarily due to declines in new home construction and consumer spending which negatively impacted the sales volume of the company’s products and decreased operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007 the operating profit margins from north american operations in 2007 were negatively affected by declines in new home construction and consumer spending such declines were partially offset by selling price increases and the benefits associated with the company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives 

 

  

net sales from international operations decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower sales volume of plumbing products and cabinets which reduced sales from international operations in local currencies by approximately 12 percent compared to 2008 and by approximately 13 percent in 2008 compared to 2007 such declines were partially offset by selling price increases which increased sales from international operations by approximately two percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008 compared to 2007 net sales from international operations in 2007 were positively affected by increased sales volume of plumbing products a stronger us dollar decreased international net sales by seven percent in 2009 compared to 2008 and a weaker us dollar increased international net sales by three percent in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

operating profit margins in 2009 were positively affected by the improved relationship between selling prices and commodity costs as well as the benefits associated with business rationalizations and other cost savings initiatives operating profit margins in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volumes and the related underabsorption of fixed costs as well as increased severance and plant closure costs operating profit margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix and material cost increases

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2009 the fasb issued guidance regarding how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting should be consolidated the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on among other things an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance this guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1 2010 the company does not expect that the adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations

over the past several years the company has been focused on the strategic rationalization of its businesses including business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions system implementations and other initiatives as a result of the recent dramatic downturn in the home improvement and new home construction markets the company has implemented several plant closures in addition the company has idled two cabinet plants and one window plant since 2006 the company has closed over 80 locations formerly operated by its installation and other services segment including closing 29 such locations in 2008

except as the context otherwise indicates the terms “masco” and the “company” refer to masco corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

 

cabinets and related products 

 

in north america the company manufactures and sells economy stock semicustom assembled and readytoassemble cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points in europe the company manufactures and sells assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment cabinetry these products are sold under a number of trademarks including kraftmaid ®  distinctions ®  tvilumscanbirk tm and woodgate ® primarily to dealers and home centers and under the names merillat ®  moores tm and quality cabinets ® primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home improvement and new home construction markets cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major home improvement products a significant portion of our sales for the home improvement market is made through home center retailers 

 

recently the company has intensified its focus on lean manufacturing principles and is moving toward a more flexible and scalable manufacturing capability the related goal of the cabinet and related products segment is to be able to manufacture a common base cabinet at all of its plants that principally manufacture cabinets for the new home construction market this approach is intended to allow the company to strengthen cabinet production efficiencies at lower volumes and to respond effectively to increased demand when the new home construction market improves 

 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and europe is highly competitive with several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in addition to price the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs product features and selection significant north american competitors include american woodmark corporation fortune brands inc and cardell cabinetry 

 

plumbing products 

 

the company sells a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or for the company the company’s plumbing products are sold in north america and europe under various brand names including delta ®  peerless ®  hansgrohe ®  brasstech ®  brizo ®  bristan tm  damixa ®  newport brass ®  axor ®  alsons ®  sirrus ® and plumb shop ®  products include single and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers and valves which are sold by manufacturers’ representatives and company sales personnel to major retail accounts and to distributors who sell these products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others 

 

masco believes that its faucet operations are among the leaders in sales in the north american market with american standard kohler moen and price pfister as major brand competitors the company also has several major competitors among the european manufacturers primarily in germany and italy including friedrich grohe the company faces significant competition from private label 

products including house brands sold by certain of the company’s customers many of the faucet and showering products with which the company’s products compete are manufactured in asia the businesses in the company’s plumbing products segment source products from asia and manufacture products in the united states europe the united kingdom and asia 

 

other plumbing products manufactured and sold by the company include aqua glass ®  mirolin ® and american shower  bath tm acrylic and gelcoat bath and shower enclosure units shower trays and laundry tubs which are sold primarily to wholesale plumbing distributors and home center retailers for the north american home improvement and new home construction markets the company’s spas are manufactured and sold under hot spring ®  caldera ® and other trademarks directly to independent dealers major competitors include kohler lasco maax and jacuzzi hÜppe ® and breuer tm shower enclosures are sold by the company through wholesale channels and home centers primarily in western europe heritage tm ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally sold in the united kingdom directly to selected retailers 

 

also included in the plumbing products segment are brass and copper plumbing system components and other plumbing specialties which are sold to plumbing heating and hardware wholesalers and to home center retailers hardware stores building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers these products are marketed in north america for the wholesale trade under the brasscraft ® and brasstech trademarks and for the “doityourself” market under the master plumber ® and plumb shop trademarks and are also sold under private label 

 

in addition to price the company believes that competition in its plumbing products markets is based largely on brand reputation product quality product features and breadth of product offering 

 

a substantial portion of the company’s plumbing products are made from brass the major components of which are copper and zinc from time to time the company has encountered volatility in the price of brass the company is considering a hedging strategy to attempt to minimize the impact of commodity price volatility in addition legislation enacted in california and vermont to become effective in january 2010 mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in those states similar legislation may be considered by other states faucet and water supply valve manufacturers including the company will be required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets an increase in the demand for leadfree brass may cause a shortage of supply and resulting price increases and could adversely impact this segment’s operating results 

 

in 2008 the company’s delta faucet business introduced a new water delivery system known as diamond tm seal technology diamond tm seal technology which replaces existing valve technology reduces the number of potential leak points in a faucet simplifies installation and satisfies the legislation enacted in california and vermont regulating the acceptable lead content in plumbing products delta faucet in the near term plans to incorporate diamond tm seal technology into its domestically manufactured singlehandle faucets and in the future plans to expand the application of the technology to most other delta faucets the success of diamond tm seal technology depends on many factors including the performance of the technology and the market’s acceptance of the technology as well as delta’s ability to integrate successfully the technology into its most popular faucets 

 

installation and other services 

 

the company’s installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home construction market and to a lesser extent the commercial construction market throughout the united states in light of the current economic environment in the new home construction industry the company has decided to deemphasize the installation of certain noninsulation building products that are not core to its service offering including windows and paint in addition to insulation our current offering of installed building products primarily consists of gutters fireplaces garage doors and framing components the installation and distribution of insulation comprised approximately 11 percent 12 percent and 15 percent of the 

company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively distributed products include insulation insulation accessories gutters roofing and fireplaces installed building products are supplied primarily to custom and production homebuilders by the company’s network of branches located in most major markets throughout the united states distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers from distribution centers in various parts of the united states 

 

in addition to price the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service and the quality of installation service the company believes that it is the largest national provider of installed insulation in the new home construction industry in the united states competitors include several regional contractors as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards the company believes that its financial resources are substantial compared to regional and local contractors 

 

the installation and other services segment is a laborintensive business significant changes in federal state and local regulations addressing immigration and wages as well as collective bargaining arrangements affecting wages and working conditions could adversely affect the financial performance of the company’s business 

 

decorative architectural products 

 

the company manufactures architectural coatings including paints specialty paint products stains varnishes and waterproofing products the products are sold in the united states and canada under the brand names behr ®  kilz ®  casual colors ® and expressions ® to the “doityourself” and professional markets through home centers paint stores and other retailers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 15 percent 13 percent and 12 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic sherwinwilliams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality technology and product innovation customer service and brand reputation 

 

the behr brand is sold through the home depot the segment’s and the company’s largest customer the paint departments at the home depot stores include the behr color center and computer kiosk with the color smart by behr ® computerized colormatching system that enables consumers to select and coordinate their paintcolor selection the loss of the segment’s sales to the home depot would have a material adverse effect on the segment’s business and on the company as a whole 

 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand and from production capacity limitations petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil and natural gas lead to higher raw material costs eg for resins solvents and packaging as well as titanium dioxide which can adversely affect the segment’s results of operations 

 

the decorative architectural products segment also includes liberty ® cabinet door window and other hardware which is manufactured for the company and sold to home centers other retailers original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets key competitors in north america include amerock belwith umbra and stanley decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names franklin brass ® and decor bathware ® to distributors home center retailers and other retailers competitors include moen and globe union

 item 1a risk factors 

 

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that have affected and may continue to affect our business these risks and uncertainties have negatively impacted our current results and could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the effect on us of certain of these risk factors is discussed below under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 

 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement and new home construction activity levels both of which are experiencing a significant downturn 

 

a significant portion of our business relies on home improvement including repair and remodeling and new home construction activity levels principally in north america and europe the new home construction market which is cyclical in nature is undergoing a significant downturn marked by declines in the demand for new homes an oversupply of new and existing homes on the market and a reduction in the availability of financing for homebuyers the oversupply of existing homes has been exacerbated by a growing number of home mortgage foreclosures which is further contributing to downward pressure on home prices 

 

unlike most previous cyclical declines in new home construction in which we did not experience comparable declines in our home improvement businesses the current economic decline is adversely affecting our home improvement businesses as well low levels of consumer confidence and the downward pressure on home prices have made it much more difficult for homeowners to make additional investments in existing homes such as kitchen and bath remodeling projects further recent disruptions in credit markets have limited the ability of consumers to finance home improvements 

 

although we believe the longterm outlook for the home improvement and new home construction markets is favorable we cannot provide any assurances that current market conditions will not deteriorate further and we cannot predict the timing or strength of a recovery in these markets continued depressed activity levels in consumer spending for home improvement and new home construction will continue to adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position furthermore continued economic turmoil may cause unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices and in the business models and strategies of our customers such shifts may alter the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our operating performance 

 

continued disruption in the financial markets could harm our business 

 

we our customers and end consumers rely on stable and efficient financial markets the credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced significant disruptions characterized by 

the bankruptcy and failure of several financial institutions and severe limitations on credit availability the disruptions in the financial markets have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our operations in a variety of ways the financial stability of certain of our customers has been negatively impacted which has resulted in increased bad debt expense for us a prolonged continuation of adverse economic conditions would cause additional financial distress for our customers and could compromise the financial condition of our suppliers which could result in nonperformance by certain of our suppliers in addition our own borrowing costs are increasing and our access to capital markets may be reduced in december 2008 our senior debt ratings were lowered by two credit rating agencies including by one agency to below investment grade as a result of the general deterioration in financial markets as well as the lowering of our credit ratings costs under our existing credit facilities have increased and may continue to increase and it may become more difficult for us to obtain financing to fund operations or to refinance our existing debt obligations further the dramatic deterioration in general economic conditions over the past several months has resulted in the decline in the value of our investments in debt and equity securities including the assets held in our pension plans 

 

a prolonged economic downturn would reduce our financial resources and flexibility 

 

the valuation of assets on our balance sheet particularly goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses the reduced expectations of future performance have caused us to recognize impairment charges for certain longlived assets including goodwill and a continuation of the adverse conditions in our markets may result in additional impairment charges and a reduction in our shareholders’ equity in the future 

 

such a reduction in our shareholders’ equity and other adverse effects of a prolonged economic downturn on our results of operations and financial position would reduce our financial resources and flexibility and increase the relative impact on the company of other developments that otherwise affect us 

 

we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 

 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated or exited the business larger customers can effect significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and services our costs of doing business with them and the terms and conditions on which we do business further as discussed above during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers may impact the volume of our business the credit risk involved and our terms of doing business with them sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial in 2008 sales to our largest customer the home depot were 21 billion approximately 21 percent of our consolidated net sales lowe’s is our second largest customer in 2008 our sales to lowe’s were less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales although homebuilders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for our products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of our sales to lowe’s would have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts between our existing distribution channels have occurred and will continue to occur in addition we may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale channels as we increase the amount of business we transact directly with our larger customers in addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may affect the products we can offer to other customers 

our principal markets are highly competitive 

 

the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive and in recent years competition has intensified significantly competition is further exacerbated during economic downturns home center retailers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers particularly lowcost suppliers in asia for sale as private label and house brand merchandise also home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and installers we believe that competition in our industries is based largely on price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features and innovation although the relative importance of such factors varies among customers and product categories price is often a primary factor 

 

in addition to the challenges we are facing as a result of the current economic downturn our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and product development and innovation 

 

the cost and availability of materials and the performance of our supply chain affect our operating results 

 

it has been and likely will continue to be difficult for us to pass on to customers cost increases for commodities or other materials that are major components of our products or services in addition we may incur substantial costs as part of our strategy to hedge against price volatility of certain commodities we purchase and we may make commitments to purchase supplies at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices delays in adjusting or in our inability to adjust selling prices may be due to factors such as our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases further when commodity prices decline we receive pressure from our customers to reduce prices for our products and services changes in energy costs and certain commodities not only impact our production costs but also the cost to transport our products 

 

we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 

 

we rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain of our products or key components if there is an interruption in these sources of supply we may experience difficulty or delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be disrupted 

 

international political monetary economic and social developments affect our business 

 

over 20 percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds in addition we manufacture products in asia and source products and components from third parties in asia our international business faces risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices also impact our international business our international operating results may be influenced when compared to our north american results in part due to relative economic conditions in the european markets and due to competitive pricing pressures on certain products the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations 

in currency exchange rates which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance 

 

we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 

 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale securities including marketable and auction rate securities and a number of private equity funds since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation in addition we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 

 

product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 

 

we are subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability including putative class actions product liability claims can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend also we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell as a result of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

 

we have experienced putative class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability and wage and hour issues we have generally denied liability and have vigorously defended these cases however even when there is no basis for imposing liability such lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve due to their scope and complexity and the potentially significant exposure that is alleged 

 

increasingly homebuilders including our customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install these claims often asserted several years after completion of construction frequently result in lawsuits against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including us and require us to incur defense costs even when our products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

 

see note u to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

 

government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 

 

government regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees as well as consumers and environmental concerns continue to emerge domestically as well as internationally in addition to having to comply with current requirements including requirements that do not become effective until a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future compliance with these regulations such as the restrictions on lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our businesses may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing such actions could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing and product design and innovation and as we consider entering new international markets skilled personnel familiar with these markets we compete with multinational firms for these employees and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing motivating and retaining them the failure to attract develop motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

executive level overview 

 

the company manufactures distributes and installs home improvement and building products these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers home builders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 

 

during 2008 the company experienced a significant decline in its markets including a decline in new home construction of over 30 percent from 2007 as well as a continued decline in consumer spending for home improvement products the company’s net sales decreased 17 percent in 2008 from 2007 and the company’s operating profit as adjusted to exclude impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets general corporate expense net gains on sale of fixed assets net and 2008 charge for litigation settlement declined to 72 percent of sales in 2008 from 117 percent of sales in 2007 

 

factors that affect the company’s results of operations include the levels of home improvement activity and new home construction principally in north america and europe the importance of and the company’s relationships with key customers including the home depot which represented approximately 21 percent of the company’s net sales in 2008 the company’s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its us and global markets in the face of increasing competition and the company’s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure including the cost and availability of labor and materials if the current market conditions including the rate of consumer spending for home improvement products and new home construction continue or deteriorate further the company’s results of operations would continue to be negatively impacted the company cannot provide any assurances that current market conditions affecting the home improvement and new home construction markets will not deteriorate further and the company cannot predict the timing or strength of a recovery in these markets the company’s international businesses face political monetary economic and other risks that vary from country to country as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates further the company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk particularly in the current uncertain economic and credit market conditions in addition product liability claims and other litigation could be costly these and other factors are discussed in more detail in item 1a “risk factors” of this report 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 

the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

 

  

the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered the company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments in addition the company monitors its customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and the company has incurred additional bad debt expense related to customer defaults the company’s bad debt expense was 41 million 29 million and 16 million at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

in north america the company manufactures products principally windows doors and cabinets and provides installation of insulation and other services to homebuilders the company’s bad debt expense related to homebuilders was 28 million 23 million and 8 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

  

inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

 

  

on january 1 2008 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” for its financial assets and liabilities sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 defines fair value as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” sfas no 157 further defines a fair value hierarchy for measurement and disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as follows level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs as observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data and level 3 inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 

 

financial investments that are available to be traded on readily accessible stock exchanges domestic or foreign are considered to have active markets and have been valued using level 1 inputs financial 

investments that are not available to be traded on a public market or have limited secondary markets or contain provisions that limit the ability to sell the investment are considered to have inactive markets and have been valued using level 2 or 3 inputs the company incorporated credit risk into the valuations of financial instruments by estimating the likelihood of nonperformance by the counterparty to the applicable transactions the estimate included the length of time relative to the contract financial condition of the counterparty and current market conditions the criteria for estimating if a market was active or inactive were based on the individual facts and circumstances 

 

the company has maintained investments in availableforsale securities and a number of private equity funds which aggregated 101 million and 138 million respectively at december 31 2008 investments in availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax effect through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in the company’s consolidated balance sheet the fair value of the company’s investments in availableforsale securities is estimated using primarily level 1 inputs the fair value of the company’s investment in asahi tec preferred stock is estimated using a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if the company changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 100 basis points the value of the asahi tec preferred stock would change by approximately four percent 

 

the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary during 2008 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges of 31 million related to its investment in trimas common stock and 1 million related to its investment in asahi tec common stock 

 

in the past the company invested excess cash in auction rate securities auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7 28 or 35 days at december 31 2008 the company’s investment in auction rate securities was 22 million the company has not increased its investment in auction rate securities since 2007 the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated based on a discounted cash flow model level 3 input if the company changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by 75 basis points the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately 1 million 

 

the company’s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost it is not practicable for the company to estimate a fair value because the private equity funds have no quoted market price and sufficient information is not readily available for the company to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund these investments are evaluated quarterly for potential otherthantemporary impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment impairment indicators the company considers include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates industry and sector performance current equity and credit market conditions and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value the company also considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund including industry and sector performance the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential otherthantemporary impairment include current economic conditions market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in the automotive and transportation residential and commercial construction biotechnology health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds’ investments operate 

 

at december 31 2008 the company had investments in 17 venture capital funds with an aggregate carrying value of 33 million the venture capital funds invest in startup or smaller earlystage established businesses principally in the information technology biotechnology and health care sectors at december 31 2008 the company also has investments in 29 buyout funds with an aggregate carrying 

value of 105 million the buyout funds invest in laterstage established businesses and other than the heartland industrial partners fund “heartland fund” which is primarily in the automotive and transportation sector no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 

 

since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments the timing of distributions from the funds which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments as well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash can be difficult to predict as a result the amount of income that is recorded from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 

 

during 2008 as a result of the company’s review of its private equity investments the company determined that the heartland fund was negatively impacted by the 2008 decline in north american automotive production and the expected continued decline in automotive production in 2009 in addition five funds with limited exposure to the residential and commercial construction markets were negatively impacted by the 2008 decline in housing starts and the expected continued decline in 2009 as well as a slowdown in commercial construction these conditions resulted in the impairment of certain investments within these five funds during 2008 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 23 million related to these investments in private equity funds therefore these six funds now have a carrying value of 43 million at december 31 2008 if automotive production were to decline further than expected in 2009 or continue for a period of time at lower than normal historical production rates the heartland fund could have an additional impairment charge in a range of 15 million the company expects that a continued decline in the residential and commercial construction markets would not have a significant impact on the five private equity funds that recorded an impairment charge in 2008 as their remaining investments are diversified outside the residential and commercial construction sectors 

 

  

the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method the company selected the discounted cash flow methodology as the company believes that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants the company has defined its reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level as defined by sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” the company’s operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information including fiveyear forecasts are available 

 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates the company’s judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes in estimating future cash flows the company relies on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast the company generally develops these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 

in 2008 for its reporting units that primarily sell to the new home construction market including those in the installation and other services segment the company utilized estimated housing starts growing from current levels to 155 million in 2013 terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical margins for those business units by 2013 terminal growth year the housing starts projections were obtained from independent industry sources and discounted by approximately ten percent in 2007 the company estimated housing starts growing from 10 million units in 2008 to 175 million units in 2012 terminal growth year in 2008 and 2007 the company generally utilized its weighted average cost of capital discount rate of approximately nine percent to discount the estimated cash flows due to the market conditions in 2008 the company increased the discount rate for certain of its reporting units based upon a review of the current risks impacting its businesses 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 

 

if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

 

in 2008 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 456 million 438 million after tax the pretax impairment charges related to three of the company’s united kingdom manufacturers and distributors recorded in 2008 were as follows cabinets and related products segment – 59 million plumbing products segment – 203 million and other specialty products segment – 143 million these impairment charges reflect the anticipated longterm outlook for the reporting units including declining demand for certain products as well as decreased operating profit margins the pretax impairment charge in the installation and other services segment related to a small installation service reporting unit in north america was 51 million and reflects a decline in the reporting unit’s anticipated longterm outlook 

 

a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units at december 31 2008 would have resulted in a step two analysis and probable goodwill impairment for one reporting unit in the cabinets and related products segment one reporting unit in the installation and other services segment and one reporting unit in the other specialty products segment 

 

the company reviews its other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit the company considers the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm in 2008 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for other indefinitelived intangible assets of 11 million 7 million after tax the pretax impairment charges recorded in 2008 were as follows installation and other services segment – 1 million and other specialty products segment – 10 million 

 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

  

the company’s 2005 long term stock incentive plan the “2005 plan” provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms to employees and nonemployee directors at december 31 2008 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of longterm stock awards stock options phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 

 

the company elected to begin recording expense for stock options granted or modified subsequent to january 1 2003 effective january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” using the modified prospective application “mpa” method the mpa method requires the company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to january 1 2003 through the remaining vesting periods the mpa method did not require the restatement of prioryear information in accordance with sfas no 123r the company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock options as of the date of adoption 

 

  

longterm stock awards are granted to key employees and nonemployee directors of the company and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as the company continues the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market the company measures compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of the company’s common stock at the grant date there was 155 million eight million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december 31 2008 which was included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings effective january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards typically 10 years except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older which vest over five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 for stock awards granted prior to january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized over the vesting period of the stock awards typically 10 years or for executive grantees that are or will become retirementeligible during the vesting period the expense is being recognized over five years or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement pretax compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was 43 million for 2008 

 

  

stock options are granted to key employees and nonemployee directors of the company the exercise price equals the market price of the company’s common stock at the grant date these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date the 2005 plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options except for restoration options resulting from options granted under the company’s previous plan restoration stock options become exercisable six months from the date of grant 

 

the company measures compensation expense for stock options using a blackscholes option pricing model for stock options granted subsequent to january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options typically five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 the expense for unvested stock options at january 1 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a blackscholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock options typically five years pretax compensation expense for stock options was 36 million for 2008 

 

the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2008 riskfree interest rate – 325 dividend yield – 496 volatility factor – 3200 and expected option life – 6 years for sfas no 123r calculation purposes the 

weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares including restoration options granted in 2008 was 372 per option share 

 

if the company increased its assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2008 would increase 64 percent if the company decreased its assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2008 would decrease 69 percent 

 

  

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses the company considers current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

in 2008 the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to an average of 610 percent from 625 percent the discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the december 31 2008 citigroup pension discount curve such rates for the company’s definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 750 percent to 225 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 600 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 800 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

 

the company’s net underfunded amount for its qualified definedbenefit pension plans the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 344 million at december 31 2008 from 114 million at december 31 2007 primarily due to a decline in asset values in accordance with sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” the underfunded amount has been recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 and 2007 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2008 had a net loss of approximately 33 percent compared to average losses of 25 percent for the corporate funds universe within the independent consultant cooperative 

 

the company’s projected benefit obligation for its unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 147 million at december 31 2008 compared with 138 million at december 31 2007 in accordance with sfas no 158 the unfunded amount has been recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

the company expects pension expense for its qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 49 million in 2009 compared with 14 million in 2008 if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by 50 basis points the 2009 pension expense would increase by 7 million the company expects pension expense for its nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 12 million in 2009 compared with 13 million in 2008 

 

given the significant market decline in asset values for the company’s qualified defined benefit pension plans the company has several funding options and credits available and anticipates that it will be required to increase its funding to meet erisa requirements by between 16 million and 35 million in 2009 

  

the company has considered potential sources of future taxable income in determining the amount of a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december 31 2008 should the company determine that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in the company’s effective tax rate 

 

historically the company established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas 5 “accounting for contingencies” “sfas no 5” under this standard reserves for tax contingencies were established when it was probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin no 48” fin no 48 allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the adoption of fin no 48 was effective january 1 2007 

 

fin no 48 establishes a lower threshold than sfas no 5 for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions referred to by fin no 48 as “unrecognized tax benefits” therefore the company believes that there is a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with sfas no 5 

 

while the company believes it has adequately provided for its uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

 

  

certain of the company’s products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the time of sale the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations the company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 

 

the majority of the company’s business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the company the company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 

 

the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel when estimates of the company’s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 5 amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments see note u to the company’s consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings involving the company 

corporate development strategy 

 

in past years acquisitions have enabled the company to build strong positions in the markets it serves and have increased the company’s importance to its customers the company’s more recent focus includes the rationalization of its business units including consolidations as well as pursuing synergies among the company’s business units the company expects to maintain a more balanced growth strategy with emphasis on organic growth and fewer acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested capital as part of its strategic planning the company continues to review all of its businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to the company’s longterm growth strategy 

 

during 2008 the company determined that several european business units were not core to the company’s longterm growth strategy and accordingly embarked on a plan of disposition in separate transactions the company completed the sale of three business units in europe including two in the plumbing products segment and one in the other specialty products segment the company recorded an impairment of assets related to these discontinued operations which primarily included the writedown of goodwill of 24 million and other assets of 21 million the company recognized a net gain of 3 million in 2008 primarily related to the 2008 discontinued operations 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company accounted for the business units which were sold in 2008 2007 and 2006 as discontinued operations there were no businesses held for sale at december 31 2008 see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

during 2008 the company acquired a relatively small countertop business cabinet and related products segment this business which allows the company to expand the products and services it offers to its customers had annual sales of over 40 million the results of this acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition the aggregate net purchase price for this acquisition was 20 million and included cash of 18 million and future cash payments of 2 million 

 

during 2007 the company acquired several relatively small installation service businesses installation and other services segment as well as erickson construction company and guy evans inc installation and other services segment the results of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

historically the company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of company common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 

 

maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the company’s financial strategies the company’s total debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to 58 percent at december 31 2008 from 50 percent at december 31 2007 the increase is primarily due to the decline in shareholders’ equity due to share repurchases the decline in the fair value of pension assets the effect of currency translation and the net loss including impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2008 

 

bank credit lines are maintained to provide for the availability of funds at december 31 2008 the company had a 20 billion fiveyear revolving credit agreement with a group of banks syndicated in the united states and internationally which expires in february 2011 this agreement allows for borrowings denominated in us dollars or european euros with interest payable based upon various floatingrate options as selected by the company at december 31 2008 there are no amounts outstanding under the fiveyear revolving credit facility and there are no current plans to utilize this facility in light of the recent financial market turmoil the company has confirmed with jpmorgan chase bank the agent for this facility that the obligations of merrill lynch and wachovia bank as participating lenders under this facility have been assumed by bank of america and wells fargo bank respectively in 

connection with the completion of the transactions to combine these entities both bank of america and wells fargo bank were already participating lenders under the company’s credit facility 

 

the fiveyear revolving credit agreement as amended contains limitations on additional borrowings related to the debt to total capitalization requirements at december 31 2008 the company had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 284 million the fiveyear revolving credit agreement also contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth at december 31 2008 the company’s net worth exceeded such requirement by 29 million based on the credit agreement the net worth covenant is adjusted on an annual basis on a pro forma basis as of january 1 2009 the company’s net worth including the minority interest reclassification of 135 million upon adoption of sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51” would have exceeded the requirement by approximately 980 million in addition at january 1 2009 the company could borrow approximately 480 million or absorb a reduction to shareholders’ equity of approximately 300 million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 

 

in order to borrow under the fiveyear revolving credit agreement there must not be any defaults in the company’s covenants in the credit agreement ie in addition to the two financial covenants principally limitations on subsidiary debt negative pledge restrictions legal compliance requirements and maintenance of insurance and the company’s representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects on the date of borrowing ie principally no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change in each case since december 31 2003 no material erisa or environmental noncompliance and no material tax deficiency the company was in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

a credit rating agency ie moody’s or standard and poor’s is an entity that assigns credit ratings for issuers of certain types of debt obligations in december 2008 one rating agency reduced the credit rating on the company’s debt to below investment grade as a result the zero coupon convertible senior notes “notes” are convertible on demand and the balance of 54 million has been classified as shortterm debt at december 31 2008 the company does not anticipate conversion of the notes since based on the terms it would not currently be profitable for holders of the notes to exercise the option to convert the notes also as a result of the downgrade the costs related to the fiveyear revolving credit agreement will be higher 

 

as a result of the general deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions as well as the lowering of the company’s credit ratings it may become difficult to obtain financing to fund operations or to refinance the company’s existing debt obligations 

 

the company had cash and cash investments of 1 billion at december 31 2008 principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations 

 

the company’s cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations while the company attempts to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk it is possible that the recent global turmoil in the financial markets could result in failures of additional financial institutions or other events and thereby affect the security or availability of these investments 

 

the company has maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds principally as part of its tax planning strategies as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses the company determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous to the company and complement the company’s investment in more liquid availableforsale and marketable securities to balance risk since the company has significantly reduced its capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources the company has and will continue to reduce its investments in longterm financial assets 

in 2008 the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend two percent to 235 per common share given the continued uncertainty in the global economic and financial markets the company will focus on liquidity preservation as a result the company’s management is recommending to the board of directors that the quarterly dividend be reduced from 235 per common share 94 per common share annually to 075 per common share 30 per common share annually 

 

during 2008 the company retired 100 million of 575 notes due october 15 2008 the scheduled maturity date the company has no further scheduled maturities of its longterm indebtedness until march 2010 when 300 million of its floating rate notes become due 

 

the company’s working capital ratio was 21 to 1 and 20 to 1 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

during 2004 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt in 2008 the company terminated these interest rate swap agreements covering a notional amount of 850 million of the company’s fixedrate debt due july 15 2012 with an interest rate of 5875 and received cash of 16 million these swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges and were considered 100 percent effective the gain of 16 million from the termination of these swaps is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt through july 2012 

 

the company including certain european operations has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar at december 31 2008 the company had also entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge currency fluctuations related to intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies

the company’s gross profit margins were 248 percent 273 percent and 275 percent in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the decrease in the 2008 and 2007 gross profit margins reflects declining sales volume and the related underabsorption of costs which more than offset net selling price increases and the benefits associated with the company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives

outlook for the company 

 

business conditions remain difficult in the company’s markets the company experienced a further significant reduction in sales of its products and services in the fourth quarter of 2008 which has continued into early 2009 housing starts declined over 30 percent to 900000 in 2008 from 2007 the company estimates that 2009 housing starts will decline approximately 35 percent to a range of 550000 to 600000 units the company anticipates that consumer spending for home improvement products and demand for certain of the company’s international products will continue to decline in the nearterm

the company believes that its financial position including cash of over 1 billion at december 31 2008 and its ability to generate cash flow together with its current strategy of investing in leadership brands innovative growth and flexible and scalable supply chains will allow the company to drive longterm growth and create value for our shareholders

the declines in operating profit margins from north american operations in 2008 and 2007 are primarily due to accelerating declines in new home construction and consumer spending which negatively impacted the sales volume of the company’s products and decreased operating profit margins by approximately three percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007 and approximately two percentage points in 2007 compared to 2006 the declines in 2007 were partially offset by selling price increases and the benefits associated with the company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives in 2006 the operating profit margins from north american operations reflected sales volume declines in the second half of 2006 of readytoassemble cabinets windows and doors and the installation of insulation products as well as increased commodity costs partially offset by selling price increases 

 

  

net sales from international operations decreased in 2008 primarily due to lower sales volume of plumbing products and cabinets which reduced sales from international operations in local currencies by approximately 13 percent compared to 2007 such declines were partially offset by selling price increases which increased sales from international operations by approximately two percent compared to 2007 net sales from international operations increased in 2007 primarily due to increased sales volume of plumbing products which increased sales from international operations in local currencies by five percent compared to 2006 a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the translation of international results in 2008 and 2007 increasing international net sales by three percent in 2008 compared to 2007 and ten percent in 2007 compared to 2006 net sales from international operations in 2006 reflect increased sales of plumbing products as well as a weaker us dollar which had a positive effect on the translation of european results 

 

operating profit margins in 2008 were negatively affected by lower sales volumes and the related underabsorption of fixed costs as well as increased severance and plant closure costs operating profit margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix and material cost increases operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the lower operating results for european readytoassemble cabinets which more than offset the positive effect of increased sales volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of other european operations

cabinets and related products 

 

in north america the company manufactures and sells economy stock semicustom assembled and readytoassemble cabinetry for kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points in europe the company manufactures and sells assembled and readytoassemble kitchen bath storage home office and home entertainment cabinetry these products are sold under a number of trademarks including kraftmaid ®  mill’s pride ®  tvilum scanbirk tm and woodgate tm primarily to dealers and home centers and under the names merillat ®  moores tm and quality cabinets ® primarily to distributors and homebuilders for both the home improvement and new home construction markets cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both new home construction and retail consumer spending particularly spending for major home improvement products a significant portion of our sales for the home improvement market are made through home center retailers 

 

the cabinet manufacturing industry in the united states and europe is highly competitive with several large competitors and numerous local and regional competitors in addition to price the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality responsiveness to customer needs and product features significant north american competitors include american woodmark corporation fortune brands inc and cardell cabinetry 

 

in 2007 the company completed additions to its north american cabinet manufacturing capacity which were undertaken in order to meet increased demand for cabinet products the anticipated benefits of the new capacity have not been realized due to the decline in new home construction and consumer spending activity since 2006 

 

plumbing products 

 

in north america the company sells a wide variety of faucet and showering devices that are manufactured by or for the company products are sold under various brand names including delta ®  peerless ®  hansgrohe ®  brasstech ®  brizo ®  newport brass ®  axor ®  alsons ® and plumb shop ®  products include single and doublehandle faucets showerheads handheld showers and valves which are sold by manufacturers’ representatives and company sales personnel to major retail accounts and to distributors who sell these products to plumbers building contractors remodelers smaller retailers and others the company sells kitchen and bath faucets showering devices and various other plumbing products for european markets under the brand names hansgrohe bristan tm  axor and damixa ®  which are sold through multiple distribution channels 

 

masco believes that its faucet operations are among the leaders in sales in the north american market with american standard kohler moen and price pfister as major brand competitors the company also has several major competitors among the european manufacturers primarily in germany and italy including friedrich grohe the company faces significant competition from private label products including house brands sold by certain of the company’s customers many of the faucet and showering products with which the company’s products compete are manufactured in asia as part of the company’s strategy for the plumbing products segment these businesses have been reducing the volume of products manufactured domestically and increasing their asian manufacturing and sourcing of products 

 

other plumbing products manufactured and sold by the company include aqua glass ®  mirolin ® and american shower  bath tm acrylic and gelcoat bath and shower enclosure units shower trays and laundry tubs which are sold primarily to wholesale plumbing distributors and home center retailers for the north american home improvement and new home construction markets the company’s spas are manufactured and sold under hot spring ®  caldera ® and other trademarks directly to independent dealers major competitors include kohler lasco maax and jacuzzi hÜppe ® and breuer tm shower enclosures are sold by the company through wholesale channels and home 

centers primarily in germany and western europe heritage tm ceramic and acrylic bath fixtures and faucets are principally sold in the united kingdom directly to selected retailers glass tm and pharo tm acrylic bathtubs and steam shower enclosures are also sold in europe 

 

also included in the plumbing products segment are brass and copper plumbing system components and other plumbing specialties which are sold to plumbing heating and hardware wholesalers and to home center retailers hardware stores building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers these products are marketed in north america for the wholesale trade under the brasscraft ® and brasstech trademarks and for the “doityourself” market under the master plumber ® and plumb shop trademarks and are also sold under private label 

 

in addition to price the company believes that competition in its plumbing products markets is based largely on brand reputation product quality product features and breadth of product offering 

 

a substantial portion of the company’s plumbing products are made from brass the major components of which are copper and zinc from time to time the company has encountered volatility in the price of brass in addition legislation enacted in california to become effective in january 2010 mandates new standards for acceptable lead content in plumbing products sold in california similar legislation is being considered by other states faucet manufacturers including the company will be required to obtain adequate supplies of leadfree brass or suitable alternative materials for continued production of faucets an increase in the demand for leadfree brass may cause a shortage of supply and resulting price increases and could adversely impact this segment’s operating results 

 

installation and other services 

 

the company’s installation and other services segment sells installed building products and distributes building products primarily to the new home construction industry and to a lesser extent the commercial construction market throughout the united states historically the company concentrated on the installation and distribution of insulation which comprised approximately 12 percent 15 percent and 15 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively net sales of noninsulation products both installed and distributed in 2007 represented approximately 46 percent of the segment’s net sales our offering of installed building products includes insulation cabinetry gutters fireplaces garage doors and framing components distributed products include insulation insulation accessories gutters roofing cabinetry and fireplaces collaboration with other company businesses has resulted in sales of installed company products such as cabinetry windows paint and bath accessories installed building products are sold primarily to custom and production homebuilders by the company’s network of branch locations throughout most of the united states distributed products are sold primarily to contractors and dealers from distribution centers in various parts of the united states as discussed under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” sales and operating results for the installation and other services segment are significantly affected by the level of new home construction activity 

 

in addition to price the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on customer service range of products and services offered and quality of installation service the company believes it is the largest national provider of installed insulation in the united states competitors include several regional contractors as well as numerous local contractors and lumber yards 

 

the company buys insulation from a limited number of large suppliers in the united states market historically during periods of rapid growth in the new home construction market the industry has encountered shortages of insulation leading to price volatility and allocations of supply as one of the country’s largest purchasers of insulation the company has been able to successfully meet its needs in the past although the volatility of material costs does impact our financial performance 

the installation and other services segment is a laborintensive business significant changes in federal state and local regulations addressing immigration and wages as well as collective bargaining arrangements affecting wages and working conditions could adversely affect the financial performance of the company’s business 

 

decorative architectural products 

 

the company manufactures architectural coatings including paints specialty paint products stains varnishes and waterproofing products the products are sold in the united states and canada under the brand names behr ®  kilz ® and expressions ® to the “doityourself” and professional markets through home centers paint stores and other retailers behr products were also recently introduced in china the kilz brand is sold in north america through home center retailers and discount retailers and through hardware stores paint stores and dealers net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 13 percent 11 percent and 11 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively competitors in the architectural coatings market include large national and international brands such as benjamin moore glidden olympic sherwinwilliams valspar and zinsser as well as many regional and other national brands in addition to price the company believes that competition in this industry is based largely on product quality technology and product innovation customer service and brand reputation 

 

the behr brand is sold through the home depot the segment’s and the company’s largest customer the paint departments at the home depot stores include the behr color center and computer kiosk with the color smart by behr ® computerized colormatching system that enables consumers to select and coordinate their paintcolor selection the loss of the home depot as a customer would significantly impact the segment’s business and that of the company as a whole 

 

titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of paint shortages of supply and cost increases for titanium dioxide in the past have resulted from surges in global demand and from disruption of refining capacity ie hurricane katrina in the fall of 2005 similar events in the future could adversely impact the financial performance of the company’s business petroleum products are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings significant increases in the cost of crude oil lead to higher raw material costs ie for resins solvents packaging which can adversely affect the segment’s results of operations 

 

the decorative architectural products segment also includes liberty ® door window and other hardware which is manufactured for the company and sold to home centers other retailers original equipment manufacturers and wholesale markets key competitors in north america include amerock belwith umbra and stanley decorative bath hardware and shower accessories are sold under the brand names franklin brass ® and decor bathware ® to distributors home center retailers and other retailers competitors include moen and globe union

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect our company these risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the impact on our company of certain of these risk factors is discussed below under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our company should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events these developments could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 

a significant portion of our business relies on residential construction activity and general economic conditions 

 

a significant part of our business is affected by levels of home improvement including repair and remodeling and new home construction activity principally in north america and europe demographic factors such as changes in population growth and household formations affect levels of home improvement and new home construction over the long term significant factors that impact demand for home improvement and new home construction in the short term include the inventory levels of unsold new and existing homes general and regional economic conditions consumer confidence and credit terms and availability of financing affordability of homes interest rates energy costs and on a more localized basis weather conditions and natural disasters the new home construction market in particular is cyclical in nature a discussion of the impact of the decline in new home construction and in consumer spending for home improvement items on our various segments and on the company’s operating results is located under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under item 7 of this report 

 

we rely on key customers and may encounter conflicts within and between our distribution channels 

 

the size and importance of individual customers to our businesses has increased as customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated larger customers can effect significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which we do business further during downturns in our markets declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of significant customers may impact the volume of our business the credit risk involved and our terms of doing business with them sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial in 2007 sales to the company’s largest customer the home depot were 24 billion approximately 20 percent of the company’s consolidated net sales although builders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the company’s products and services the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot would have a material adverse impact on the company 

 

as some of our customers expand their markets and their targeted customers conflicts occur and in some instances we may also become their competitor increasingly we are transacting business directly with our larger customers these arrangements may undermine the business relationships we have with customers who purchase our products through traditional wholesale means in addition our large retail customers are increasingly requesting product exclusivity which may impact our product offerings to other customers 

 

our principal markets are becoming more competitive 

 

the major geographic markets for our products and services are highly competitive and in recent years competition has intensified significantly competition is further exacerbated during economic downturns home center retailers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers particularly lowcost suppliers in asia for sale as private label and house brand merchandise also home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers are increasingly turning their marketing efforts directly toward professional contractors and installers the company believes that competition in our industries is based largely on price product and service quality brand reputation customer service and product features although the relative importance of such factors varies among customers and product categories price is often a primary factor 

 

although we view the long term demographic trends for our markets as generally favorable our markets are mature cyclical and growing slowly additionally our market position in and the competitive composition of our traditional markets affect our ability to expand our market share in recent years we have directed our strategic focus to organic growth and on developing new products and 

expanding our services rather than on growth through acquisitions however our ability to maintain our competitive positions in our markets and to grow our businesses is challenged since it depends to a large extent upon successfully maintaining our relationships with major customers implementing growth strategies in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets capitalizing on and strengthening our brand names managing our cost structure accommodating shorter lifecycles for our products and identifying and effectively responding to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns through product development and innovation 

 

the importance of sophisticated information technology to our industry is increasing in order to remain competitive and respond to customer requirements and changes in their business processes such as inventory replenishment merchandise ordering transportation and payment processing the company must be able to identify and implement comprehensive enterprise resource planning “erp” systems erp systems are also critical to our supply chain management and logistics capabilities the successful implementation of erp systems also requires significant investment by the company of both time and capital difficulties encountered in the deployment of significant new systems and other technology could be disruptive to the operation of our businesses 

 

the cost and availability of materials and labor and the performance of our supply chain affect our operating results 

 

when we incur cost increases for commodities or materials that are major components of our products or services such as brass insulation or titanium dioxide it can be difficult for us to offset the impact on our operating results on a timely basis delays in adjusting or inability to adjust prices may be due to such factors as our existing arrangements with customers competitive considerations or customer resistance to such price increases when the number of available sources for raw materials is limited price volatility is more likely to occur and with longer duration when demand exceeds supply in addition to their impact on our production expenses increased costs of energy and other commodities such as crude oil can significantly affect the cost to transport our products and adversely affect our results of operations see “installation and other services” for a discussion of the impact of cost of raw materials and availability of labor and materials on that segment of our business 

 

we may also be adversely affected if our homebuilder customers encounter difficulty or delays in obtaining required materials from their other suppliers or if they encounter labor shortages this is particularly likely to occur during periods of rapid growth in the new home construction market under such circumstances homebuilders may delay their construction schedules and as a result may reduce or delay their purchase of products and services from us 

 

we rely heavily or exclusively on outside suppliers for certain of our products or key components if there is an interruption in these sources of supply we may experience difficulty or delay in substituting alternatives and our business may be disrupted 

 

international political economic and social developments impact our business 

 

over 20 percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds our international business faces risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments local labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights the financial reporting of our consolidated operating results is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period and in forecasting future performance us laws affecting activities of us companies doing business abroad including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices also impact our international business our international operating results may be influenced when compared to our north american results in part due to relative economic conditions in the european markets and due to competitive pricing pressures on certain products 

increasingly we are manufacturing in asia and sourcing products and components from third parties in asia the distances involved in these arrangements together with differences in business practices shipping and delivery requirements the limited number of suppliers and laws and regulations have increased the difficulty of managing our supply chain the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 

 

we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 

 

we have maintained investments in availableforsale securities including marketable and auction rate securities and a number of private equity funds since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments or the amounts realized upon liquidation in addition we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 

 

product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 

 

increasingly homebuilders including our customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install these claims frequently result in lawsuits against the homebuilders and many of their subcontractors including the company and require defense costs even when such products or services are not the principal basis for the claims 

 

we are also subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability including putative class actions product liability claims can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend also we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products that we sell because of the difficulty of controlling the quality of products or components sourced from other manufacturers we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers 

 

the company has experienced an increase in the number of putative class action lawsuits in recent years predicated upon claims for antitrust violations product liability wage and hour issues and other matters the company has generally denied liability and vigorously defends these cases however even when there is no basis for imposing liability on the company such lawsuits are particularly costly to resolve due to their scope complexity and the potentially significant exposure that is alleged 

 

see note t to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses 

 

government and industry responses to environmental and health and safety concerns could impact our capital expenditures and operating results 

 

government and other regulations pertaining to health and safety including protection of employees as well as consumers and environmental concerns continue to emerge domestically as well as internationally in addition to having to comply with current requirements including requirements that do not become effective until a future date even more stringent requirements could be imposed on our industries in the future compliance with these regulations such as the restrictions on lead content in plumbing products and on volatile organic compounds and formaldehyde emissions that are applicable to certain of our businesses may require us to alter our manufacturing and installation processes and our sourcing such actions could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to effectively and timely meet such regulations could adversely impact our competitive position 

the longterm performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract develop and retain talented management 

 

to be successful we must attract develop and retain highly qualified and talented personnel in management sales marketing research and development and as we enter new international markets skilled personnel familiar with these markets we compete with multinational firms in manufacturing and other industries for these employees and we invest significant resources in recruiting developing and motivating them the failure to attract motivate develop and retain key managers and other key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and our operating results

executive level overview 

 

the company manufactures distributes and installs home improvement and building products these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers builders distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions which are based upon historical experience as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 

 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

  

the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered the company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 

 

  

inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

 

  

the company has maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds which aggregated 114 million and 173 million respectively at december 31 2007 investments in availableforsale and marketable securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in the company’s consolidated balance sheet the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary during 2007 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges of 6 million related to its investment in furniture brands international common stock and 3 million related to its investment in asahi tec common stock 

 

from time to time the company invests its excess cash in shortterm financial instruments including auction rate securities auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every 7 28 or 35 days during the third quarter of 2007 the company revised the classification of investments in auction rate securities from cash and cash investments to availableforsale securities included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet the company has also made corresponding adjustments to the consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 to reflect the gross cash purchases and sales of these securities in cash flows for from investing activities these changes in classification do not affect previously reported consolidated statements of income or cash flows from operating activities in any prior period during 2007 the company recognized a noncash pretax impairment charge of 3 million related to auction rate securities 

 

on january 11 2007 the acquisition of metaldyne corporation “metaldyne” formerly mascotech inc by asahi tec corporation “asahi tec” a japanese automotive supplier was finalized the combined fair value of the asahi tec common and preferred stock as well as the derivative related to the conversion feature on the preferred stock received in exchange for the company’s investment in metaldyne was 72 million as a result of the transaction the company recognized a gain of 14 million net of transaction fees included in the company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2007 in income from other investments net subsequent to the transaction the company’s investment in asahi tec common and preferred stock is accounted for as availableforsale and unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value of the asahi tec common and preferred stock at december 31 2007 have been recognized net of tax through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in the company’s consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december 31 2007 the unrealized loss of 17 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative 

related to the conversion feature on the preferred stock has been included in income from other investments net 

 

in addition immediately prior to its sale metaldyne distributed shares of trimas corporation “trimas” common stock as a dividend to the holders of metaldyne common stock the company recognized income of 4 million included in the company’s consolidated statement of income in dividend income from other investments in may 2007 trimas made an initial public offering subsequent to the offering the company’s investment in trimas is accounted for as availableforsale and unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value of the investment have been recognized net of tax through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in the company’s consolidated balance sheet 

 

the company’s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for potential impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment impairment indicators the company considers include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation during 2007 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges of 10 million related to certain of its investments in private equity funds 

 

  

the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the fourth quarter of each year or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying amount the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method 

 

determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates the company’s judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome in estimating future cash flows the company relies on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast the company generally develops these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting business units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 

 

if the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its fair value the company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit including any 

previously unrecognized intangible assets the excess of the fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting business unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

 

in 2007 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 177 million 177 million after tax the pretax impairment charges recorded in 2007 were as follows plumbing products segment — 69 million related to a north american manufacturer of plumbingrelated products and other specialty products segment — 108 million related to a european manufacturer of heating products 

 

the company reviews its other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit the company considers the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the nearand longterm in 2007 the company recognized a noncash pretax impairment charge for other indefinitelived intangible assets of 50 million 31 million after tax in the other specialty products segment related to the value of a registered trademark 

 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

 

  

the company’s 2005 long term stock incentive plan the “2005 plan” replaced the 1991 long term stock incentive plan the “1991 plan” in may 2005 and provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms at december 31 2007 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of longterm stock awards stock options phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights additionally the company’s 1997 nonemployee directors stock plan the “1997 plan” provides for the payment of part of the compensation to nonemployee directors in company common stock the 1997 plan expired in may 2007 subsequently compensation to nonemployee directors in company common stock will be made from the 2005 plan 

 

the company elected to begin recording expense for stock options granted or modified subsequent to january 1 2003 effective january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” using the modified prospective application “mpa” method the mpa method requires the company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to january 1 2003 through the remaining vesting periods the mpa method did not require the restatement of prioryear information in accordance with sfas no 123r the company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock options as of the date of adoption 

 

  

longterm stock awards are granted to key employees and nonemployee directors of the company and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as the company continues the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market there was 175 million 9 million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december 31 2007 which was included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings effective january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards typically 10 years except for stock awards held by grantees age 66 or older which vest over five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 for stock awards granted prior to january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized over the vesting period of the stock awards typically 

10 years or for executive grantees that are or will become retirementeligible during the vesting period the expense is being recognized over five years or immediately upon a grantee’s retirement pretax compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was 52 million for 2007 

 

  

stock options are granted to key employees and nonemployee directors of the company the exercise price equals the market price of the company’s common stock at the grant date these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date the 2005 plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options except for restoration options resulting from options granted under the 1991 plan restoration stock options become exercisable six months from the date of grant 

 

the company measures compensation expense for stock options using a blackscholes option pricing model for stock options granted subsequent to january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options typically five years or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirementeligible at age 65 the expense for unvested stock options at january 1 2006 is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a blackscholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 for stock options granted prior to january 1 2006 such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock options typically five years pretax compensation expense for stock options was 49 million for 2007 

 

the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2007 riskfree interest rate – 474 dividend yield – 30 volatility factor – 318 and expected option life – 7 years for sfas no 123r calculation purposes the weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares including restoration options granted in 2007 was 892 per option share 

 

if the company increased its assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2007 would increase 48 percent if the company decreased its assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in 2007 would decrease 59 percent 

 

  

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses the company considers current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the company’s consolidated financial statements in any given period 

 

in 2007 the company increased its discount rate for obligations to an average of 625 percent from 550 percent the discount rate for obligations was based upon the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the december 31 2007 citigroup pension discount curve such rates for the company’s definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 500 percent to 650 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 625 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 825 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

 

the company’s net underfunded amount for its qualified definedbenefit pension plans the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 114 million at december 31 2007 from 186 million at december 31 2006 primarily due to asset returns and funding 

contributions in accordance with sfas no 158 the underfunded amount has been recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 and 2006 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2007 had a net return of approximately seven percent compared to average returns of six percent for the largest 1000 plan benchmark 

 

the company’s projected benefit obligation for its unfunded nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans was 138 million at december 31 2007 compared with 144 million at december 31 2006 in accordance with sfas no 158 the unfunded amount has been recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

the company expects pension expense for its qualified definedbenefit pension plans to be 13 million in 2008 compared with 17 million in 2007 if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return the 2008 pension expense would increase by 3 million the company expects pension expense for its nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to decrease by 1 million in 2008 compared with 2007 

 

  

the company has considered potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets related to its foreign tax credit carryforward of 45 million at december 31 2007 should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 

 

historically the company established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas 5 “accounting for contingencies” “sfas no 5” under this standard reserves for tax contingencies were established when it was probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin no 48” fin no 48 allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities the adoption of fin no 48 was effective january 1 2007 

 

fin no 48 establishes a lower threshold than sfas no 5 for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions referred to by fin no 48 as “unrecognized tax benefits” therefore the company believes that there is a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect our unrecognized tax benefits computation to a greater degree than with sfas no 5 

 

while the company believes it has adequately provided for its uncertain tax positions amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly additional provisions for taxrelated matters including interest and penalties could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 

 

  

certain of the company’s products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the time of sale the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations the company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 

a significant portion of the company’s business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the company the company’s revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 

 

the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel when estimates of the company’s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 5 amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments see note t to the company’s consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings involving the company 

 

corporate development strategy

historically the company has largely funded its growth through cash provided by a combination of its operations longterm bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets and by the issuance of company common stock including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 

 

bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds at december 31 2007 the company had a 20 billion 5year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks syndicated in the united states and internationally which expires in february 2011 this agreement allows for borrowings denominated in us dollars or european euros with interest payable based upon various floatingrate options as selected by the company there were no amounts outstanding under the 5year revolving credit agreement at december 31 2007 

 

the 5year revolving credit agreement contains limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2007 the company had additional borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 19 billion the 5year revolving credit agreement also contains a requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth at december 31 2007 the company’s net worth exceeded such requirement by 895 million 

 

the company had cash and cash investments of 922 million at december 31 2007 principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations 

 

the company has maintained investments in availableforsale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds principally as part of its tax planning strategies as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future tax capital losses the company determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous to the company and complement the company’s investment in more liquid availableforsale and marketable securities to balance risk since the company has significantly reduced tax capital losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources the company has and will continue to reduce its investments in financial assets 

 

in 2007 the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend five percent to 23 per common share this marks the 49th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 

 

maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the company’s financial strategies the company’s total debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to 50 percent at december 31 2007 from 53 percent at december 31 2006 the decrease in the company’s debt to total capitalization percent is primarily due to the repurchase of the zero coupon convertible senior notes in january 2007 

 

on january 20 2007 holders of 18 billion 94 percent principal amount at maturity of the company’s zero coupon convertible senior notes “notes” required the company to repurchase their notes at a cash value of 825 million at december 31 2007 there were outstanding 108 million principal amount at maturity of such notes with an accreted value of 52 million which has been 

included in longterm debt as the next put option date is july 20 2011 the company may at any time redeem all or part of the notes at their then accreted value 

 

during 2007 the company also retired 300 million of floatingrate notes due march 9 2007 and 300 million of 4625 notes due august 15 2007 on march 14 2007 the company issued 300 million of floatingrate notes due 2010 the interest rate is determined based upon the threemonth libor plus 30 basis points on march 14 2007 the company also issued 300 million of fixedrate 585 notes due 2017 these debt issuances provided net proceeds of 596 million and were in consideration of the march and august 2007 debt maturities 

 

the company’s working capital ratio was 20 to 1 and 15 to 1 at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the improvement in the company’s working capital ratio is primarily due to the january 2007 payment of 825 million to repurchase the zero coupon convertible senior notes which were included in shortterm notes payable at december 31 2006 

 

the derivatives used by the company during 2007 consist of interest rate swaps entered into in 2004 for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt generally under interest rate swap agreements the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and variablerate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss the interest rate swap agreements are designated as fairvalue hedges and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement for fairvalue hedge transactions changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings 

 

the average variable interest rates are based upon the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus fixed adjustment factors the average effective rate for 2007 on the interest rate swaps was 6264 at december 31 2007 the interest rate swap agreements covered a notional amount of 850 million of the company’s fixedrate debt due july 15 2012 with an interest rate of 5875 the hedges are considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item accordingly no gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the company’s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 in 2007 the company recognized an increase in interest expense of 3 million related to this swap agreement due to increasing interest rates 

 

certain of the company’s european operations also entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency fluctuations primarily related to the european euro the great britain pound and the us dollar

consolidated results of operations 

 

the company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in the united states however the company believes that certain nongaap performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods nongaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company’s reported results 

 

  

net sales for 2007 were 118 billion representing a decrease of seven percent from 2006 excluding results from acquisitions and the effect of currency translation net sales decreased 11 percent compared with 2006 the following table reconciles reported net sales to net sales excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation in millions 

 

 

 

net sales for 2007 were adversely affected by a continued decline in the new home construction market which reduced sales volume and contributed to a nine percent decline in net sales economic conditions remain difficult in the new home construction market fullyear housing starts have declined from 21 million in 2005 to 13 million in 2007 net sales for 2007 were also negatively affected by a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products which contributed to lower sales volume reducing net sales by two percent compared to 2006 retail sales volume benefited from increased sales volume of paints and stains and international plumbing products 

the company’s gross profit margins were 273 percent 276 percent and 285 percent in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in the 2007 gross profit margin reflects lower sales volume of certain products which more than offset the benefits associated with the company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives the decrease in the 2006 gross profit margins reflects increased commodity energy and freight costs as well as a less favorable product mix offset in part by increased selling prices for certain products 

 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 172 percent in 2007 compared with 161 percent in 2006 and 155 percent in 2005 selling general and administrative expenses in 2007 reflect lower sales volume as well as increased advertising costs of 29 percent of sales compared to 26 percent of sales in 2006 the year 2007 also includes increased severance costs of 16 million increased bad debt expense of 13 million and increased systems implementation costs of 7 million which on a combined basis increased 3 percent of sales compared to 2006 increased selling general and administrative expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 reflect increased stockbased compensation expense of 8 percent of sales compared to 6 percent of sales in 2005 in part reflecting the adoption of sfas no 123r and increased information systems implementation costs and other expenses 

 

operating profit in 2007 2006 and 2005 includes 79 million 47 million and 12 million respectively of costs and charges related to the company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives operating profit in 2007 2006 and 2005 includes 227 million 317 million and 43 million respectively of impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets operating profit in 2006 and 2005 includes 1 million and 6 million respectively of income regarding the behr litigation settlement operating profit margins as reported were 81 percent 90 percent and 127 percent in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively operating profit margins excluding the items above were 107 percent 118 percent and 131 percent in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

operating profit margins in 2007 were adversely affected by a continuing decline in new home construction and a moderation in consumer spending in north america both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of installation and other services assembled cabinets and windows and doors such sales volume declines negatively impacted operating profit margin by 16 percentage points compared to 2006 operating profit margins benefited from the company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending for certain “big ticket” home improvement items such as cabinets in the last half of 2006 both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of certain products and reduced operating profit margin by approximately one percent in 2006 compared to 2005 operating profit margins in 2006 were also affected by the continuing negative impact of higher commodity costs partially offset by certain selling price increases operating profit margins in 2005 were impacted by increased commodity energy and freight costs which had only been partially offset by selling price increases

interest expense was 258 million 240 million and 247 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in interest expense in 2007 is primarily due to increasing interest rates and the issuance of higher interest rate debt of 6125 notes in october 2006 and floatingrate notes and 585 notes in march 2007 these debt issuances were in consideration of the 2007 debt payments the decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily the result of the repayment of 800 million of 675 notes in march 2006 partially offset by the issuance of 1 billion of 6125 notes in october 2006 as well as the impact of increasing interest rates 

 

  

income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2007 were 397 million and 106 per common share respectively income from continuing operations for 2007 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of 227 million 208 million or 56 per common share after tax income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2006 were 478 million and 120 per common share respectively income from continuing operations for 2006 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 317 million 317 million or 79 per common share after tax income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2005 were 889 million and 207 per common share respectively income from continuing operations for 2005 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 43 million 43 million or 10 per common share after tax and income regarding the litigation settlement of 6 million pretax 4 million or 01 per common share after tax 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 44 percent 45 percent and 36 percent in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increased tax rates in 2007 and 2006 are primarily due to the impairment charges for goodwill not being deductible for tax purposes the company’s effective tax rate for income from continuing operations excluding the impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets was 36 percent 33 percent and 35 percent in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

the company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 42 to 43 percent in 2008 the expected tax rate for 2008 is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the us tax on anticipated dividend distributions from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are taxed at rates less than the us federal rate of 35 percent these dividends are being distributed to utilize certain favorable provisions of the us income tax law that are scheduled to expire at december 31 2008 the majority of the us tax currently payable on these dividends will be offset by the company’s 45 million foreign tax credit carryforward such utilization of the foreign tax credit carryforward will be accounted for as a reversal of the 45 million deferred tax asset 

outlook for the company 

 

economic conditions remain difficult in a number of the company’s markets housing starts declined 25 percent in 2007 due to excessive inventories of homes and less attractive mortgage terms as a result fullyear 2007 housing starts declined to 13 million from 21 million in 2005 and the company expects a further decline in housing starts in 2008 in addition the company anticipates a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products and notwithstanding recent actions by the federal reserve and the government to stimulate economic growth the company believes that 2008 will be a difficult year for the overall us economy in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company also experienced a softening of demand for certain of its international products due to declining european economies 

 

the company expects market conditions in its industry in the next several quarters to be very challenging the company is confident of its strategy of dividend increases and share repurchases while concentrating on organic growth improving returns and generating superior cash flow the company’s strategy together with the leveraging of the combined market strength of its retail service distribution and installation capabilities brands and scale should allow masco to continue to drive longterm growth and value for its shareholders

business rationalizations and other initiatives 

 

over the past several years the company has been focused on the rationalization of its businesses including sourcing programs business consolidations plant closures headcount reductions plant startups systems implementations and other initiatives for the year ended december 31 2007 the company incurred net costs and charges of 79 million related to these initiatives net of an 8 million gain from the sale of fixed assets 

 

during 2006 the company incurred 39 million pretax of costs and charges primarily accelerated depreciation and severance expense related to a plant closure and other profit improvement programs in the plumbing products segment in addition in 2006 the company incurred 8 million pretax of costs and charges including the writedown of inventories and accelerated depreciation related to the closure of a relatively small readytoassemble cabinet manufacturing facility in the cabinets and related products segment in 2005 the company also incurred approximately 12 million pretax of charges related to headcount reductions and the discontinuance of a product line in the plumbing products segment 

 

  

net sales of cabinets and related products decreased in 2007 primarily due to a decline in sales volume of assembled cabinets in the new home construction market which reduced sales in this segment by 11 percent compared to 2006 a decline in net sales of readytoassemble cabinets reduced sales in this segment by five percent in 2007 compared to 2006 a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in this segment and increased sales by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006 net sales in this segment decreased in 2006 primarily due to lower sales of readytoassemble cabinets in north america and europe which more than offset certain selling price increases and sales volume increases of assembled cabinets in north america in the first half of 2006 net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased sales volume in the new construction market as well as certain selling price increases 

 

operating profit margins in the cabinets and related products segment were negatively affected by the decline in sales volume in 2007 which reduced operating profit margin by three percentage points as well as increased startup costs and the underutilization of two new plants in this segment and increased severance costs such declines were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility of 8 million and benefits associated with business rationalizations and other initiatives in 2006 operating profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume in the last half of the year as well as increased commodity freight and plant startup costs and lower results of european operations offset in part by selling price increases in 2006 operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by 8 million of costs and charges related to the closure of a relatively small readytoassemble cabinet manufacturing facility operating profit margins in 2005 reflect increased commodity and freight costs and manufacturing and distribution inefficiencies in north america as well as a shift to a less favorable product mix which offset the positive impact of higher unit sales volume 

 

  

net sales of plumbing products increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of certain european operations which increased sales in this segment by three percent in 2007 compared to 2006 in 2007 increased selling prices also increased sales in this segment by three percent compared to 

2006 these results were partially offset by declining sales volume to north american retail and wholesale customers which reduced sales in this segment by four percent in 2007 compared to 2006 a weaker us dollar also had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in this segment and increased sales by four percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and increased sales by one percent in 2006 compared to 2005 net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased sales through the company’s wholesale distribution channel and the increased sales of certain european operations included in this segment 

 

operating profit margins in the plumbing products segment in 2007 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs in early 2007 which reduced operating profit margin by 17 percentage points compared to 2006 such declines were partially offset by selling price increases and the reduction of certain variable expenses operating profit margins in this segment were adversely affected by costs and charges aggregating 39 million and 12 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively related to certain profit improvement initiatives excluding such charges operating profit margins in this segment would have been 97 percent and 122 percent in 2006 and 2005 respectively in 2006 operating profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by increased commodity costs as well as a less favorable product mix and declining sales volume to certain retail customers operating profit margins in 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs which were not offset by selling price increases and a less favorable product mix which more than offset increased sales volume in the wholesale distribution channel 

 

the company’s plumbing products segment continues to be negatively impacted by import competition as well as a product mix shift towards lowermargin faucets within the north american retail channels as part of the company’s strategic review of its businesses the company determined that in order to remain competitive it is necessary to increase offshore sourcing at lower costs while consolidating and reducing manufacturing operations in north america consistent with this determination in 2006 the company closed a north american plant in this segment 

 

  

net sales of installation and other services decreased in 2007 primarily due to lower sales volume related to the continued slowdown in the new home construction market which reduced sales in this segment by 20 percent compared to 2006 and declines in selling prices partially offset by acquisitions which increased sales in this segment by six percent compared to 2006 net sales in this segment increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of noninsulation products and selling price increases in the first half of 2006 however the slowdown in the new home construction market significantly reduced sales in the second half of 2006 compared to 2005 net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased selling prices as well as increased sales volume of noninsulation products and strength in the new home construction market 

 

operating profit margins in the installation and other services segment were lower in 2007 primarily due to lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of fixed costs which decreased operating profit margin in this segment by approximately three percentage points compared to 2006 and lower selling prices the year 2007 also included increased bad debt expense increased severance and location closure costs and increased systems implementation expenses which on a combined basis reduced operating profit margin in this segment by one percentage point compared to 2006 partially offsetting these declines were reductions in material costs as well as benefits associated with the business rationalizations and other initiatives in 2006 the operating profit margin decline in this segment was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of generally lowermargin noninsulation products as well as increased operating costs to support the segment’s growth in noninsulation products new product development and technology initiatives operating profit margins in 2005 were affected by increases in sales of generally lowermargin noninsulation products as well as the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to material cost increases partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volume 

  

net sales of decorative architectural products increased in 2007 primarily due to higher retail sales volume from new product introductions of paints and stains which increased sales in this segment by four percent compared to 2006 which was partially offset by sales declines related to builder’s hardware net sales in this segment increased in 2006 primarily due to selling price increases of paints and stains net sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to increased sales volume of paints and stains 

 

operating profit margins in the decorative architectural products segment in 2007 primarily reflect increased sales volume of paints and stains offset by increased advertising expenses in 2006 operating profit margins in this segment improved due to increased selling prices of paints and stains which partially offset commodity cost increases experienced in late 2004 and during 2005 operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were impacted by increased material and freight costs which were not completely offset by increased selling prices related to paints and stains 

 

  

net sales of other specialty products decreased principally due to lower sales volume of windows and doors primarily resulting from the continued slowdown in the new home construction market particularly in the western united states which decreased sales in this segment by 14 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and four percent in 2006 compared to 2005 a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in this segment and increased sales by two percent in 2007 compared to 2006 net sales in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased sales volume and certain selling price increases of windows and doors to the north american new home construction market partially offset by reduced sales of european operations included in this segment 

 

operating profit margins in the other specialty products segment declined in 2007 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors in the new home construction market which decreased operating profit margin by 32 percentage points compared to 2006 and lower results of european operations which reduced operating profit by 16 percentage points compared to 2006 operating profit margins in this segment declined in 2006 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors which offset improved european operating results operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs and the lower results of european operations reflecting charges related to profit improvement initiatives offset in part by reduced state use tax expense 

 

geographic area results discussion 

 

  

net sales from north american operations decreased in 2007 primarily due to the continued decline in the new home construction market which declined 25 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 and a decline in consumer spending for home improvement products north american sales in 2007 were negatively affected by lower sales volume of installation and other services assembled cabinets and windows and doors in the new home construction market which decreased sales from north american operations by 11 percent compared to 2006 in addition north american net sales were negatively affected by lower retail sales volume of certain products partially offset by increased retail sales volume of paint and stains which aggregated a net decrease to sales from north american operations of one percent in 2007 compared to 2006 net sales from north american operations increased slightly in 2006 benefiting from relatively stronger market conditions in the first half of 2006 as well as increased selling prices an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending reduced sales volume in the second half of 2006 particularly for assembled cabinets windows and doors and sales of insulation products net sales from north american operations in 2005 were affected by the strength in the new home construction market and increased sales volume of cabinets installation sales of insulation and noninsulation products and sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors as well as increased selling prices for certain products 

in north america the company manufactures products principally windows doors and cabinets and provides installation of insulation and other services to homebuilders the company has relationships with 90 of the top 100 builders in the united states the company has seen an increase in bad debt expense related to homebuilders from 7 million in 2006 to 22 million in 2007 the company monitors its customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis currently the top ten us homebuilders represent less than three percent of the company’s consolidated receivable balance of 14 billion 

 

the decline in operating profit margin from north american operations in 2007 is primarily due to declines in new home construction and consumer spending which negatively impacted the sales volume of certain products and decreased operating profit margin by two percentage points compared to 2006 the declines in 2007 were partially offset by selling price increases and the benefits associated with the company’s business rationalizations and other initiatives in 2006 the operating profit margins declined from north american operations due to sales volume declines in the second half of 2006 of readytoassemble cabinets windows and doors and the installation of insulation products operating profit margins in 2006 were also negatively affected by increased commodity costs partially offset by selling price increases operating profit margins in 2005 were impacted by continued increases in commodity energy freight and other petroleumbased product costs which were only partially offset by selling price increases and increased sales volume of cabinets installation services and windows and patio doors to the new home construction market 

 

  

net sales from international operations increased in 2007 primarily due to increased sales volume of plumbing products which increased sales from international operations in local currencies by five percent compared to 2006 a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the translation of international results in 2007 increasing international net sales by ten percent compared to 2006 net sales from international operations increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales of plumbing products which increased sales from international operations in local currencies by six percent compared to 2005 a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the translation of european results increasing european net sales by one percent in 2006 compared to 2005 net sales from international operations in 2005 were affected by the increased local currency sales of exported plumbing products and readytoassemble cabinets offset in part by declining sales of windows and other plumbing products 

 

operating profit margins in 2007 were negatively affected by a less favorable product mix and material cost increases operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the lower operating results for european readytoassemble cabinets which more than offset the positive effect of increased sales volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of other european operations operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs and costs associated with certain profit improvement initiatives as well as a less favorable product mix

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect our company these risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute “forwardlooking statements” under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the impact on our company of certain of these risk factors is discussed below under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our company should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events these developments could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the following which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 

 

a significant portion of our business relies on residential construction activity 

 

our results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity including repair remodeling and new home construction principally in north america and europe significant factors that impact demand for home improvement and residential construction include interest rates energy costs consumer confidence general and regional economic conditions weather conditions and natural disasters the ability of contractors and builders to supply construction projects and the timing of such projects and thereby their purchases of our products and services can be affected significantly by the availability of building materials and skilled labor demographic factors such as changes in population growth and household formation affect levels of home improvement and residential construction over the longer term we have increased our emphasis on new product development in recent years and we have reduced our prior focus on growth through acquisitions and are concentrating instead on organic growth consequently our financial performance will in part reflect our success in implementing our growth strategies in our existing markets and in introducing new products or entering new geographic markets see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under item 7 of this report for discussion of the impact of residential construction activities on the company’s operating results 

 

we rely on key customers 

 

the size and importance of individual customers has increased because customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated larger customers can effect significant changes in their volume 

of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which we do business these customers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise as some of our customers expand their markets and targeted customers conflicts occur and in some instances we may also become their competitor sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial in 2006 sales to the company’s largest customer the home depot were 25 billion approximately 20 percent of net sales although builders dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the company’s products the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot would have a material adverse impact on the company 

 

we face significant competition in the us and global markets 

 

the major markets for our products and services are highly competitive and in recent years global competition has increased significantly competition in home improvement and building product lines is based largely on performance quality brand reputation style delivery customer service exclusivity and price competition in the markets for our service businesses is based primarily on price customer service scope of capabilities installation quality and financial strength although the relative importance of such factors varies between customers and among product categories price is often a primary factor home center retailers which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors may in the future intensify their marketing efforts directly to professional homebuilders our ability to maintain our leadership positions in the markets we serve and to grow the businesses depends to a large extent upon our success in maintaining our relationships with major customers managing our cost structure and introducing new products that appeal to changing consumer preferences 

 

our operating results are affected by the cost and availability of labor and materials 

 

when we incur cost increases for raw materials such as copper brass and particle board and for energy and other commodities it may be difficult for us to completely offset the impact with price increases on a timely basis due to outstanding commitments to customers competitive considerations and our customers’ resistance to accepting such price increases some of our operations including the installation and other services segment encounter shortages or unusual price increases in raw materials including insulation from time to time a substantial decrease in the availability of raw materials from suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our results of operations 

 

although the availability of qualified employees is important throughout the entire company this is particularly applicable to our installation and other services segment because of its laborintensive installation business significant changes in federal state and local regulations addressing immigration and wages as well as collective bargaining arrangements affecting wages and working conditions could adversely affect the performance of our businesses 

 

international developments have an increasing impact on our business 

 

over 17 percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds our international business faces risks associated with changes in political monetary economic and social environments local labor conditions and practices the laws regulations and policies of foreign governments cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights us laws affecting activities of us companies abroad including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices also impact our international business our international operating results have been adversely influenced in the past when compared to our north american results in part due to relative softness in the european markets and competitive pricing pressures on certain products 

 

increasingly we are sourcing products from outside north america principally in asia and selling products in international markets differing international business practices shipping and delivery requirements and laws and regulations applicable to our business in these markets have raised the 

complexity of managing our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 

 

our operating results can fluctuate based on changes in currency exchange rates which presents difficulty in comparing operating performance from period to period 

 

we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 

 

we have maintained investments in marketable securities and a number of private equity funds since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation in addition we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 

 

product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 

 

increasingly homebuilders including our customers are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business our contractual commitments to these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install 

 

we are also subject to product safety regulations recalls and direct claims for product liability including putative class actions product liability claims can result in significant liability and regardless of the ultimate outcome can be costly to defend also we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products we sell because we do not have direct control over the quality of such products we are exposed to the risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers

the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered the company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment such amounts are recorded in receivables the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions and other volumebased incentives allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 

 

  

inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an ongoing basis the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

 

  

the company has maintained investments in marketable securities and a number of private equity funds which aggregated 72 million and 211 million respectively at december 31 2006 investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized net of tax effect through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary 

 

the company’s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for potential impairment when impairment indicators are present or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse affect on the fair value of the investment impairment indicators the company considers include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance asset quality or business prospects a significant adverse change in the regulatory economic or technological environment a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates and any bona fide offers to purchase for less than the carrying value since there is no active trading market for these investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 

 

in november 2000 the company reduced its common equity ownership in metaldyne corporation “metaldyne” formerly mascotech inc through a recapitalization merger with an affiliate of heartland industrial partners lp “heartland” a private equity fund in which the company had a remaining investment of 17 million at december 31 2006 representing less than five percent of the fund the company in that transaction retained six percent of the common equity of metaldyne at december 31 2006 the company also held preferred stock of metaldyne which accrues dividends at the annual rate of 15 percent additionally the company owned an approximate 10 percent investment in trimas corporation “trimas” common stock investments in metaldyne and trimas are accounted for on the cost basis 

 

during 2006 based upon a review of new information from the heartland fund concerning fund investments and the continued deterioration of conditions in the automotive supplier and transportation products markets served by metaldyne and trimas the company determined that the decline in the estimated value of certain of its financial investments was otherthantemporary accordingly in the 

second quarter of 2006 the company recognized a noncash pretax impairment charge aggregating 78 million for its investments in metaldyne 40 million trimas 6 million the heartland fund 29 million and another fund 3 million which invested in automotive and transportationrelated suppliers including metaldyne and trimas additionally based upon the company’s review the company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of its other private equity fund investments and other investments to be otherthantemporary and accordingly recognized impairment charges of 13 million and 15 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2006 the company received new information related to its trimas investment and determined that the additional decline in the estimated value for this investment was otherthantemporary accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2006 the company recognized an additional noncash pretax impairment charge of 10 million related to its investment in trimas 

 

on january 11 2007 the acquisition of metaldyne by asahi tec corporation a japanese automotive supplier was finalized the combined fair value of asahi tec common and preferred stock received in exchange for the company’s investment in metaldyne common and preferred stock approximates 74 million and the company’s carrying value of the metaldyne investment was 57 million at december 31 2006 as a result a gain of approximately 17 million will be recognized in the first quarter of 2007 any unrealized gains or losses subsequent to january 11 2007 will be recognized net of tax through shareholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income in the company’s consolidated balance sheet beginning in the first quarter of 2007 

 

  

the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the fourth quarter of each year or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying amount the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates the company’s judgments are based upon historical experience current market trends consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome in estimating future cash flows the company relies on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast the company generally develops these forecasts based upon among other things recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting business units were greater than the carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 

 

if the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its fair value the company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit including any previously unrecognized intangible assets the excess of the fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting business unit’s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill this test for 2006 indicated that goodwill principally related to certain european business units was impaired 

 

the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 331 million 331 million after tax in 2006 the pretax impairment charges recorded in 2006 were as follows cabinets and related products – 316 million plumbing products – 1 million and decorative architectural products – 14 million these charges principally related to the company’s european manufacturer of readytoassemble cabinets tvilumscanbirk reflect the longterm outlook for that business unit including declining demand for certain products as well as decreased operating profit margins 

 

the impairment charge for goodwill related to tvilumscanbirk resulted from two significant changes impacting the business unit throughout the year but particularly in the fourth quarter of 2006 first there was a fundamental shift in the european readytoassemble raw materials supply market the change affected the cost structure for raw materials second the company determined that the business unit’s ability to increase selling prices and maintain revenue growth into the future has become more limited in the fourth quarter of 2006 as part of the annual goodwill impairment testing the company determined that these changes and the impact on operating profit and operating profit margins were permanent in nature 

 

the company reviews its other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit the company considers the implications of both external eg market growth competition and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales profit margins and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and longterm 

 

intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 

 

  

accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future based upon vested years of service and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses the company considers current market conditions including changes in interest rates in selecting these assumptions changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the company’s consolidated financial statements in any given period 

 

in 2006 the company increased its discount rate for obligations to an average of 550 percent from 525 percent the discount rate for obligations was based on the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plan’s liabilities matched to the december 31 2006 citigroup pension discount curve such rates for the company’s definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 400 percent to 600 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of 550 percent or higher the assumed asset return was primarily 850 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan assets 

 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas no 158” among other things sfas no 158 requires companies to prospectively recognize a net liability or asset and to report the funded status of their definedbenefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income such recognition did not affect the company’s consolidated statements of income the adoption of sfas no 158 was effective for the year ended december 31 2006 and the effect was included in the company’s consolidated balance sheet 

 

the company’s underfunded amount for its qualified definedbenefit pension plans the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 186 million at december 31 2006 from 231 million at december 31 2005 primarily due to asset returns above projections in accordance with sfas no 158 the 2006 unfunded amount has been recognized on the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2006 qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2006 had a net return of approximately 11 percent equal to average returns of 11 percent for the largest 1000 plan benchmark

the company expects pension expense for its qualified definedbenefit pension plans to decrease by 9 million in 2007 compared with 2006 if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower than the assumed asset return the 2007 pension expense would only decrease by 6 million the company expects pension expense for its nonqualified definedbenefit pension plans to decrease by 1 million in 2007 compared with 2006

the company’s gross profit margins were 275 percent 285 percent and 309 percent in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in the 2006 and 2005 gross profit margins reflects additional increased commodity energy and freight costs as well as a less favorable product mix offset in part by increased selling prices for certain products the 2004 gross profit margins reflected increased sales volume and increased selling prices offset in part by initial increases in commodity costs as well as sales in segments with somewhat lower gross margins

operating profit in 2006 and 2005 includes 47 million and 12 million respectively of costs and charges related to the company’s profit improvement programs principally in the plumbing products segment operating profit in 2006 2005 and 2004 includes 331 million 69 million and 112 million respectively of impairment charges for goodwill operating profit in 2006 2005 and 2004 includes 1 million 6 million and 30 million respectively of income regarding the behr litigation settlement operating profit margins as reported were 88 percent 125 percent and 134 percent in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively operating profit margins excluding the items above were 118 percent 131 percent and 141 percent in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending for certain “big ticket” home improvement items such as cabinets in the last half of 2006 both of which negatively impacted the sales volume of certain products as well as the continuing negative impact of higher commodity costs these items were partially offset by certain selling price increases operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased commodity energy freight and other petroleumbased product costs which had only been partially offset by selling price increases operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increased sales volume partially offset by increased commodity costs 

 

  

during 2006 the company recognized noncash pretax impairment charges aggregating 88 million for its investments related to metaldyne 40 million trimas 16 million the heartland fund 

29 million and another fund 3 million which invested in automotive and transportationrelated suppliers including metaldyne and trimas additionally during 2006 based upon the company’s review the company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of its other private equity fund investments and other investments to be otherthantemporary and accordingly recognized impairment charges of 13 million

interest expense was 240 million 247 million and 217 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily the result of the repayment of 800 million of 675 notes in march 2006 partially offset by the issuance of 1 billion of 6125 notes in october 2006 as well as the impact of increasing interest rates the increase in interest expense in 2005 is primarily due to the issuance of fixedrate notes in june 2005 as well as the impact of increasing interest rates 

 

  

income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2006 were 461 million and 115 per common share respectively income from continuing operations for 2006 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 331 million 331 million or 83 per common share after tax income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2005 were 866 million and 201 per common share respectively income from continuing operations for 2005 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 69 million 69 million or 16 per common share after tax and income regarding the litigation settlement of 6 million pretax 4 million or 01 per common share after tax income and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for 2004 were 944 million and 207 per common share respectively income from continuing operations for 2004 included noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill of 112 million 104 million or 23 per common share after tax and income regarding the litigation settlement of 30 million pretax 19 million or 04 per common share after tax 

 

the company’s effective tax rate for income from continuing operations was 46 percent in 2006 and 37 percent in both 2005 and 2004 the increased effective tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to an increase in impairment charges for goodwill not being deductible for tax purposes the company estimates that its effective tax rate should approximate 35 to 36 percent for 2007 

 

outlook for the company 

 

the company’s 2006 results were adversely affected by an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending for certain “big ticket” home improvement items such as cabinets and the continuing negative impact of higher commodity costs partially offset by profit improvement programs and selling price increases 

 

new home construction has declined dramatically in the last 12 months due to previous excessive speculative buying rapidly rising home prices in recent years reducing the affordability and less attractive mortgage terms housing starts declined by 13 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 to approximately 18 million units late in 2006 housing starts declined even further to an annual run rate of approximately 15 million to 16 million units which is more than 20 percent below the 2005 levels even with the recent decline in singlefamily housing starts the inventory of unsold new homes has increased to unprecedented levels 

 

the company is proactively managing its business for the current difficult economic times in our markets by pursuing a variety of initiatives to further reduce costs and improve operating profits initiatives already started include headcount reductions sourcing programs restructuring of certain businesses including consolidations manufacturing rationalization and other profit improvement programs while the company’s earnings outlook for 2007 incudes costs related to these initiatives as well as startup costs related to plant capacity additions system implementation costs higher interest expense and as yet unrecovered commodity cost increases the company believes that implementing these initiatives should improve the company’s earnings outlook for 2008 and beyond 

 

the company remains committed to its longterm growth strategy concentrating on organic sales growth improving return on invested capital and generating significant returns to shareholders we continue to drive our growth initiatives including leveraging installation services developing new channels of distribution pursuing new markets in emerging economies and emphasizing new product development

business segment results discussion 

 

changes in operating profit margins in the following business segment and geographic area results discussion exclude general corporate expense net gains on sale of corporate fixed assets net income regarding the litigation settlement and impairment charges for goodwill in 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

  

as part of its profit improvement programs the company has been focused on the rationalization of its plumbing products segment as a result in 2005 the company incurred approximately 12 million pretax of charges related to headcount reductions and the discontinuance of a product line in addition the company announced a plant closure in the plumbing products segment in january 2006 during 2006 the company incurred 39 million pretax of costs and charges primarily accelerated depreciation and severance expense related to this plant closure and other profit improvement programs in the plumbing products segment 

 

the company originally estimated that costs and charges for profit improvement programs related to its plumbing products segment would approximate 70 million pretax compared with the actual charges of 39 million pretax the reduced amount reflects the fourth quarter sale of a manufacturing facility in the plumbing products segment which was originally planned for closure 

 

in addition in 2006 the company incurred 8 million pretax of costs and charges including the writedown of inventories and accelerated depreciation related to the closure of a relatively small readytoassemble cabinet manufacturing facility in the cabinets and related products segment 

 

  

net sales of cabinets and related products decreased in 2006 primarily due to lower sales of readytoassemble cabinets in north american and europe which more than offset certain selling price increases and sales volume increases of assembled cabinets in north america in the first half of 2006 a weaker us dollar in 2006 also had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in this segment the 2005 sales increases in this segment were primarily attributable to increased sales volume in the new construction market as well as certain selling price increases 

 

the operating profit margins in this segment include the negative effect of 8 million of costs and charges related to the closure of a relatively small readytoassemble cabinet manufacturing facility in 2006 excluding such charges the operating profit margin was 136 percent in 2006 operating profit margins in this segment were negatively affected by a decline in sales volume in the last half of 2006 as well as increased commodity freight and plant startup costs offset in part by selling price increases operating profit margins in this segment were also negatively affected by lower european operating results particularly due to lower sales volume of readytoassemble cabinets and increased commodity costs operating profit margins in 2005 reflect increased commodity and freight costs and manufacturing and distribution inefficiencies in north america as well as a shift to a less favorable product mix which offset the positive impact of higher unit sales volume operating profit margins in 2004 reflect the positive impact of higher unit sales volume as well as certain profit improvement initiatives 

 

  

net sales of plumbing products increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of certain european operations as well as increased sales volume through the company’s north american wholesale distribution channel these results were offset in part by declining sales volume to certain retail customers a weaker us dollar in 2006 also had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in this segment net sales of plumbing products increased in 2005 principally due to increased sales through the company’s wholesale distribution channel and the increased sales of certain european operations included in this segment 

 

the operating profit margins in this segment were adversely affected by costs and charges aggregating 39 million and 12 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively related to certain profit improvement initiatives excluding such charges operating profit margins in this segment would have been 97 percent and 122 percent in 2006 and 2005 respectively operating profit margins in this segment in 2006 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs as well as a less favorable product mix and declining sales volume to certain retail customers the operating profit margins in 2005 were adversely affected by increased commodity costs which were not offset by selling price increases and a less favorable product mix which more than offset increased sales volume in the wholesale distribution channel the operating profit margins in 2004 reflect an increase in european sales as well as increased material costs and an increase in sales volume 

 

the company’s plumbing products segment continues to be negatively impacted by import competition as well as a product mix shift towards lowermargin faucets within the north american retail channels as part of the company’s strategic review of its businesses the company determined that in order to remain competitive it is necessary to increase offshore sourcing at lower costs while consolidating and reducing manufacturing operations in north america consistent with this determination in january 2006 the company announced a north american plant closure in this segment costs associated with this plant closure are included in the profit improvement costs above 

 

  

net sales of installation and other services increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales volume of noninsulation products and selling price increases in the first half of 2006 however the continued slowdown in the new home construction market significantly reduced sales in the second half of 2006 compared with 2005 particularly in the fourth quarter net sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to increased selling prices as well as increased sales volume of noninsulation products and continued strength in the new home construction market 

 

the 2006 operating profit margin decline in this segment was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of generally lowermargin noninsulation products as well as increased operating costs to support the segment’s continued growth in noninsulation products new product development and technology initiatives the slight decline in operating profit margins in 2005 was primarily attributable to continued increases in sales of generally lowermargin noninsulation products as well as the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to material cost increases partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volume the decline in operating profit margins in 2004 reflect an increase in sales of noninsulation products 

 

while the company experienced constrained availability of fiberglass insulation through the first half of 2006 due to planned availability programs implemented by its vendors the continued slowdown in new residential construction has now resulted in fiberglass insulation becoming readily available to the company at the current time the company believes that it will be able to source adequate quantities of insulation materials to meet its needs during 2007 

 

  

net sales of decorative architectural products increased in 2006 primarily due to selling price increases of paints and stains net sales in this segment increased in 2005 primarily due to increased sales volume for paints and stains 

 

the operating profit margins in this segment improved in 2006 due to increased selling prices of paints and stains which partially offset commodity cost increases experienced in late 2004 and during 2005 the operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased material and freight costs which were not completely offset by increased selling prices related to paints and stains the operating profit margins in 2004 include the effect of increased sales volume of paints and stains and increased sales volume and improved operating performance of the company’s decorative hardware businesses offset in part by increased material and promotion costs 

 

  

net sales of other specialty products decreased in 2006 principally due to lower sales volume of windows and doors resulting from a slowdown in the new home construction market particularly in the western united states a weaker us dollar in 2006 had a positive effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in this segment net sales of other specialty products increased in 2005 principally due to increased sales volume and certain selling price increases of doors and windows to the north american new home construction markets which were partially offset by reduced sales of european operations included in this segment 

 

the operating profit margins in this segment declined in 2006 due to lower sales volume of windows and doors which offset improved european operating results operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs and the lower results of european operations reflecting charges related to profit improvement initiatives offset in part by reduced state use tax expense the operating profit margins in 2004 were primarily attributable to increased sales volume of windows 

 

geographic area results discussion 

 

  

net sales from north american operations increased slightly in 2006 benefiting from relatively stronger market conditions in the first half of 2006 as well as increased selling prices an accelerating decline in the new home construction market and a moderation in consumer spending reduced sales volume in the second half of 2006 particularly for assembled cabinets windows and doors and sales of insulation products net sales from north american operations increased in 2005 primarily due to strength in the new home construction market and increased sales volume of cabinets installation sales of insulation and noninsulation products and sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors as well as increased selling prices for certain products 

 

operating profit margins include charges related to the company’s profit improvement programs principally in the plumbing products segment of 45 million and 12 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively excluding such charges operating profit margins from north american operations were 140 percent and 151 percent in 2006 and 2005 respectively the operating profit margin decline in north american operations is primarily due to sales volume declines in the second half of 2006 of readytoassemble cabinets windows and doors and the installation of insulation products as well as increased commodity costs partially offset by selling price increases operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by continued increases in commodity energy freight and other petroleumbased product costs which were only partially offset by selling price increases and increased sales volume of cabinets installation services and windows and patio doors to the new home construction market operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of assembled cabinets faucets paints and stains vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors and installed sales of insulation and noninsulation products operating profit margins in 2004 were negatively impacted by increased commodity costs which offset lower sales promotion costs 

 

  

net sales from international operations increased in 2006 primarily due to increased sales of plumbing products which more than offset lower sales volume of readytoassemble cabinets a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the translation of european results in 2006 increasing european net sales in 2006 by one percent net sales from international operations increased in 2005 primarily due to increased local currency sales of exported plumbing products and readytoassemble cabinets offset in part by declining sales of windows and other plumbing products 

 

operating profit margins in 2006 were negatively affected by the lower operating results for european readytoassemble cabinets which more than offset the positive effect of increased sales 

volume of plumbing products and improved operating results of other european operations operating profit margins in 2005 were negatively affected by increased commodity costs and costs associated with certain profit improvement initiatives as well as a less favorable product mix operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of plumbing products readytoassemble cabinets and windows 

 

other matters 

 

  

  

information regarding legal proceedings involving the company is set forth in note t to the consolidated financial statements

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 108 “quantifying financial statement misstatements” “sab 108” historically the company evaluated financial statement misstatements using an “ironcurtain” method which primarily focused on the effect of correcting the periodend balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prioryear errors on the statement of income sab 108 clarified that the evaluation of financial statement misstatements must be made based upon all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors this is referred to as a “dual approach” sab 108 is effective for the year ended december 31 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not have an effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the adoption of sfas no 157 is effective january 1 2008 the company is currently evaluating the impact that the provisions of sfas no 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement 109” “fin no 48” fin no 48 allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities fin no 48 also provides guidance on classification interest and 

penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the adoption of fin no 48 is effective january 1 2007 

 

historically the company has established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” “sfas no 5” under this standard reserves for tax contingencies are established when it is probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated fin no 48 establishes a lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions than the thresholds under sfas no 5 therefore although the company has not completed its evaluation of the impact of fin no 48 on its consolidated financial statements it currently estimates that its reserves for income tax contingencies net of any federal tax benefit will increase by approximately 25 million to 45 million as of the date of adoption the cumulative effect of applying fin no 48 will be recorded as a reduction to beginning retained earnings in 2007 the company believes that in future years there will be a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment to affect the tax reserve computation to a greater degree than sfas no 5 

 

in addition the company expects to reclassify the majority of its reserves for income tax contingencies from current to noncurrent liabilities in accordance with the provisions of fin no 48

at december 31 2006 the company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of 200 basis points in average interest rates a 10 percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a 10 percent decline in the market value of the company’s longterm investments based upon the analyses performed such changes would not be expected to materially affect the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

item 1a risk factors

     there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect our
operations these risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ
from past performance or expected results including results described in
statements elsewhere in this report that constitute forwardlooking statements
under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the impact on our
operations of certain of these risk factors is discussed below under item 7
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or
that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our
business should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events these
developments could have material adverse effects on our business financial
condition and results of operations these risks and uncertainties include but
are not limited to the following which we consider to be most relevant to our
specific business activities

a significant portion of our business relies on residential construction
activity

     our results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and
residential construction activity principally in north america and europe
including repair and remodeling and new construction interest rates energy
costs consumer confidence general and regional economic conditions and
weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home
improvement and residential construction activity historically the company has
largely offset the impact on its reve

nues of cyclical declines in the new construction and home improvement markets
through new product introductions acquisitions and market share gains we have
increased our emphasis on new product development in recent years but we have
reduced our prior focus on growth through acquisitions in favor of organic
growth consequently our financial performance will in part reflect our
success in implementing our growth strategies in our existing markets and in
introducing new products or entering new geographic markets

we rely on our key customers

     the size and importance of individual customers has increased because
customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated larger customers
can effect significant changes in their volume of purchases and can otherwise
significantly affect the terms and conditions on which we do business further
as these same customers expand their markets and targeted customers conflicts
occur and in some instances we also become their competitors our relationships
with home centers are particularly important because sales of our home
improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial in
2005 sales to the companys largest customer the home depot were 27 billion
approximately 21 percent of total sales although builders dealers and other
retailers represent other channels of distribution for the companys products
the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot would have a
material adverse impact on the company

we face significant competition in the us and global markets

     the major markets for our products and services are highly competitive and
in recent years global competition has increased significantly competition in
our home improvement and building product lines is based largely on performance
quality brand reputation style delivery customer service exclusivity and
price competition in the markets for our service businesses is based primarily
on price customer service scope of capabilities installation quality and
financial strength although the relative importance of such factors varies
between customers and among product categories price is often a primary factor
our ability to maintain our leadership positions in our markets and to grow our
businesses depends to a large extent upon our success in maintaining our
relationships with our major customers managing our cost structure and
introducing new products

our operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw material

     when we incur cost increases for raw materials energy and other
commodities it may be difficult for us to completely offset the impact with
price increases on a timely basis due to outstanding commitments to our
customers competitive considerations and our customers resistance to accepting
such price increases some of our operations including the installation and
other services segment encounter shortages or unusual price increases in raw
materials from time to time a substantial decrease in the availability of
products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could
adversely impact our results of operations

our international business has different risks from those of our north american
business

     over 15 percent of our sales are derived outside of north america
principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars
principally euros and great britain pounds our international business faces
political monetary economic and other risks that vary from country to country
our international operating results have been adversely influenced in recent
years in part due to softness in the european markets and competitive pricing
pressures on certain products our operating results can fluctuate based on
changes in us dollar exchange rates which also presents difficulty in
comparing operating performance from period to period

                                        7

we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets including
assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk

     we maintain investments in a number of private equity funds and in
marketable securities since there is no active trading market for investments
in private equity funds they are for the most part illiquid these investments
by their nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk
including financial leverage than other financial investments future changes
in market conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or
new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the
recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation
in addition we have commitments that require us when requested to contribute
additional capital to these private equity funds

product liability claims and other litigation could be costly

     increasingly homebuilders including our customers are subject to
construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their
business our contractual commitments to these customers typically include our
agreement to indemnify them for liability for the performance of our products or
services or the performance of other products that we install we are also
subject to product safety recalls and direct claims for product liability
including putative class actions which can result in significant liability and
be costly to defend see note u to the consolidated financial statements
included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation
involving our businesses

consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this
financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes

     the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain
statements reflecting the companys views about its future performance and
constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 these views involve risks and uncertainties that are
difficult to predict and accordingly the companys actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements

1a risk factors of this report the executive level overview critical
accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections may
affect the companys performance the company undertakes no obligation to update
publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future
events or otherwise

executive level overview

     the company manufactures and installs home improvement and building
products these products are sold to the home improvement and home construction
markets through mass merchandisers hardware stores home centers builders
distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors

     factors that affect the companys results of operations include the levels
of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north
america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction the
importance of and the companys relationships with key customers including the
home depot which represented approximately 21 percent of the companys sales in
2005 the companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets
in the face of increasing global competition the companys ability to
effectively manage its overall cost structure and the availability and cost of
raw materials the companys international business faces political monetary
economic and other risks that vary from country to country as well as
fluctuations in european currency exchange rates further the company has
financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily
marketable and that involve financial risk in addition product liability
claims and other litigation could be costly these factors are discussed in more
detail in item 1a risk factors of this report historically the company has
largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in the new
construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions
acquisitions and market share gains while acquisitions have enabled the company
to build the critical mass that has given the company strong positions in the
markets it serves the company has put less emphasis on growth through
acquisitions to focus on organic sales growth

critical accounting policies and estimates

     the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions
which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may
differ from these estimates and assumptions

     the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are
affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements
                                        12
page

     revenue recognition and receivables

     the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is
transferred to customers or when services are rendered the company records
estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings
including special pricing and cooperative advertising arrangements promotions
and other volumebased incentives allowances for doubtful accounts receivable
are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to
make required payments

     inventories

     inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with
expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the
difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market
value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions on an
ongoing basis the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for
differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual
results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these
estimates

     financial investments

     the company maintains investments in marketable securities which
aggregated 115 million and a number of private equity funds which aggregated
262 million at december 31 2005 the investments in private equity funds are
carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period or
when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist using information made
available by the fund managers and other assumptions the investments in
marketable securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and
unrealized losses that are deemed to be temporary are recorded as a component
of shareholders equity net of tax effect in other comprehensive income the
company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has
experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary future
changes in market conditions the performance of underlying investments or new
information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded
values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation

     based on its review in the third quarter of 2005 the company recognized
an impairment charge of 28 million related to its investment in four million
shares of furniture brands international nysefbn common stock to reduce the
cost basis from 2505 per share to the market value at september 30 2005 of
1803 per share in 2004 the company also recognized an impairment charge of
21 million related to the companys investment in fbn at december 31 2005
the fbn common stock was in an unrealized gain position the aggregate carrying
value of the investment was 90 million the fbn common stock included in
marketable securities was received in june 2002 from the companys investment
in furnishings international inc debt

     the companys investments in private equity funds and other private
investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each
reporting period or when circumstances including the maturity of the fund
indicate impairment may exist since there is no active trading market for these
investments they are for the most part illiquid these investments by their
nature can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk including
financial leverage than other financial investments future changes in market
conditions the future performance of the underlying investments or new
information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded
values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation based on
the companys review of its private equity funds the company considered the
decline in the estimated market value of certain of its private equity fund
investments to be otherthantemporary and accordingly recognized an
impairment charge of 15 million in the third quarter of 2005 at december 31
2005 the carrying value of the companys investments in private equity funds
exceeded the estimated market value as determined by the fund managers by
approximately 19 million which the company considers to be a temporary decline
in the estimated fair value

     goodwill and other intangible assets

     the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net
tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable
intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth
quarter of each year or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill
utilizing a discounted cash flow method

     determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the
company to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm
projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates the
companys judgments are based on historical experience current market trends
consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation
methodology are reasonable different estimates and assumptions could result in
a different outcome in estimating future cash flows the company relies on
internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits
including capital expenditures and generally a one to three percent longterm
assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear
forecast the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales
data for existing products planned timing of new product launches estimated
housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes

     in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company estimated that future discounted
cash flows projected for most of its reporting units were greater than the
carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no
impact on the reported value of goodwill

     if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the
company measures the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of
the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets
and liabilities of the reporting unit including any previously unrecognized
intangible assets the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the
amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of
goodwill an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting units
recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill this test for 2005
indicated that goodwill related to certain european businesses was impaired the
company recognized a noncash pretax impairment charge of 69 million 69
million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2005

     the company reviews its individual indefinitelived intangible assets for
impairment annually and if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate
the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit the company
considers the implications of both external eg market growth competition
and local economic conditions and internal eg product sales profit margins
and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows
related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term

     intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their
estimated lives the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable
identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether
events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of
amortization

     employee retirement plans

     accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost
of benefits to be provided in the future based on vested years of service and
attributing those costs over the time period each employee works pension costs
and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations inherent
in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on
plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for
obligations the company considers current market conditions including changes
in interest rates in selecting these assumptions the company selects these
assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consul

                                        14

tants lawyers and actuaries changes in assumptions used could result in
changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the companys
consolidated financial statements in any given period

     in 2005 the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to an
average of 525 percent from 575 percent the discount rate for obligations was
based on the expected duration of each definedbenefit pension plans
liabilities matched to the december 31 2005 citigroup pension discount curve
such rates for the companys definedbenefit pension plans ranged from 400
percent to 575 percent with the most significant portion of the liabilities
having a discount rate for obligations of 525 percent or higher the assumed
asset return was primarily 850 percent reflecting the expected longterm
return on plan assets

     the companys underfunded amount or the difference between the projected
benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 231 million from 193 million
in 2004 primarily due to asset returns below projections qualified domestic
pension plan assets in 2005 had a net gain of approximately four percent
compared with average returns of five percent for the largest 1000 plan
benchmark

     the companys projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded
nonqualified supplemental definedbenefit pension plans was 143 million at
december 31 2005 compared with 125 million at december 31 2004

     the company expects pension expense for its qualified definedbenefit
pension plans to increase by 2 million in 2006 compared with 2005 if the
company assumed that the future return on plan assets was onehalf percent lower
than the assumed asset return the 2006 pension expense would increase by an
additional 2 million

     stock options and awards

     the companys 2005 long term stock incentive plan the 2005 plan
replaced the 1991 long term stock incentive plan the 1991 plan in may 2005
and provides for the issuance of stockbased incentives in various forms at
december 31 2005 outstanding stockbased incentives were in the form of
restricted longterm stock awards stock appreciation rights phantom stock
awards and stock options additionally the companys 1997 nonemployee
directors stock plan the 1997 plan provides for the payment of part of the
compensation to nonemployee directors in company common stock

     restricted longterm stock awards

     longterm stock awards are granted to key employees and nonemployee
directors of the company and do not cause net share dilution as the company
continues the practice of reacquiring an equal number of shares on the open
market the unvested stock awards aggregating 185 million 9 million common
shares at december 31 2005 are included as a reduction in shareholders equity
and are being expensed based on the respective vesting periods principally 10
years compensation expense for the annual vesting of longterm stock awards was
44 million for the year ended december 31 2005

     stock options

     fixed price stock options are granted to key employees and nonemployee
directors of the company the grant date exercise price equals the market price
of company common stock on the date of grant these options generally become
exercisable in installments beginning on the first anniversary from the date of
grant and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date restoration stock
options under the 1991 plan become exercisable six months from the date of
grant the 2005 plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options
except for restoration options resulting from the options granted under the 1991
plan

                                        15

     the company began using the fair value method of accounting for options
granted modified or settled subsequent to january 1 2003 and options granted
prior to january 1 2003 continue to be accounted for using the intrinsic value
method as of december 31 2005 effective january 1 2006 the company will
adopt sfas no 123r accounting for stockbased compensation using the
modified prospective application mpa method sfas no 123r requires
companies to measure and recognize the cost fair value of employee services
received in exchange for stock options the mpa method will require the company
to record expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to january
1 2003 through the remaining vesting periods the expense for unvested stock
options at january 1 2006 will be based on the grantdate fair value of those
awards as calculated for pro forma disclosure under sfas no 123 changes to the
grantdate fair value of stock options granted before january 1 2006 are
prohibited the mpa method does not require the restatement of prioryear
information the amount of expense related to total unvested stock options
remaining at december 31 2005 was 104 million such options have a weighted
average vesting period of over 3 years

     the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a
blackscholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2005
riskfree interest rate  41 dividend yield  23 volatility factor  358
and expected option life  7 years for sfas no 123r calculation purposes the
weighted average grantdate fair value of option shares including restoration
options granted in 2005 was 1033 per option share the fair value for each
option grant is calculated and the related expense is recorded over the vesting
period of the option grant

     if the company increased its assumptions for the riskfree interest rate
and the volatility factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value
of stock options granted in 2005 would increase 44 percent if the company
decreased its assumptions for the riskfree interest rate and the volatility
factor by 50 percent the expense related to the fair value of stock options
granted in 2005 would decrease 55 percent

     income taxes

     the company has considered potential sources of future foreign taxable
income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its
deferred tax assets at december 31 2005 and 2004 related to its aftertax
foreign tax credit carryforward of 50 million should the company determine
that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in
the future a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such
determination is made

     other commitments and contingencies

     certain of the companys products and product finishes and services are
covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for
periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the time of sale
the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide
products parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of
warranty obligations the companys estimate of costs to service its warranty
obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future
conditions to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty
claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty
liability is adjusted accordingly

     the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims
including income taxes with respect to matters generally arising in the
ordinary course of business liabilities and costs associated with these matters
require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and
experience of management and its legal counsel when estimates of the companys
exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for
recognition under sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies amounts are
recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to
the company may differ due to subsequent developments see note u to the
companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal
proceedings involving the company

liquidity and capital resources

     historically the company has largely funded its growth through cash
provided by a combination of its operations longterm bank debt and other
borrowings and by the issuance of company common stock including issuances for
certain mergers and acquisitions

     bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds at
december 31 2005 debt agreements with banks syndicated in the united states
relate to a 20 billion 5year revolving credit agreement which expires in
november 2009 this agreement allows for borrowings denominated in us dollars
or european euros interest is payable on borrowings under this agreement based
on various floatingrate options as selected by the company

     in february 2006 the company amended the terms of the 20 billion 5year
revolving credit agreement the amendment primarily affected the requirement for
the company to maintain certain levels of net worth

     the 5year revolving credit agreement as amended contains limitations on
additional borrowings at december 31 2005 the company had additional
borrowing capacity subject to availability of up to 25 billion the 5year

under the companys unallocated shelf registration statement with the securities
and exchange commission was 15 billion

percent to 20 per common share this marks the 47th consecutive year in which
dividends have been increased although the company is aware of the greater
interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend
payout in recent years the company continues to believe that its shareholders
longterm interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its
earnings in the future growth of the company

     maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the companys
financial strategies the companys total debt as a percent of total
capitalization increased to 49 percent at december 31 2005 from 44 percent at
december 31 2004 repurchases and retirement of company common stock
contributed to the increase in the total debt to total capitalization ratio the
companys working capital ratio was 18 to 1 and 21 to 1 at december 31 2005
and 2004 respectively the decline in the current ratio is primarily due to the
reclassification to current liabilities of 800 million of 675 notes that are
due and payable on march 15 2006 the company intends to use a portion of its
cash to retire the notes due march 2006

     the derivatives used by the company during the year ended december 31 2005
consist of interest rate swaps entered into in 2005 for the purpose of
effectively converting a portion of fixedrate debt to variablerate debt
generally under interest rate swap agreements the company agrees with a
counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate and variablerate
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount
the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions thereby
minimizing the risk of credit loss the interest rate swap agreements are
designated as fairvalue hedges and the interest rate differential on interest
rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to
interest expense over the term of the agreement

                                        18

for fairvalue hedge transactions changes in the fair value of the derivative
and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining
earnings

     the average variable interest rates are based on the london interbank
offered rate libor plus a fixed adjustment factor the average effective
rate on the interest rate swaps was 5519 at december 31 2005 the interest
rate swap agreements covered a notional amount of 850 million of the companys
fixedrate debt due july 15 2012 at an interest rate of 5875 the hedges are
considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the
derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item accordingly no
gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the companys
consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2005 and
2004 the amount recognized as a reduction of interest expense was 3 million
for the year ended december 31 2005

     certain of the companys european operations also entered into foreign
currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing exposure to currency
fluctuations primarily related to the united states dollar and the great
britain pound

price increases

continues to be focused on the simplification of its business model cash flow
generation improvement in return on invested capital and the return of cash to
shareholders through share repurchases and dividends

     consistent with this strategy the company is pursuing a variety of
initiatives to offset cost increases and increase operating profit including
sourcing programs the restructuring of certain of its businesses including
consolidations manufacturing rationalization headcount reductions and other
profit improvement programs while the company has incurred and will incur
additional expenses and charges related to these programs implementing these
initiatives should improve the companys earnings outlook for 2006 and beyond

closure in the plumbing products segment costs associated with this plant
closure and other profit improvement programs are currently expected to
approximate 70 million and are expected to be incurred during 2006

business segment results discussion

     changes in operating profit margins in the following business segment and
geographic area results discussion exclude general corporate expense the income
regarding the litigation settlement and the goodwill impairment charges in 2005
2004 and 2003

     cabinets and related products

     net sales of cabinets and related products increased eight percent in 2005
compared with 2004 and increased 14 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 the 2005
sales increases in this segment were primarily attributable to increased sales
volume in the new construction market as well as certain selling price
increases the sales increases in 2004 were primarily due to increased sales
volume of assembled cabinets largely through north american retail distribution
channels at major home centers and through the new construction market in the
united states as well as a more favorable product mix this segment was
favorably influenced by a weaker us dollar in 2004 which affected the
translation of local currencies of european operations included in this segment

     operating profit margins were 155 percent 169 percent and 151 percent
for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operating
profit margins in 2005 reflect increased commodity and freight costs as well as
a shift to a less favorable product mix which offset the positive impact of
higher unit sales volume operating profit margins in this segment were also
negatively affected by manufacturing and distribution inefficiencies due to
increased demand for assembled cabinets in north america the company has major
capital expansion programs to increase north american assembled cabinet
manufacturing capacity for both the retail and new construction markets these
new facilities located in the western us are expected to be in production in
early 2007 operating profit margins in 2004 reflect the positive impact of
higher unit sales volume as well as certain cost improvement initiatives

     plumbing products

     net sales of plumbing products increased four percent in 2005 compared with
2004 principally due to increased sales through the companys wholesale
distribution channel and the increased sales of certain european operations
included in this segment while sales volumes have increased such increases
were offset by a less favorable product mix and by continuing weakness impacting
certain products sold through retail markets net sales of plumbing products
increased 14 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to increased sales
volume in the retail markets in north america and europe and in the new
construction market in north america a weaker us dollar also had a favorable
impact on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in
this segment in 2004

     operating profit margins were 118 percent 129 percent and 134 percent
for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operating
profit margins in this segment in 2005 were adversely affected by charges
aggregating 12 million related to certain profit improvement initiatives
including severance costs and costs associated with exiting a product line the
operating profit margins in this segment in 2005 were also adversely affected by
increased commodity costs which have not been offset by selling price increases
and a less favorable product mix which more than offset increased sales volume
in the wholesale distribution channel the companys plumbing products segment
continues to be negatively impacted by import competition as well as a product
mix shift towards lowermargin faucets within the north american retail
channels as part of the companys strategic review of its businesses the
company determined that in order to remain competitive it is necessary to
increase offshore sourcing at lower costs while consolidating and reducing
manufacturing operations in north america consistent with this determination
in january 2006 the company announced a north american plant closure in this
segment the costs and expenses associated with this plant closure and other
profit improvement initiatives are expected to approximate 70 million and

                                        25
page

will be incurred during 2006 the company anticipates that this closure will
improve the outlook for its plumbingrelated business beyond 2006 operating
profit margins in 2004 compared with 2003 reflect an increase in european sales
which are generally at lower margins as well as increased material costs
offset in part by increased sales volume

     installation and other services

     net sales of installation and other services increased 11 percent in 2005
compared with 2004 and increased 15 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 the
increases in net sales in 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to increased selling
prices as well as increased sales volume of noninsulation products and
continued strength in the new construction market

     operating profit margins were 125 percent 129 percent and 153 percent
for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the slight
decline in the 2005 operating profit margin was primarily attributable to
continued increases in sales of generally lowermargin noninsulation products
as well as the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to
material cost increases partially offset by the favorable impact of higher
sales volume the 2004 operating profit margin decline was primarily
attributable to the time lag in implementing selling price increases related to
material cost increases as well as an increase in sales of generally
lowermargin noninsulation products

     within the installation and other services segment the availability of
fiberglass insulation to support the companys installation and distribution
activities continues to be constrained the high level of demand for fiberglass
insulation as a result of the continued strong new construction market has
outpaced the industrys capacity to produce additional product the company
believes that these conditions will persist at least through the first half of
2006 and is working with its diverse supplier base to secure the appropriate
amount of material at the current time the company believes that it will be
able to do so but if the company cannot obtain the required amount of material
this could have a negative impact on its operations

     decorative architectural products

     net sales of decorative architectural products increased four percent in
2005 compared with 2004 and increased 11 percent in 2004 compared with 2003 the
increase in net sales in 2005 was primarily due to increased selling prices for
paints and stains the increase in net sales in 2004 was primarily due to higher
unit sales volume of paints and stains as well as increased sales of decorative
hardware

     operating profit margins were 165 percent 206 percent and 148 percent
for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operating
profit margins for this segment in 2005 were negatively impacted by increased
material and freight costs which were not completely offset by increased
selling prices related to paints and stains the operating profit margin
improvement in 2004 includes the effect of increased sales volume of paints and
stains and increased sales volume and improved operating performance of the
companys decorative hardware businesses offset in part by increased material
and promotion costs

     operating profit margins for this segment in 2003 were impacted by
increased advertising and marketing costs including additional costs associated
with new instore paint display centers and fixed asset and inventory
adjustments reflecting excess obsolete and resourced products related to
decorative hardware operating profit margins for this segment in 2003 were
negatively affected by noncash pretax charges of 55 million related to a
business system implementation failure at a united kingdom business unit

     other specialty products

     net sales of other specialty products increased four percent in 2005
compared with 2004 principally due to increased sales volume and certain
selling price increases of vinyl and fiberglass windows

                                        26
page

and patio doors to north american new construction markets which were partially
offset by reduced sales of european operations included in this segment net
sales of other specialty products increased 17 percent in 2004 compared with
2003 principally due to increased sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows and
doors in north america a weaker us dollar in 2004 also had a favorable effect
on the translation of local currencies of european operations included in this
segment

     operating profit margins were 197 percent 192 percent and 182 percent
for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operating
profit margins in this segment in 2005 were negatively affected by increased
commodity costs and the lower results of european operations reflecting charges
related to profit improvement initiatives offset in part by reduced state use
tax expense the operating profit margin improvement in 2004 was primarily
attributable to increased sales volume of windows the operating profit margins
in 2003 reflect increased material and insurance costs as well as lower results
of european operations

geographic area results discussion

     north america

     net sales from north american operations increased eight percent in 2005
compared with 2004 and increased 13 percent in 2004 compared with 2003
primarily due to continued strength in the new construction market and increased
sales volume of cabinets installed sales of insulation and noninsulation
products and vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors as well as increased
selling prices for certain products

     operating profit margins were 150 percent 166 percent and 163 percent
for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operating
profit margins in 2005 were negatively impacted by continued increases in
commodity energy freight and other petroleumbased product costs which have
not been offset by selling price increases partially offset by increased sales
volume of cabinets installation services and windows and patio doors to the new
construction market operating profit margins in 2004 were positively affected
by increases in sales volume of assembled cabinets faucets paints and stains
vinyl and fiberglass windows and patio doors and installed sales of insulation
and noninsulation products operating profit margins in 2004 were negatively
impacted by increased commodity costs which offset lower sales promotion costs
the operating profit margins in 2003 reflect increased sales in segments that
have somewhat lower operating profit margins increased commodity and energy
costs as well as increased advertising and promotion costs

     international principally europe

     net sales of the companys international operations increased one percent
in 2005 compared with 2004 primarily due to increased local currency sales of
exported plumbing products and readytoassemble cabinets offset in part by
declining sales of windows and other plumbing products net sales of the
companys international operations increased 22 percent in 2004 compared with
2003 due to increased sales of plumbing products readytoassemble cabinets
and windows a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the translation of

     operating profit margins were 116 percent 116 percent and 85 percent
for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively operating
profit margins for 2005 were affected by increased commodity costs and costs
associated with certain profit improvement initiatives as well as a less
favorable product mix operating profit margins for 2004 were positively
affected by increases in sales volume of plumbing products readytoassemble
cabinets and windows operating profit margins for international operations for
2003 were adversely affected by the noncash pretax charges relating to
accounting irregularities discussed previously

modified prospective application mpa method the mpa method will require the
company to record expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to

million pretax in 2006 the company has been using the fair value method for
options granted modified or settled subsequent to january 1 2003 the company
is currently evaluating the impact that the other provisions of sfas no 123r
will have on its consolidated financial statements

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

     the financial and business analysis below provides information which the
company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the companys
consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this
financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes

     the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain
statements reflecting the companys views about its future performance and
constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 these views involve risks and uncertainties that are

                                        10
page

difficult to predict and accordingly the companys actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements
readers should consider that various factors including changes in general
economic conditions and competitive market conditions pricing pressures
relationships with key customers industry consolidation of retailers
wholesalers and builders shifts in distribution the influence of ecommerce
and other factors discussed in the executive level overview critical
accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections may
affect the companys performance the company undertakes no obligation to update
publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future
events or otherwise

executive level overview

     the company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home
improvement and building products these products are sold to the home
improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware
stores home centers builders distributors and other outlets for consumers and
contractors the company also supplies and installs insulation and other
building products for builders in the new residential construction market

     factors that affect the companys results of operations include the levels
of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north
america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction the
companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure fluctuations
in european currencies primarily the european euro and great britain pound
the importance of and the companys relationships with home centers including
the home depot which represented approximately 22 percent of the companys
sales in 2004 as distributors of home improvement and building products and the
companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the
face of increasing global competition historically the company has been able
to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in the new
construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and
acquisitions as well as market share gains

critical accounting policies and estimates

     the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods the company regularly reviews its estimates which are based
on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may
differ from these estimates and assumptions

     the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are
affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements

     receivables and inventories

     the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
and incentive offerings including special pricing arrangements promotions and
other volumebased incentives allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are
maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to
make required payments inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net
realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable
inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and
their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market
conditions on an ongoing basis the company monitors these estimates and
records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience

                                        11
page

historically actual results have not significantly deviated from those
determined using these estimates

     financial investments

     the company maintains investments in marketable securities which
aggregated 263 million and a number of private equity funds which aggregated
308 million at december 31 2004 the investments in private equity funds are
carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period or
when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist using information made
available by the fund managers and other assumptions the investments in
marketable equity securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and
unrealized losses that are deemed to be temporary are recorded as a component
of shareholders equity net of tax effect in other comprehensive income
loss the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment
has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be otherthantemporary
future changes in market conditions the performance of underlying investments
or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the
recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation

     in the fourth quarter of 2004 the company recognized an impairment charge
of 21 million related to the companys investment in furniture brands
international nyse fbn the fbn common stock was received in june 2002 from
the companys investment in furnishings international inc debt based on its
review the company considers the decline in market value related to this
investment to be otherthantemporary and recorded a pretax impairment charge
of 21 million to reduce the cost basis from 3025 per share to 2505 per
share at december 31 2004 the aggregate carrying value after the adjustment
was 100 million

     goodwill and other intangible assets

     the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net
tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable
intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets the company is no longer recording amortization expense
related to goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth
quarter of each year or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill and
other indefinitelived intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow
method this test for 2004 indicated that goodwill related to certain european
businesses was impaired the company recognized a noncash pretax impairment
charge of 168 million 141 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2004
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated
lives the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable
intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization

     determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the
company to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm
projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates the
companys judgments are based on historical experience current market trends
consultations with external valuation specialists and other information while
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation
methodology are reasonable different assumptions could result in a different
outcome in estimating future cash flows the company relies on internally
generated fiveyear forecasts for sales and operating profits including capital
expenditures and generally a three percent longterm assumed growth rate of cash
flows for periods after the fiveyear forecast the company generally develops
these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products planned timing
of new product launches housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for
existing homes

                                        12
page

     in the fourth quarter of 2004 the company estimated that future discounted
cash flows projected for most of its business units were greater than the
carrying values any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no
impact on the reported value of goodwill

     employee retirement plans

     accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost
of benefits to be provided in the future based on vested years of service and
attributing those costs over the time period each employee works pension costs
and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations inherent
in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on
plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for
obligations the company considers current market conditions including changes
in interest rates in selecting these assumptions the company selects these
assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants lawyers
and actuaries changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the
related pension costs and obligations within the companys consolidated
financial statements in any given period

     in 2004 the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to 575
percent from 625 percent which reflects the decline in longterm interest
rates the assumed asset return is 85 percent reflecting the expected
longterm return on plan assets

     the companys underfunded amount for the difference between the projected
benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 193 million from 217 million
in 2003 this is primarily the result of asset returns above projections and
company contributions qualified domestic pension plan assets in 2004 had a net
gain of approximately 12 percent as compared with average returns of 10 percent
for the largest 1000 plan benchmark

     the companys projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded
nonqualified supplemental definedbenefit pension plans was 125 million at
december 31 2004 compared with 115 million at december 31 2003

     the company expects pension expense for its qualified definedbenefit
pension plans in 2005 to approximate such expense in 2004 if the company
assumed that the future return on plan assets was 8 percent instead of 85
percent the pension expense for 2005 would increase by approximately 2
million

     income taxes

     the company has considered future income and gains from investments and
other identified taxplanning strategies including the potential sale of
certain operating assets and identified potential sources of future foreign
taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets at december 31 2004 particularly related to
its aftertax capital loss carryforward of 21 million and its aftertax foreign
tax credit carryforward of 50 million should the company determine that it
would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the
future a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination
is made

     changes to the us tax law enacted in the fourth quarter of 2004
significantly impacted the taxation of foreign earnings distributions as a
result the company made a dividend distribution of accumulated earnings from
certain of its foreign subsidiaries of approximately 500 million in the fourth
quarter of 2004 such earnings had been permanently reinvested pursuant to the
provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 23 prior to the fourth
quarter of 2004 under the companys previous tax planning strategy to invest
such earnings in operating and nonoperating foreign investments

     this dividend generated significant foreign tax credits that were used to
offset the majority of the us tax on the 2004 dividend and created a 50
million foreign tax credit carryforward at december 31 2004 the company
believes that the foreign tax credit carryforward will be utilized before the
newly
                                        13
page

enacted 10year carryforward period expires on december 31 2014 principally
with identified potential sources of future income taxed in foreign
jurisdictions at rates less than the present us rate of 35 percent therefore
a valuation allowance was not recorded at december 31 2004

     because the company changed its position with respect to the repatriation
of foreign earnings the company recorded a 38 million deferred tax liability
in the fourth quarter of 2004 primarily related to the excess of its book basis
over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries

     other commitments and contingencies

     certain of the companys products and product finishes and services are
generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and
workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the
time of the sale the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs
to provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in
satisfaction of warranty obligations the companys estimate of costs to service
its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of
future conditions to the extent that the company experiences any changes in
warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims its
warranty liability is adjusted accordingly

     the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims
including income taxes with respect to matters generally arising in the
ordinary course of business liabilities and costs associated with these matters
require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and
experience of management and its legal counsel when estimates of the companys
exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for
recognition under sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies amounts are
recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to
the company may differ due to subsequent developments see note t to the
companys consolidated financial statements for information regarding legal
proceedings involving the company

     the company used estimates for the number of claims expected and the
average cost per claim to determine the liability related to the behr litigation
settlement in 2002 in 2004 the company estimated that the remaining unpaid
claims and administration costs related to the washington state settlement would
be less than originally estimated and reduced the related accrual recognizing
income for litigation settlement by 20 million

internal controls and procedures

     the companys operations are highly decentralized and financial and
transaction processing and control systems are distributed across the companys
multiple business units the company maintains monitoring controls through its
group oversight function a companywide accounting policy manual and a
wellresourced internal audit function that works closely with an international
accounting firm which is not the companys external auditor additionally the
company believes it fosters an effective control environment through a strong
corporate governance structure driven by the membership and activities of its
board of directors and audit committee its code of business ethics and various
companywide programs related to legal and ethical compliance

     in 2004 the company conducted and concluded its first comprehensive
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting under the new
requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the act
during the course of this process the company determined that there was a lapse
in controls associated with a business integration involving two of the
companys business units management concluded that the lapse in controls was a
material weakness based on the potential for possible error and impact of such
potential error on the companys consolidated financial statements accordingly
based on the requirements of the act the company concluded that its internal
control over financial reporting did not operate effectively as of december 31

management has taken a number of remediation steps and is in the process of
taking additional steps associated with this matter as disclosed in managements
remediation plan in item 8 of this report

     in addition to the incremental external costs and expenses of approximately
34 million primarily professional fees associated with complying with section
404 of the act the company has also invested significantly in training and
additional infrastructure including additional human resources technological
enhancements and process improvements the company believes it has incurred a
disproportionate level of expense related to this initiative relative to other
companies of comparable size due to its disaggregated business model while the
companys decentralized operating structure and the number of autonomous
business units serve to disperse risk these factors also resulted in a more
timeconsuming and costly environment for the company to implement the
requirements of the act the company with senior management actively involved
began its section 404 implementation process in early 2003 the companys
compliance with the section 404 requirements was highly complex and involved
given the continuing refinement of guidance related to the acts requirements
and the companys decentralized operating structure including disparate
business systems its relatively smaller foreign business units with different
languages and cultures and its installation services businesses with
approximately 360 small branch locations

     nevertheless the company expects to continue to benefit from the
implementation of the acts requirements and is committed to a continuous
improvement model of internal control as evidenced through its significant
investment of resources and its historic strong tone at the top philosophy of
internal control

reduced its estimate of expected proceeds during 2004 recognizing pretax
charges of 139 million 151 million after tax for those businesses expected
to be divested at a loss for these operations as a result of
lowerthanexpected operating results as well as a weakerthanexpected demand
for the businesses that the company planned to divest any gains resulting from
the dispositions are recognized as such transactions are completed the company
expects aggregate net proceeds to approximate 250 million upon completion of
the dispositions of which 172 million was received in 2004

liquidity and capital resources

     historically the company has largely funded its growth through cash
provided by a combination of its operations longterm bank debt and other
borrowings and by the issuance of company common stock including issuances for
certain mergers and acquisitions

     bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds at
december 31 2004 debt agreements with banks syndicated in the united states
relate to a 20 billion 5year revolving credit agreement due and payable in
november 2009 this agreement allows for borrowings denominated in us dollars
or european euros interest is payable on borrowings under this agreement based

availability of up to 39 billion certain debt agreements also contain a
requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth at december 31 2004

     in december 2002 the company replenished the amount of debt and equity
securities issuable under its unallocated shelf registration statement with the
securities and exchange commission pursuant to which the company was able to
issue up to a combined 2 billion of debt and equity securities

500 million

     during 2004 the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend 125
percent to 18 per common share this marks the 46th consecutive year in which
dividends have been increased although the company is aware of the greater
interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend
payout in recent years the company continues to believe that its shareholders
longterm interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its
earnings in the future growth of the company

financial strategies the companys total debt as a percent of total
capitalization increased to 44 percent at december 31 2004 from 43 percent at
december 31 2003 repurchases and retirement of company common stock
contributed to the increase in the total debt to total capitalization ratio the

december 31 2004 consist of interest rate swaps entered into in 2004 for the
purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixedrate debt to variablerate
debt which is expected to reduce interest expense given current interest
rates generally under interest rate swap agreements the company agrees with a
counter party to exchange the difference between fixedrate and floatingrate
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount
the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions thereby
minimizing the risk of credit loss the interest rate swap agreements are
designated as fairvalue hedges and the interest rate differential on interest
rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to
interest expense over the term of the agreement for fairvalue hedge
transactions changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the
fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings

     the average variable interest rates are based on the london interbank
offered rate libor plus a fixed adjustment factor the average effective
rate on the interest rate swaps is 3302 at december 31 2004 the interest
rate swap agreements cover a notional amount of 850 million of the companys
fixedrate debt due july 15 2012 at an interest rate of 5875 the hedges are
considered 100 percent effective because all of the critical terms of the
derivative financial instruments match those of the hedged item accordingly no
gain or loss on the value of the hedges was recognized in the companys
consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2004 and
2003 the amount recognized as a reduction of interest expense was 22 million
for the year ended december 31 2004

outlook for the company

     the company experienced significant commodity cost increases during 2004
which reduced expected gross margins including in the fourth quarter higher
commodity costs reflecting cost increases in 2004 and additional cost increases
in 2005 are expected to impact 2005 first half results the company already has
implemented and continues to implement additional selling price increases on a
number of its products and believes that by the end of the second quarter many
of these commodity cost increases will be largely offset by such price
increases

     the company believes that the impact of the delay in offsetting these
recent cost increases with increased selling prices and the shortage of certain
materials will negatively impact earnings in the first half of 2005 largely in
the first quarter this impact has been reflected in the companys previously
announced guidance

     the company believes that it will achieve further organic sales growth in
2005 and based on current business trends believes that it will achieve
midto highsingledigit organic growth in 2005 resulting in record sales and
earnings

     the company expects its 2005 operating results to be impacted by a decline
in housing starts of five percent from 2004 levels share repurchases of a
minimum 12 million common shares modest margin improvement reflecting selling
price increases and anticipated income from the sale of financial investments
in addition the company is assuming no further significant commodity cost
increases beyond what it has already experienced in early 2005

business segment results discussion

     changes in operating profit margins in the following business segment and
geographic area results discussion exclude general corporate expense the
incomecharge for the litigation settlement net in 2004 2003 and 2002 and the
goodwill impairment charges in 2004 and 2003

     cabinets and related products

     net sales of cabinets and related products increased 14 percent in 2004
compared with 2003 and 9 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 the sales increases
are due primarily to increased sales volume of assembled cabinets largely
through north american retail distribution channels at major home centers and
through the new construction market in the united states as well as a more
favorable product mix this segment was also favorably influenced by a weaker
us dollar in 2004 and 2003 which affected the translation of local currencies
of european operations included in this segment

     operating profit margins were 168 percent 153 percent and 139 percent
for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively operating
profit margins in 2004 reflect the positive impact of higher sales volume as
well as certain cost improvement initiatives operating profit margins in 2003
reflect the positive effect of higher sales volume as well as lower fixed costs
resulting from the rationalization of existing manufacturing capacity operating
profit margins in 2002 were positively influenced by strong sales volume offset
in part by costs related to a discontinued product line

     plumbing products

     net sales of plumbing products increased 14 percent in 2004 compared with
2003 primarily due to increased sales volume in the retail markets in north
america and europe and in the new construction markets in north america net
sales of plumbing products increased 30 percent in 2003 compared with 2002
primarily due to acquisitions principally the acquisition of the majority
interest in hansgrohe in december 2002 a weaker us dollar also had a
favorable impact on the translation of local currencies of european operations
included in this segment in 2004 and 2003

     operating profit margins were 129 percent 134 percent and 165 percent
for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively operating
profit margins in 2004 reflect an increase in european sales which are
generally at lower margins as well as increased material costs offset in part
by increased sales volume operating profit margins in 2003 include the effect
of an acquired company that has lower margins than the segment average as well
as inventory adjustments and a decline in operating margins of certain european
operations operating profit margins in 2002 include the favorable effect of a
16 million pretax gain relating to the reclassification of certain assets to
held and used in accordance with sfas no 144

     during 2003 the company detected that an employee at a united kingdom
business unit in the plumbing products segment had circumvented internal
controls and overstated operating results by approximately 4 million in 2002
this overstatement was corrected in the third quarter of 2003 the company made
the appropriate personnel changes and completed its review of the business unit
in the fourth quarter of 2003 and determined that no further adjustment was
necessary

     installation and other services

     net sales of installation and other services increased 15 percent in 2004
compared with 2003 and 31 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 the increase in
net sales in 2004 is primarily due to increased selling prices increased sales
volume of noninsulation products and a strong new housing market the increase
in net sales in 2003 was principally attributable to acquisitions principally
the acquisition of service partners in september 2002 and a stronger
newhousing market as well as increased sales volume of noninsulation products

     operating profit margins were 129 percent 153 percent and 165 percent
for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the decline
in the 2004 operating profit margins is
                                        23

primarily attributable to the time lag in implementing price increases related
to material cost increases as well as an increase in sales of generally
lowermargin noninsulation products historically the company has generally
been able to increase its selling prices to reflect certain material cost
increases however the company has not yet been able to increase selling prices
to offset all such cost increases contributing to a decline in operating profit
margins the decline in operating profit margins in 2003 is primarily
attributable to adverse weather conditions which reduced sales experienced in
the first half of 2003 as well as increased sales of generally lowermargin
noninsulation products

     within the installation and other services segment the availability of
fiberglass insulation to support the companys installation and distribution
activities was constrained throughout 2004 the high level of demand for
fiberglass insulation as a result of the strength of the new residential
construction market has outpaced the industrys capacity to produce additional
product the company believes that these conditions will persist in 2005 and is
working with its diverse supplier base to secure the appropriate amount of
material at the current time the company believes that it will be able to do
so but if the company cannot obtain the required amount of material this could
have a negative impact on its operations

     decorative architectural products

     net sales of decorative architectural products increased 11 percent in 2004
compared with 2003 and 12 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 the increases in
net sales in 2004 and 2003 are primarily due to higher unit sales volume of
paints and stains as well as increased sales of decorative hardware

     operating profit margins were 206 percent 148 percent and 238 percent
for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the margin
improvement in 2004 includes the effect of increased sales volume of paints and
stains and increased sales volume and improved operating performance of the
companys decorative hardware businesses offset in part by increased material
and promotion costs operating profit margins for this segment in 2003 were
impacted by increased advertising costs including additional costs associated
with new instore paint display centers and fixed asset and inventory
adjustments reflecting excess obsolete and resourced products related to
decorative hardware as previously discussed operating profit in this segment
for 2003 was negatively affected by noncash pretax charges of 55 million
related to a united kingdom business unit the charges relate primarily to a
business system implementation failure which allowed former management of the
business unit to circumvent internal controls and artificially inflate the
units operating profit in years prior to 2003 the operating profit margins in
2002 reflect the leveraging of fixed costs over higher unit sales volume

     other specialty products

     net sales of other specialty products increased 17 percent in 2004 compared
with 2003 principally due to increased sales of vinyl and fiberglass windows
and doors in north america net sales of other specialty products increased 17
percent in 2003 compared with 2002 principally due to acquisitions as well as
increased sales of vinyl windows a weaker us dollar in 2004 and 2003 also had
a favorable effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations
included in this segment

     operating profit margins were 192 percent 182 percent and 197 percent
for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the margin
improvement in 2004 is primarily attributable to increased sales volume of
windows the lower operating profit margins in 2003 are primarily due to
increased material and insurance costs as well as lower results of european
operations the operating profit margins in 2002 were positively influenced by
acquisitions which in aggregate had higher operating profit margins than the
segment average

geographic area results discussion

     north america

     net sales from north american operations increased 13 percent in 2004
compared with 2003 and 14 percent in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to
increased unit sales volume of assembled cabinets faucets installed sales of
insulation and noninsulation products paints and stains and vinyl and
fiberglass windows and doors

     operating profit margins were 166 percent 164 percent and 175 percent
for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively operating
profit margins in 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of
assembled cabinets faucets paints and stains vinyl and fiberglass windows and
doors and installed sales of insulation and noninsulation products operating
profit margins for 2004 were negatively impacted by increased commodity costs
which offset lower sales promotion costs the decline in operating profit
margins for 2003 principally reflect increased sales in segments that have
somewhat lower operating profit margins increased commodity and energy costs as
well as increased advertising and promotion costs the operating profit margins
for 2002 principally reflect the leveraging of fixed costs over increased sales
volume and product mix

     international principally europe

     net sales of the companys international operations increased 21 percent in
2004 compared with 2003 due to increased local currency sales of plumbing
products readytoassemble cabinets and windows net sales of the companys
international operations increased 58 percent in 2003 compared with 2002
primarily due to acquisitions a weaker us dollar had a positive effect on the
translation of european results in 2004 and 2003 increasing european net sales
in 2004 by approximately 12 percent and in 2003 by 16 percent

     operating profit margins were 116 percent 88 percent and 144 percent
for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively operating
profit margins for 2004 were positively affected by increases in sales volume of
plumbing products readytoassemble cabinets and windows operating profit
margins for international operations for 2003 were adversely affected by the
noncash pretax charges relating to accounting irregularities discussed
previously as well as lower margins of recently acquired companies

other matters

     commitments and contingencies

     litigation

     information regarding legal proceedings involving the company is set forth
in note t to the consolidated financial statements

     other commitments

     with respect to the companys investments in private equity funds the
company at december 31 2004 has under certain circumstances commitments to
contribute additional capital to such funds of up to 123 million

     during 2000 approximately 300 of the companys key employees purchased
from the company 84 million shares of company common stock for cash totaling
156 million under an executive stock purchase program program the stock
was purchased at 1850 per share the approximate market price of the common
stock at the time of purchase participants in the program financed their
purchases with fiveyear full recourse personal loans at a market interest
rate from a bank syndicate each participant is fully responsible at all times
for repaying their bank loans when they become due and is personally responsible
for 100 percent of any loss in the market value of the purchased stock

                                        25

the company has guaranteed repayment of the loans for which the aggregate
amount outstanding was approximately 47 million at december 31 2004 only in
the event of a default by a participant the company believes that the
likelihood of any significant defaults by participants on payment of these
loans which are due in mid2005 is remote

     the company enters into contracts which include reasonable and customary
indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which it operates such
indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues
relating to the companys products and workmanship in conjunction with
divestitures and other transactions the company occasionally provides
reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items including
the enforceability of trademarks legal and environmental issues provisions for
sales returns and asset valuations the company has never had to pay a material
amount related to these indemnifications and evaluates the probability that
amounts may be incurred and appropriately records an estimated liability when
probable

     warranty

     certain of the companys products and product finishes and services are
generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and
workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product at the
time of sale the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to
provide products parts or services to repair or replace products in
satisfaction of warranty obligations the companys estimate of costs to service
its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of
future conditions to the extent that the company experiences any changes in
warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims its
warranty liability is adjusted accordingly see note t to the consolidated
financial statements for the tabular disclosure

     a significant portion of the companys business is at the consumer retail
level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product
to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do
not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a
return deduction from the company the companys revenue recognition policy
takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue and deductions
are recorded at the time of sale

additional information

      the consolidation of customers in the companys major distribution
       channels has increased the size and importance of individual customers
       and the ability of these customers to effect significant changes in their
       volume of purchases from individual vendors the company believes its
       relationships with home centers are particularly important sales of the
       companys product lines to home center retailers have increased
       substantially in recent years and in 2003 sales to the companys
       largest customer the home depot were 25 billion approximately 22
       percent of total sales although builders dealers and other retailers

       competitive competition in all of the companys product lines is based
       largely on performance quality brand reputation style delivery
       customer service exclusivity and price competition in the markets for
       the companys services businesses is based primarily on price customer
       service and breadth of product offering although the relative importance
       of such factors varies among product categories price is often a primary
       factor

      the companys international operations are subject to political
       monetary economic and other risks attendant generally to international
       businesses these risks generally vary from country to country results
       of existing european operations have been adversely influenced in recent
       years in part due to softness in the companys european markets
       competitive pricing pressures on certain products and the effect of a
       higher percentage of lower margin sales to total european sales

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

     the financial and business analysis below provides information which the
company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the companys
consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows this
financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes

     the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain
statements reflecting the companys views about its future performance and
constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 these views involve risks and uncertainties that are
difficult to predict and accordingly the companys actual

                                        10
page

results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking
statements readers should consider that various factors including changes in
general economic conditions and competitive market conditions pricing
pressures relationships with key customers industry consolidation of
retailers wholesalers and builders shifts in distribution the influence of e
commerce and other factors discussed in the executive level overview
critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company
sections may affect the companys performance the company undertakes no
obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements as a result of new
information future events or otherwise

executive level overview

     the company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home
improvement and building products these products are sold to the home
improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware
stores home centers builders distributors and other outlets for consumers and
contractors the company also supplies and installs insulation and other
building products for builders in the new construction market

     factors that affect the companys results of operations include the levels
of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north
america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction the
companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure fluctuations
in european currencies primarily the european euro and great britain pound
the importance of and the companys relationships with home centers including
the home depot which represented approximately 22 percent of the companys
sales in 2003 as distributors of home improvement and building products and the
companys ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the
face of increasing global competition historically the company has been able
to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in new
construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and
acquisitions as well as market share gains

critical accounting policies and estimates

     the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods the company regularly reviews its estimates which are based
on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may
differ from these estimates and assumptions

     the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are
affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements

     the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
and incentive offerings including special pricing arrangements promotions and
other volumebased incentives allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are
maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to
make required payments inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net
realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable
inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and
their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market
conditions on an ongoing basis the company monitors these estimates and
records adjustments for

                                        11
page

differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual
results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these
estimates

     the company maintains investments in marketable equity securities and bond
funds which aggregated 517 million and a number of private equity funds
which aggregated 332 million at december 31 2003 the investments in private
equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each
reporting period or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist using
information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions the
investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds are carried at fair
value and unrealized gains and unrealized losses that are deemed to be
temporary are recorded as a component of shareholders equity net of tax
effect in other comprehensive income loss the company records an impairment
charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is
deemed to be otherthantemporary future changes in market conditions the
performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private
equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and
the amounts realized upon liquidation

     the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net
tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable
intangible assets on january 1 2002 statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets became
effective in accordance with sfas no 142 the company is no longer recording
amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible
assets in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company completed the annual
impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets
utilizing a discounted cash flow method this test indicated that goodwill
related to certain european businesses was impaired the company recognized a
noncash pretax impairment charge of 137 million 113 million aftertax in
the fourth quarter of 2003 in the third quarter of 2003 the company also
recognized a noncash impairment charge of 5 million related to a business unit
in the united kingdom as discussed in business segment results intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives the
company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at
each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a
revision to the remaining periods of amortization

     determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the
company to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm
projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates the
companys judgments are based on historical experience current market trends
and other information while the company believes that the estimates and
assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different
assumptions could result in a different outcome in estimating future cash
flows the company relies on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales
and operating profits including capital expenditures and generally a three
percent longterm assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the
fiveyear forecast the company generally develops these forecasts based on
recent sales data for existing products planned timing of new product launches
housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes

     in the fourth quarter of 2003 the company estimated that future discounted
cash flows projected for most of its individual business units were greater than
the carrying values related to business units with goodwill and other
indefinitelived intangible assets any increases in estimated discounted cash
flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill

     accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost
of benefits to be provided in the future based on vested years of service and
attributing those costs over the time period each employee works pension costs
and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations inherent
in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on
plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for

                                        12
page

obligations the company considers current market conditions including changes
in interest rates in selecting these assumptions the company selects these
assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants lawyers
and actuaries changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the
related pension costs and obligations within the companys consolidated
financial statements in any given period

     in 2003 the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to 625
percent from 675 percent which reflects the decline in longterm interest
rates the assumed asset return is 85 percent reflecting the expected
longterm return on plan assets

     the companys underfunded amount for the difference between the projected
benefit obligation and plan assets decreased to 137 million from 183 million
in 2002 this is primarily the result of asset returns above projections and
company contributions the plan assets in 2003 had a net gain of approximately
23 percent as compared with an increase of 21 percent for the largest 1000 plan
benchmark

     the companys projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded
nonqualified supplemental pension plans was 110 million for 2003 compared with
82 million for 2002 the companys underfunded amount for the difference
between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets for its foreign pension
plans was 42 million for 2003 compared with 22 million for 2002

     the company expects pension expense for its definedbenefit plans to
decrease by approximately 7 million in 2004 principally due to higher asset
returns achieved in 2003 compared with the projection if the company assumed
that the future return on plan assets was 8 percent instead of 85 percent the
pension expense for 2004 would increase by approximately 2 million

     the company has considered future income and gains from investments and
other identified taxplanning strategies including the potential sale of
certain operating assets in assessing the need for establishing a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets at december 31 2003 particularly
related to its aftertax capital loss carryforward of 62 million should the
company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its
deferred tax assets in the future a valuation allowance would be recorded in
the period such determination is made

     certain of the companys products and product finishes and services are
generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and
workmanship for periods ranging from one year to lifetime under certain
circumstances of the original purchaser at the time of the sale the company
accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or
services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations
the companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on
historical experience and expectations of future conditions to the extent the
company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated
with servicing those claims its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly

     the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims
including income taxes with respect to matters generally arising in the
ordinary course of business liabilities and costs associated with these matters
require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and
experience of management and its legal counsel when estimates of the companys
exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria of sfas
no 5 accounting for contingencies amounts are recorded as charges to
earnings the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ
due to subsequent developments

     the company used estimates for the number of claims expected and the
average cost per claim to determine the liability related to the behr litigation
settlement in 2002 in 2003 the company received a fraction of the claims
originally estimated and reduced its accrual for litigation settlement by 58
million

corporate development strategy

     acquisitions over the last several years have enabled the company to build
a unique critical mass that has given the company a strong position in the
markets it serves and has increased the companys importance to its customers
the company is now intensifying its focus on leveraging the critical mass to
build greater value for its shareholders going forward the company will have a
more balanced growth strategy of internal growth share repurchases and fewer
acquisitions with increased emphasis on cash flow and return on invested
capital as part of its strategic planning the company continues to review all
of its businesses to determine which businesses are core to continuing
operations

     the company reviews its business portfolio on an ongoing basis as part of
its corporate strategic planning and in the first quarter of 2004 has
determined that several european businesses are not core to the companys
longterm growth strategy and accordingly has embarked on a plan of
disposition these businesses had combined 2003 net sales in excess of 350

liquidity and capital resources

     historically the company has largely funded its growth through cash
provided by a combination of its operations longterm bank debt and other
borrowings and by the issuance of company common stock including issuances for
certain mergers and acquisitions

     bank credit lines are maintained to ensure the availability of funds the
credit lines with banks syndicated in the united states at december 31 2003
include a 125 billion amended and restated 5year revolving credit agreement
due and payable in november 2005 and a 750 million 364day revolving credit
agreement that expires in november 2004 these agreements allow for borrowings
denominated in us dollars or european euros the previous 364day revolving
credit agreement expired in november 2003 there were no borrowings under either
agreement during 2003 interest is payable on borrowings under these agreements
based on various floating rate options as selected by the company

     certain debt agreements contain limitations on additional borrowings at
december 31 2003 the company had additional borrowing capacity subject to
availability of up to 25 billion certain debt agreements also contain a
requirement for maintaining a certain level of net worth at december 31 2003
the companys net worth exceeded such requirement by approximately 2 billion

     in december 2002 the company replenished the amount of debt and equity
securities issuable under its unallocated shelf registration statement with the
securities and exchange commission pursuant to which the company is able to
issue up to a combined 2 billion of debt and equity securities in addition
the company increased its shelf registration related to common stock that can be
issued in connection with acquisitions to 50 million shares

     the company had cash and cash investments of 795 million at december 31
2003 as a result of strong cash flows from operations and the disposition of
certain businesses in 2003

     during 2003 the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend 14
percent to 16 per common share this marks the 45th consecutive year in which
dividends have been increased although the company is aware of the greater
interest in yield by many investors and has maintained an increased dividend
payout in recent years the company continues to believe that its shareholders
longterm interests are best served by investing a significant portion of its
earnings in the future growth of the company

     maintaining high levels of liquidity and cash flow are among the companys
financial strategies the companys total debt as a percent of total
capitalization decreased to 43 percent at december 31 2003 from 47 percent at
december 31 2002 the companys working capital ratio was 18 to 1 and 20 to 1
at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

     the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and does not use derivatives for trading purposes the derivatives used by the
company for the year ended december 31 2003 consist of interest rate swaps
entered into late in 2003 for the purpose of effectively converting a portion
of fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt which is expected to reduce interest
expense given current interest rates certain of the companys european
operations also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts for the purpose
of managing exposure to currency fluctuations related to the united states
dollar and the great britain pound generally under interest rate swaps the
company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixedrate
and floatingrate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional
principal amount the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy
institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss the interest rate
swaps are considered a fairvalue hedge and the interest rate differential on
interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment
to interest expense or income over the term of the agreement for fairvalue
hedge transactions changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in
the fair value of the item hedged are recorded in determining earnings
                                        15
page

     the average variable interest rates are based on the london interbank
offered rate libor plus a fixed adjustment factor the average effective
rate on the interest rate swaps is 225 the interest rate swap agreements
cover a notional amount of 850 million of the companys fixedrate debt due
july 15 2012 at an interest rate of 5875 the hedge is considered 100 percent
effective because all of the critical terms of the derivative financial
instruments match those of the hedged item accordingly no gain or loss on the
value of the hedge was recognized in the companys statement of income for the
year ended december 31 2003 the amount recognized as an adjustment reduction
of interest expense was approximately 3 million for the year ended december 31
2003

business segment results discussion

     changes in operating profit margins in the following business segment and
geographic area results discussion exclude general corporate expense the
incomecharge for the litigation settlement net the goodwill impairment charge
in 2003 and goodwill amortization expense in 2001

     cabinets and related products

     net sales of cabinets and related products increased 9 percent in 2003
compared with 2002 due primarily to increased sales volume of assembled cabinets
largely through north american retail distribution channels at major home
centers and through the new construction market in the united states as well as
a more favorable product mix net sales of cabinets and related products
increased 9 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due to increased sales volume of
cabinets largely through expansion of north american retail distribution
channels at major home centers as well as new product introductions this
segment was favorably influenced by a weaker us dollar in 2003 and 2002 which
affected the translation of local currencies of european operations included in
this segment

     operating profit margins were 146 percent 135 percent and 105 percent
for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively operating
profit margins in 2003 reflect the positive effect of higher sales volume as
well as lower fixed costs resulting from the rationalization of existing
manufacturing capacity operating profit margins in 2002 were positively
influenced by increased unit sales volume profit improvement initiatives and
the reduction of both plant shutdown costs and other asset writedowns offset
in part by costs related to a discontinued product line operating profit
margins in 2001 were negatively influenced by plant shutdown costs the
underabsorption of fixed costs higher energy costs increased bad debt expense
and the lower results of european operations

     plumbing products

     net sales of plumbing products increased 30 percent in 2003 compared with
2002 primarily due to acquisitions principally the acquisition of the majority
interest in hansgrohe in december 2002 as well as the effect of a weaker us
dollar which had a favorable impact on the translation of local currencies of
european operations included in this segment net sales of plumbing products
increased 17 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 due to the favorable influence
of new product introductions which contributed to higher unit sales volume of
faucets to retailers in 2002 as well as increased growth in the wholesale
distribution channels the increase in sales of plumbing products in 2002 also
includes the influence of inventory reduction programs of certain key customers
in the first six months of 2001 which reduced sales in 2001 and favorably
influenced the 2002 versus 2001 comparisons

     operating profit margins were 133 percent 164 percent and 142 percent
for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively operating
profit margins in 2003 include the effect of a recently acquired company that
has lower margins than the segment average as well as inventory adjustments and
a decline in operating margins of certain european operations including a
noncash pretax charge of approximately 4 million relating to a united
kingdom business unit as discussed below operating profit margins in 2002
include the favorable effect of a 16 million pretax gain relating to the
reclassification of certain assets to held and used in accordance with sfas no
144 operating profit margins in 2002 were favorably affected by the leveraging
of fixed costs over increased unit sales volume as well as the companys profit
improvement initiatives operating profit margins in 2001 were negatively
affected by competitive pricing pressures and the lower results of european
companies

     during 2003 the company detected that an employee at a united kingdom
business unit in the plumbing products segment had circumvented internal
controls and overstated operating
                                        21
page

results by approximately 4 million in 2002 this overstatement was corrected in
the third quarter of 2003 the company made the appropriate personnel changes
and completed its review of the business unit in the fourth quarter of 2003 and
determined that no further adjustment was necessary

     installation and other services

     net sales of installation and other services increased 31 percent in 2003
compared with 2002 and 9 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 the increase in net
sales for this segment in 2003 and 2002 was principally attributable to
acquisitions principally the acquisition of service partners in september 2002
and a stronger newhousing market as well as increased sales of noninsulation
products operating profit margins were 153 percent 165 percent and 170
percent for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the
decline in operating profit margins in 2003 is primarily attributable to adverse
weather conditions which reduced sales experienced in the first half of 2003
as well as increased sales of generally lowermargin noninsulation products

     decorative architectural products

     net sales of decorative architectural products increased 12 percent in 2003
compared with 2002 net sales of decorative architectural products increased 10
percent in 2002 compared with 2001 the increases in net sales in 2003 and 2002
are primarily due to higher unit sales volume of paints stains and decorative
hardware through north american retail distribution channels

     operating profit margins were 144 percent 229 percent and 223 percent
for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively operating
profit margins for this segment in 2003 were impacted by increased advertising
costs including additional costs associated with new instore paint display
centers and fixed asset and inventory adjustments reflecting excess obsolete
and resourced products related to decorative hardware operating profit margins
for 2003 also include the effect of a noncash pretax charge of approximately
55 million related to a united kingdom business unit discussed below

     during 2003 the company recorded a noncash pretax charge which reduced
operating profit by approximately 35 million with respect to a united kingdom
business unit in the decorative architectural products segment the charge
relates primarily to a business system implementation failure which allowed
former management to circumvent internal controls and artificially inflate the
units operating profit in years prior to 2003 the company also determined that
goodwill was impaired and recorded a 5 million charge in the third quarter of
2003

     finally the company determined that the strategic plan for this business
unit relative to certain product offerings and customer focus should be
changed this revision in operating strategy resulted in 2003 charges
aggregating approximately 15 million principally related to inventories and
receivables

     the company is implementing changes to its operational and financial
structure in europe which include reorganizing its european business operations
into product groups the addition of group operating and financial personnel
training and evaluation related to internal controls and the expansion of both
external and internal audit involvement

     other specialty products

     net sales of other specialty products increased 16 percent in 2003 compared
with 2002 principally due to acquisitions as well as increased sales of vinyl
windows net sales of other specialty products increased 42 percent in 2002
compared with 2001 principally due to acquisitions as well as increased sales
of vinyl windows a weaker us dollar in 2003 also had a

                                        22

favorable effect on the translation of local currencies of european operations
included in this segment

     operating profit margins were 181 percent 195 percent and 194 percent
for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the
operating margin decline in this segment is primarily due to increased material
and insurance costs as well as lower results of european operations the
improvement in operating profit margins in 2002 was primarily due to lower
levels of bad debt expense and asset writedowns in 2002 compared with 2001 the
operating profit margins in 2001 were also negatively affected by the lower
results of european operations

geographic area results discussion

     north america

2002 primarily due to acquisitions as well as increased unit sales volume of
assembled cabinets installed sales of noninsulation products paints and
stains and vinyl windows net sales from north american operations increased 14

sales of certain products including cabinets paints and stains vinyl windows
and faucets

for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decline
in operating profit margins for 2003 principally reflects increased sales in
segments that have somewhat lower operating profit margins increased energy
costs as well as increased advertising and promotion costs the improvement in
operating profit margins for 2002 principally reflects the leveraging of fixed
costs over increased sales volume product mix and the influence of the
companys profit improvement initiatives

     international principally europe

     net sales of the companys international operations increased 49 percent in
2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to acquisitions as well as a weaker us
dollar which had a favorable influence on the translation of international sales

european results in 2003 compared with 2002 increasing european net sales in
2003 by approximately 17 percent net sales of the companys international
operations increased 15 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 primarily due to

for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively operating
profit margins for international operations for 2003 were adversely affected by
the noncash pretax charges relating to accounting irregularities discussed
previously as well as lower margins of recently acquired companies operating
profit margins for international operations for 2002 benefited from profit
improvement initiatives operating profit margins for 2001 include the effect of
plant startup and system implementation costs

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

     the financial and business analysis below provides information which the
company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the companys
consolidated financial position and results of operations this financial and
business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and related notes

     the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain
statements reflecting the companys views about its future performance and
constitute forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 these views involve risks and uncertainties that are
difficult to predict and accordingly the companys actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements
readers should consider that various factors including changes in general
economic conditions and competitive market conditions pricing pressures
relationships with key customers industry consolidation of retailers
wholesalers and builders shifts in distribution the influence of ecommerce
and other factors discussed in the overview critical accounting policies and
estimates and outlook for the company sections may affect the companys
performance the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any
forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or
otherwise

overview

     the company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home
improvement and building products these products are sold to the home
improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers hardware
stores home centers distributors and other outlets for consumers and
contractors the company also supplies and installs insulation and other
building products for builders in the new construction market

     factors that affect the companys results of operations include the levels
of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north
america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction the
companys ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure fluctuations
in european currencies primarily the european euro and british pound the
importance of and the companys relationships with home centers including the
home depot which represented approximately 25 percent of the companys sales in
2002 as distributors of home improvement and building products and the
companys ability to

                                        10
page

maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing
global competition historically the company has been able to largely offset
the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in new construction and home
improvement markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well
as market share gains

critical accounting policies and estimates

     the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and
results of operations are based on the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions
which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions

     the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are
affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements

     the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
and incentive offerings including special pricing arrangements promotions and
other volumebased incentives allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are
maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to
make required payments inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market
with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to
the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated
market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions on
an ongoing basis the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments
for differences between estimates and actual experience historically actual
results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these
estimates

     the company maintains investments in marketable equity securities and bond
funds which aggregated 446 million and a number of private equity funds
which aggregated 448 million at december 31 2002 the investments in private
equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each
reporting period or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist using
information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions the
investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds are carried at fair
value and unrealized gains and unrealized losses that are deemed to be
temporary are recorded as a component of shareholders equity net of tax in
other comprehensive income the company records an impairment charge to earnings
when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be
otherthantemporary future changes in market conditions the performance of
underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund
managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts
realized upon liquidation

     the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net
tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable
intangible assets on january 1 2002 statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets became
effective in accordance with sfas no 142 the company is no longer recording
amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible
assets the company completed the transitional goodwill and other
indefinitelived intangible assets impairment testing in 2002 and recorded a
noncash goodwill impairment charge of 924 million net of income tax credit
of 244 million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
effective january 1 2002 see cumulative effect of accounting change for
additional discussion

                                        11
page

of the adoption of this standard in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company
completed the annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived
intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow method this test indicated
that no additional impairment of such assets occurred in 2002 intangible assets
with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives the
company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at
each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a
revision to the remaining periods of amortization

     determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the
company to make significant estimates and assumptions including longterm
projections of cash flows market conditions and appropriate discount rates the
companys judgments are based on historical experience current market trends
and other information while the company believes that the estimates and
assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable different
assumptions could result in a different outcome in estimating future cash
flows the company relies on internally generated fiveyear forecasts for sales
and operating profits including capital expenditures and a three percent
longterm assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the fiveyear
forecast the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales
data for existing products planned timing of new product launches housing
starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes

     in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company estimated that future discounted
cash flows projected for individual business units were greater than the
carrying values related to business units with goodwill and other
indefinitelived intangible assets any increases in estimated discounted cash
flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill in contrast if
the current estimate of future discounted cash flows had been 20 percent lower
the company would have been required to recognize a pretax impairment loss of
approximately 43 million

     accounting for definedbenefit pension plans involves estimating the cost
of benefits to be provided in the future based on vested years of service and
attributing those costs over the time period each employee works pension costs
and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations inherent
in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation expected return on
plan assets mortality rates compensation increases and discount rates for
obligations the company considers current market conditions including changes
in interest rates in selecting these assumptions the company selects these
assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants lawyers
and actuaries changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the
related pension costs and obligations within the companys consolidated
financial statements in any given period

     in 2002 the company decreased its discount rate to 675 percent from 75
percent which reflects the decline in longterm interest rates the assumed
asset return is 85 percent reflecting the expected longterm return on plan
assets the plan assets were invested in equities 85 percent bonds 8
percent and cash 7 percent at december 31 2002

     the companys underfunded amount for the difference between the projected
benefit obligation and plan assets increased to 182 million from 59 million in
2001 this is the result of the change in the discount rate plan amendments
asset returns below projections and the inclusion of the furnishings
international inc pension obligation of approximately 83 million at december
31 2002 see note d to the consolidated financial statements the plan assets
in 2002 had a loss of approximately 15 percent as compared with declines of 17
percent and 23 percent for the dow jones industrial average and the standard 
poors 500 respectively

     the company expects pension expense for its defined benefit plans to
increase by approximately 10 million in 2003 principally as a result of lower
asset returns if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was
8 percent instead of 85 percent the impact on pension expense for 2003 would
be an increase of approximately 1 million

                                        12

     the company has considered future income and gains from investments and
other identified tax planning strategies including the potential sale of
certain operating assets in assessing the need for establishing a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets at december 31 2002 should the
company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its
deferred tax assets in the future a valuation allowance would be recorded in
the period such determination is made

     certain of the companys products and product finishes and services are
generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and
workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the lifetime under certain
circumstances of the original purchaser at the time of sale the company
accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or
service to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations
the companys estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on
historical experience and expected future conditions to the extent that the
company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated
with servicing those claims its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly

     the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with
respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and
judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and
its legal counsel when estimates of the companys exposure for lawsuits and
pending or asserted claims meet the criteria of sfas no 5 accounting for
contingencies amounts are recorded as charges to earnings the ultimate
resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent
developments

corporate development

     mergers and acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to
mascos growth generally the earnings benefit to masco arises from the
subsequent growth of merged and acquired businesses since incremental sales are
not impacted by the initial transactionrelated costs and expenses such as
interest and added depreciation and amortization

improvement products and service companies including brasstech inc and bristan

approximately 12 billion including cash of 699 million assumed debt of 81
million and company common stock valued at 399 million at december 31 2002
hansgrohe ag had 45 million of bank and other debt the excess of net purchase
price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired was approximately 1
billion of this amount 42 million based primarily on independent appraisals
was allocated to other identifiable intangible assets including 19 million to
registered trademarks that are not subject to amortization and approximately 23
million to other definitelived intangible assets the remaining excess purchase
price of approximately 1 billion represented acquired goodwill of the goodwill
and other identifiable intangible assets the company estimates that
approximately 270 million will be deductible for income tax purposes

financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition had these

planned disposition of businesses

     in december 2000 the company adopted a plan to dispose of several
businesses that the company believed were not core to its longterm growth
strategies management estimated the expected proceeds from these planned
dispositions based on various analyses including valuations by certain
specialists for certain of these businesses the related carrying value
exceeded expected proceeds accordingly a noncash pretax charge of 90
million was recorded in december 2000 with adjustments to goodwill of 60
million and other longlived assets of 30 million

business for cash proceeds of approximately 15 million which approximated book

metal products businesses for cash proceeds of approximately 232 million which
approximated their combined book values in addition the company continues to
guarantee the value of 16 million shares of company common stock at a stock
price of 40 per share related to the inrecon transaction through june 2004

marked to market each reporting period starmark was included in the cabinets
and related products segment inrecon was included in the installation and other
services segment and american metal products was included in the other specialty

156 million related to certain longlived assets which were written down in
december 2000 as part of the companys plan for disposition the gain resulted
from an adjustment of the assets to the lower

management of fii advised the company that it was pursuing the disposition of
all of its businesses and that the expected consideration from the sale of such

down this investment to approximately 133 million which represented the
approximate fair value of the consideration ultimately expected to be received
from fii for the repayment of the indebtedness during the second quarter of

nonmasco shareholders of fii contributed their fii shares back to fii resulting
in masco becoming the majority shareholder accordingly the remaining assets

     cabinets and related products

     net sales of cabinets and related products increased 10 percent in 2002
compared with 2001 due to increased sales volume of cabinets largely through
expansion of north american retail distribution channels at major home centers
as well as new product introductions net sales of cabinets and related products
decreased 1 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 primarily due to competitive
pricing pressures to maintain market share in a flat new construction market a
reduction in sales of readytoassemble products to a certain customer reduced
renovation and remodeling activity and lost sales to certain retail customers
who declared bankruptcy in 2000 this segment was also negatively influenced by
a stronger us dollar in 2001 and 2000 which affected the translation of local
currencies of european operations included in this segment

     operating profit margins were 135 percent 105 percent and 132 percent
for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively operating
profit margins in 2002 were positively influenced by increased unit sales
volume profit improvement initiatives and the reduction of both plant shutdown
costs and other asset writedowns offset in part by costs related to a
discontinued product line in addition to the influence of pricing pressures
operating profit margins in 2001 were negatively influenced by plant shutdown
costs the underabsorption of fixed costs higher energy costs increased bad
debt expense and the lower results of european cabinet companies operating
profit margins in 2001 also include the effect of plant startup and system
implementation costs related to a european cabinet company

     plumbing products

     net sales of plumbing products increased 11 percent in 2002 compared with
2001 due to the favorable influence of new product introductions which
contributed to higher unit sales volume of faucets to retailers in 2002 as well
as increased growth in the wholesale distribution channels the increase in
sales of plumbing products in 2002 also includes the influence of inventory
reduction programs of certain key customers in the first six months of 2001
which reduced sales in 2001 and favorably influenced the 2002 versus 2001
comparisons net sales of plumbing products decreased 5 percent in 2001 compared
with 2000 due principally to lower unit sales volume related to a weaker economy
and customer inventory reduction programs competitive pricing pressures and to
a lesser extent a stronger us dollar

     operating profit margins were 164 percent 142 percent and 157 percent
for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively operating
profit margins in 2002 were favorably affected by the leveraging of fixed costs
over increased unit sales volume as well as the companys profit improvement
initiatives operating profit margins in 2002 also include the favorable effect
of a 156 million pretax gain relating to the reclassification of certain
assets to held and used in accordance with sfas no 144 operating profit
margins in 2001 were negatively affected by competitive pricing pressures the
lower results of european companies higher energy costs and product mix
including an increased percentage of lower margin faucet units initiatives in
2001 including investments in new product and systems development and the
repricing of certain of the companys faucet units also contributed to the
decline in 2001 operating profit margins operating profit margins in 2000 were
negatively affected by

competitive pricing pressures higher energy costs and the 40 million charge

     installation and other services

     net sales of installation and other services increased 3 percent in 2002
compared with 2001 and 10 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 the increase in
net sales for this segment in 2002 was principally attributable to increases in
sales of noninsulation installed products which offset lower market pricing
related to lower insulation material purchase costs as a result of integration
activities related to a significant acquisition in early 2001 geographic market
penetration activities at existing operations were not as significant in 2001
operating profit margins were 165 percent 170 percent and 168 percent for
the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

     decorative architectural products

     net sales of decorative architectural products increased 9 percent in 2002
compared with 2001 due largely to higher unit sales volume of paints stains and
decorative hardware through north american retail distribution channels net
sales of decorative architectural products increased 4 percent in 2001 compared
with 2000 due to higher unit sales volume of paints and stains offset in part
by a reduction in decorative lock and hardware sales

     operating profit margins were 211 percent 192 percent and 191 percent
for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the
improvement in operating profit margins for this segment reflect the leveraging
of fixed costs over higher unit sales volume the absence of plant startup and
relocation costs that contributed to lower operating margins in 2001 and lower
levels of bad debt expense and certain asset writedowns in 2002 compared with
2001

     other specialty products

     net sales of other specialty products increased 2 percent in 2002 compared
with 2001 principally due to increased sales of vinyl windows a weaker us
dollar also had a favorable effect on the translation of local currencies of
european operations included in this segment net sales of other specialty
products decreased 8 percent in 2001 compared with 2000 due to continued
economic weakness and inventory reduction programs with certain customers a
strong us dollar in 2001 and 2000 had a negative effect on the translation of
local currencies of european operations included in this segment

     operating profit margins were 193 percent 174 percent and 163 percent
for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the
improvement in operating profit margins in 2002 was positively influenced by
recent acquisitions which in the aggregate have higher operating profit margins
than the segment average as well as lower levels of bad debt expense and asset
writedowns in 2002 compared with 2001 the operating profit margins in 2001
were also negatively affected by the lower results of european operations

     operating profit margin in 2000 was negatively affected by a 10 million
charge for the planned disposition of businesses and by the lower margins of
certain european operations included in this segment

profit margins than the international operations average operating profit
margins for 2001 include the effect of plant startup and system implementation

disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of
indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107
and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34 this new interpretation clarifies
that a guarantor is required to disclose a the nature of the guarantee
including the approximate term of the guarantee how the guarantee arose and
the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under
the guarantee b the maximum potential amount of future payments under the
guarantee c the carrying amount of the liability if any for the guarantors
obligations under the guarantee and d the nature and extent of any recourse
provisions or available collateral that would enable the guarantor to recover
the amounts paid under the guarantee regarding product warranties fin 45
specifies that instead of disclosing the maximum potential amount of future
payments companies should disclose the guarantors accounting policy and

     warranty

     certain of the companys products and product finishes and services are
generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and
workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the lifetime under certain
circumstances of the original purchaser at the time of sale the company
accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products parts or
service to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations
the companys

estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical
experience and expected future conditions to the extent that the company
experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with
servicing those claims its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly see note
s to the consolidated financial statements for the tabular disclosure

     a significant portion of the companys business is at the consumer retail
level through home centers and major retailers a consumer may return a product
to a retail outlet that is a warranty return however certain retail outlets do

return deduction from the company the companys revenue recognition policy
takes into account this type of return when recognizing income and deductions
are recorded at the time of sale
