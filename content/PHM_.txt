homebuilding operations 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us during 2021 we operated out of an average of 799 active communities in 41 markets across 24 states we offer a broad product line to meet the needs of homebuyers in our targeted markets through our brands which include centex pulte homes del webb divosta homes john wieland homes and neighborhoods and american west we offer a wide variety of home designs with varying levels of options and amenities to our major customer groups firsttime moveup and active adult during 2021 we delivered home closings totaling 28894 homes compared with 24624 homes in 2020 and 23232 homes in 2019 over our history we have delivered nearly 775000 homes 

we predominantly sell singlefamily detached homes which represented 84 of our home closings in 2021 and 85 in both 2020 and 2019 the remaining units consist of attached homes such as townhomes condominiums and duplexes sales prices of home closings during 2021 ranged from approximately 150000 to over 2500000 with 88 falling within the range of 250000 to 750000 the average unit selling price in 2021 was 463000 compared with 430000 in 2020 and 427000 in 2019 

strategy 

we believe that national publiclytraded builders have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to access more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets control and entitle large land positions gain better access to scarce labor resources and achieve greater geographic and product diversification among our national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit from this scale and diversification in any market conditions our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

• drive operational gains and asset efficiency in support of high returns over the housing cycle 

• shorten the duration of our owned land pipeline to improve returns and reduce risks including targeting a longterm balance of approximately three years of supply each for owned and optioned land approximately six years of supply in total 

• maintain disciplined business practices to maximize returns on investment 

• increase scale within our existing markets by appropriately expanding market share among our primary buyer groups firsttime moveup and active adult 

• focus on buildingtoorder while maintaining an appropriate balance of speculative homes and 

• manage the companys capital consistent with our stated priorities invest in the business fund our dividend maintain a modest leverage profile and routinely return excess funds to shareholders through share repurchases 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to meet the needs of consumers we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option agreements which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements can serve to enhance our expected returns on our land investments and reduce the financial risk associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in certain of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development or if we determine that such parcels no longer fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is zoned and developed or is ready for development for our intended use where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and when needed local government authorities who construct roads and sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2021 we controlled 228296 lots of which 109078 were owned and 119218 were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined homebuyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the needs of potential homebuyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each consumer group through our understanding of each consumer group we seek to provide homes that better meet the needs and wants of each homebuyer 

our homes targeted to firsttime homebuyers tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices and higher density moveup homebuyers tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we address the needs of active adults many of these active adult communities are agerestricted to homebuyers aged fiftyfive and over and are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including athletic facilities recreational centers and educational classes to facilitate the homebuyer maintaining an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than firsttime or moveup homebuyer communities during 2021 32 43 and 25 of our home closings were to firsttime moveup and active adult customers respectively which reflects a slight increase toward firsttime buyers since 2020 consistent with our continued investment in serving firsttime buyers 

we believe that we are an innovator in home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams supplemented by outside consultants follow a disciplined product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of house floor plans and elevations in each community including potential options and upgrades such as different 

flooring countertop fixture and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

we market our homes to prospective homebuyers through internet listings and link placements social media mobile applications media advertising illustrated brochures and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays techenabled customers this includes our websites  wwwpultecom wwwcentexcom wwwdelwebbcom wwwdivostacom wwwjwhomescom and wwwamericanwesthomescom  which provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us 

our sales teams consist primarily of commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve independent third party sales brokers our sales consultants are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process including selecting the community house floor plan and options that meet the customers needs we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which seeks to ensure that homebuyers are engaged and satisfied at every stage of the process fully furnished and landscaped model homes physically located in our communities which leverage the expertise of our interior designers are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have also introduced virtual reality walkthroughs of our house floor plans in certain communities to provide prospective homebuyers with a more costeffective means to provide a realistic vision of our homes 

the majority of our homes are sold on a builttoorder basis where we do not begin construction of the home until we have a signed contract with a customer however we also build speculative homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete more effectively with existing homes available in the market especially for homebuyers that require a home within a short time frame we determine our speculative home strategy for each community based on local market factors and maintain a level of speculative home inventory based on our current and planned sales pace and construction cadence for the community 

our sales contracts with customers generally require payment of a deposit at the time of contract signing and sometimes additional deposits upon selection of certain options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts also typically include a financing contingency that provides customers with the right to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may also include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 99 billion 18003 units at december 31 2021 and 68 billion 15158 units at december 31 2020 this increase in 2021 backlog compared to 2020 is primarily the result of overall robust demand for new housing coupled with elongated cycle times due to supply chain delays for certain materials and labor and obtaining necessary approvals permits and inspections from local municipalities for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2021 substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2022 though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of contract cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that establish a specific scope of work at an agreedupon price using a selective process we have aligned with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver quality throughout all aspects of the house construction process in addition our construction field managers and customer care associates interact with our homebuyers throughout the construction process and instruct homebuyers on postclosing home maintenance 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to build superior quality homes while maintaining efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and by following industry and companyspecific construction practices we maintain high quality product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

• common management of house plans to deliver house designs that customers value the most and that can be built at the highest quality and at an efficient cost 

• value engineering our house plans to optimize house designs in terms of material content and ease of construction while still providing a clear value to the customer 

• utilizing our proprietary construction standards and practices training of our field leadership and construction personnel communication with our suppliers and auditing our compliance through the use of both internal and third party construction experts and 

• working with our suppliers using a data driven collaborative method to reduce construction costs 

generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources however the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete resin copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices national tariffs and other trade factors additionally the ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices remains challenging as labor supply growth has not kept pace with construction demand to protect against changes in construction costs labor and materials costs are generally established prior to or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize costs however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future for example labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to industry growth and the covid19 pandemic has increased demand for our homes outpacing the growth of the residential construction labor pool additionally the supply of certain building materials is limited and has been impacted by the combination of strong consumer demand and disruptions in the global supply chain caused by the covid19 pandemic and major weather events at the point of manufacture of certain products this increase in demand supply chain disruptions and the consolidation of ownership of the source of supply for certain building materials combined to significantly increase the prices of those materials as a result during 2021 in all of our markets we experienced supply chain constraints increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor increased costs or shortages of materials caused increases in construction costs and construction delays given the strong demand for housing in 2021 we have generally been able to pass such cost increases on to customers but we cannot be certain that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 4 of us new home sales in 2021 in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rental housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees suppliers and subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate additionally we may experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay our anticipated development and construction activities in our communities 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating through a captive business model targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all of our loan production we originated the mortgage loans for 73 of the homes we closed in both 2021 and 2020 and 67 in 2019 other home closings are settled via either cash which typically represent approximately 15 of home closings or third party lenders 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center for our mortgage operations that performs underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either indemnify the investor for potential future losses repurchase the loan from the investor or reimburse the investors actual losses 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

our insurance brokerage operations serve as a broker for home auto and other personal insurance policies in select markets to buyers of homes we sell all such insurance policies are placed with third party insurance carriers

 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

risks associated with our industry 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and a deterioration in industry conditions or downward changes in general economic or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income product affordability availability of financing inflation and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

for example beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy during this period we incurred significant losses including impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets and some aspects of the housing industry have yet to return to pre2007 production levels 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through pulte mortgage mortgage interest rates in recent years have been at or near historic lows thereby making new homes more affordable increases in interest rates could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs resulting from higher interest rates or to obtain mortgage financing for example during 2018 we experienced lower than expected conversions of traffic to signups especially among firsttime and moveup buyers beginning in may 2018 when mortgage rates increased similarly the federal reserve has recently announced that it plans to increase the federal borrowing interest rate multiple times in 2022 which could negatively impact new home purchases 

a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing generally could also adversely impact the market for new homes which could result from lenders increasing the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjusting their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have historically had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of our business 

the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans additionally the availability of fha and va mortgage financing which is subject to the same interest rate and lending term risks is an important factor in marketing some of our homes and reduced availability of these financing options could negatively impact our results of operations 

inflation has resulted in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which may have a negative impact on demand for our homes in an inflationary environment economic conditions and other market factors may make it difficult for us to raise home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins or reduce the number of consumers who can afford to purchase one of our homes although the rate of inflation has been historically low in recent years we are currently experiencing historically significant increases in the prices of labor and certain materials as a result of the covid19 pandemic and increased demand for new homes these increases have increased our operational costs in recent periods and if the current inflationary environment continues or worsens we may not be able to adjust the pricing we charge for homes to offset these increased costs in the future which would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to industry growth and the labor force has lost significant time due to people infected with covid19 consumer demand for our homes has also increased beyond the growth of the residential construction labor pool which has been stunted by the covid19 pandemic and related responsive measures additionally the supply of certain building materials especially lumber woodbased materials such as roof and floor trusses and oriented strand boards steel resin concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is limited and has been impacted by the combination of strong consumer demand disruptions in the global supply chain caused by the covid19 pandemic and major weather events at the point of manufacture of certain products this increase in demand and the consolidation of ownership of the source of supply for certain building materials have combined to significantly increase the prices of those materials as a result during 2021 we experienced supply chain constraints increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor in all of our markets increased costs and shortages of labor and materials have caused increases in construction costs construction delays and increased backlog which required us to moderate lot releases and pace new orders in the majority of our communities we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build we experience significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

if the market value of our land drops significantly our profits could decrease and result in writedowns of the carrying values of land we own 

the market value of land can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing 

demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating land option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss at times we have been required to record significant writedowns of the carrying value of our land inventory and we have elected not to exercise options to purchase land even though that required us to forfeit deposits and writeoff preacquisition costs if market conditions were to deteriorate in the future we could again be required to record significant write downs to our land inventory which would decrease the asset values reflected on our balance sheet and materially and adversely affect our earnings and our stockholders equity 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the us housing industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete for homebuyers in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building safety environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these assessments have increased over recent years as other funding mechanisms have decreased causing local governing authorities to seek greater contributions from homebuilders all of these factors can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in some cases to select and obtain building materials despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures in some cases subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials in such cases it can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes we record warranty and other reserves relating to the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built 

we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by us policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by us we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves may not be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future and there is typically a lag between our payment of claims and reimbursements from applicable insurance carriers contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

we can be injured by improper acts of persons over whom we do not have control or by the attempt to impose liabilities or obligations of third parties on us 

although we expect all of our subcontractors employees officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws rules and regulations there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable laws regulations or governmental guidelines when we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws regulations or government guidelines including practices relating to homes buildings or multifamily properties we build or finance we move to stop the noncomplying practices as soon as possible and we have taken disciplinary action regarding subcontractors and employees of ours who were aware of noncomplying practices and did not take steps to address them including in some instances terminating their employment however regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws regulations or government guidelines we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties and our reputation can be injured due to the practices having taken place 

the homes we sell are built by employees of subcontractors and other contract parties we do not have the ability to control what these contract parties pay their employees or subcontractors or the work rules they impose on their employees or subcontractors however various governmental agencies have attempted to hold contract parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other workrelated laws by firms whose employees are performing contracted services governmental rulings or changes in state or local laws that make us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us in situations that are not within our control 

natural disasters severe weather conditions and changing climate patterns could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas for instance in 2019 several hurricanes caused disruptions in our southeastern coastal markets but did not result in a material impact to our results of operations in addition while they also did not have a material impact on our business in 2019  2021 the increased prevalence of forest fires in our western markets have caused disruptions to our sales operations and development delays significant weather events have contributed to plant closures and transportation delays that have exacerbated stress on our supply chain furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

government restrictions standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy transportation or raw material costs which could reduce our housing gross profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations for example as the risk of flooding in coastal and other flood prone areas increases local governments may increase the requirements on new home builders for zoning approvals and restrict areas where new homes may be built resulting in increased development 

costs and greater competition for more desirable land parcels in addition as local governmental authorities and utilities are required to spend increasing amounts of their resources responding to and remediating weather and climate related events their ability to provide approvals and service to new housing communities may be impaired 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for the future development of our business and other capital needs without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2021 we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 18 billion as well as 7012 million available under our revolving credit facility revolving credit facility however our internal sources of liquidity and revolving credit facility may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity is our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds relating to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2021 we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2988 million and 18 billion respectively these letters of credit are generally issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our liquidity could be adversely affected 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2021 we had deferred tax assets of 1642 million against which we provided a valuation allowance of 252 million the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” and other tax attributes to offset our future taxable income or income tax would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols and other tax attributes we could utilize to offset our taxable income or income tax in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets to preserve our ability to utilize nols and other tax attributes in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities our shareholder rights plan as amended expires june 1 2022 unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 in addition our shareholder rights plan may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock because any nonexempt third party that acquires shares of our common stock in excess of the applicable threshold would suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest 

the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time they are realized a change in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would change the value of our deferred taxes which could be material 

our inability to sell mortgages into the secondary market could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes unless we are willing to become a longterm investor in loans we originate 

we sell substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate within a short period in the secondary mortgage market if we were unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to fannie mae and freddie mac we would have to either a curtail our origination of residential mortgage loans which among other things could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes or b commit our own funds to long term investments in mortgage loans which in addition to requiring us to deploy substantial amounts of our own funds could delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses arising out of claims associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan to date the significant majority of these claims made by investors against our mortgage operations relate to loans originated prior to 2009 during which time inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market we may also be asked to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex corporation centex which we acquired in 2009 for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations given the unsettled nature of these claims changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our business has been materially and adversely disrupted by the ongoing outbreak and worldwide spread of covid19 and could be materially and adversely disrupted by another epidemic or pandemic or similar public threat or fear of such an event and the measures that international federal state and local governments agencies law enforcement andor health authorities implement to address it 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak of covid19 as a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak and shortly thereafter many states and municipalities also declared public health emergencies along with these declarations extraordinary and wideranging actions were taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of covid19 in 

regions across the united states and the world including quarantines “shelterinplace” orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations 

those restrictions combined with a reduction in the availability capacity and efficiency of municipal and private services necessary to progress land development homebuilding mortgage loan originations and home sales which in each case varied by market depending on the scope of the restrictions local authorities have established tempered our sales pace and delayed home construction and deliveries the inconsistent and unpredictable impacts of the covid19 virus and the evolution of new variants with different characteristics impacting different areas of the country at different times throughout 2021 caused us to adjust our planning and operations at various times the cumulative effect of the covid19 pandemic on the global supply chain and our operations plus an increase in consumer demand contributed to delays in production in most of our markets through the date of this report 

while our operations are now fully functioning subject to regulated restrictions and safety constraints we have enacted in order to protect our employees trade contractors and customers the current resurgence of the covid pandemic in key areas of our operations has caused significant lost time due to isolations and any future quarantine may require us to reinstate restrictions on our operations despite the development of vaccines and more effective treatments for the physical impacts of covid19 there are no reliable estimates of how long the covid19 pandemic will last and therefore the unpredictability of the current economic and public health conditions will continue to evolve 

our business could also be negatively impacted over the mediumtolonger term if the disruptions related to covid19 decrease consumer confidence generally or with respect to purchasing a home cause civil unrest precipitate a prolonged economic downturn andor an extended rise in unemployment or tempering of wage growth any of which could lower demand for our products impair our ability to sell and build homes in a typical manner or at all generate revenues and cash flows andor access the capital or lending markets or significantly increase the costs of doing so as may be necessary to sustain our business further increase the costs or decrease the supply of building materials or the availability of subcontractors and other talent including as a result of infections or medically necessary or recommended selfquarantining or governmental mandates to direct production activities to support public health efforts andor result in our recognizing charges in future periods which may be material for inventory impairments or land option contract abandonments or both related to our current inventory assets the unprecedented uncertainty surrounding covid19 due to rapidly changing governmental directives public health challenges and progress macroeconomic consequences and market reactions thereto also makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to generate growth or achieve our objectives for 2022 and beyond 

any epidemic pandemic or similar serious public health issue and the measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address it could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period as a result the impact of such public health issues and the related governmental actions could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 

should the adverse impacts described above or others that are currently unknown occur or worsen in the future whether individually or collectively we would expect to experience among other things increases in the cancellation rates for homes in our backlog and decreases in our net orders homes delivered revenues and profitability such impacts could be material to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods we could also be forced to reduce our average selling prices in order to generate consumer demand or in reaction to competitive pressures in addition should the covid19 public health effort and governmental restrictions in response to the pandemic intensify to such an extent that we cannot operate in most or all of our served markets we could generate few or no orders and deliver few if any homes during the applicable period which could be prolonged along with a potential increase in cancellations of home purchase contracts if there are prolonged government restrictions on our business and our customers andor an extended economic recession we could be unable to produce revenues and cash flows sufficient to conduct our business meet the terms of our covenants and other requirements under our debt obligations andor mortgages and land contracts due to land sellers and other loans service our outstanding debt or pay any dividends to our stockholders such circumstances could among other things exhaust our available liquidity and ability to access liquidity sources andor trigger an acceleration to pay a significant portion or all of our thenoutstanding debt obligations which we may be unable to do 

general risk factors 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes usage errors by our employees or cyberattacks or errors by third party vendors who have access to our confidential data or that of our customers while to our knowledge we have not experienced a significant cyberattack we are continuously working to improve our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks to enhance our levels of protection to the extent possible against cyber risks and security breaches and monitor to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have an impact on our business there is no assurance that advances in computer capabilities new technologies methods or other developments will detect or prevent security breaches and safeguard access to proprietary or confidential information 

the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on companies has increased in recent years including significant ransomware attacks and foreign attacks on prominent companies and computer software programs if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly or if there are intrusions or failures of critical infrastructure such as the power grid or communications systems we could suffer extended interruptions in our operations any such disruption could damage our reputation result in lost customers lost revenue and market value declines lead to legal proceedings against us by affected third parties resulting in penalties or fines and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues in addition the costs of maintaining adequate protection and insurance against such threats as they develop in the future or as legal requirements related to data security increase could be material 

breaches of our computer or data systems including those operated by third parties on our behalf could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of our proprietary information or personal and confidential information about our employees customers and business partners requiring us to incur significant expense to address and resolve the misappropriation andor release of confidential information may also lead to legal or regulatory proceedings against us by affected individuals and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve depending on its nature a particular breach or series of breaches of our systems may result in the unauthorized use appropriation or loss of confidential or proprietary information on a onetime or continuing basis which may not be detected for a period of time 

negative publicity could negatively impact sales which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline 

our business strategy relies heavily on our reputation and brands which are critical to our success unfavorable media or investor and analyst reports related to our industry company brand marketing personnel operations business performance or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy furthermore the speed at which negative publicity is disseminated has increased dramatically through the use of electronic communication including social media outlets websites and other digital platforms our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes which would adversely affect our business 

in addition we can be affected by poor relations with the residents of communities we develop because efforts made by us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities or in connection with the transition of a homeowners association could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation in addition we could decide or be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our operating employees could negatively affect our business 

our success depends upon the skills experience and active participation of our senior management many of whom have been with the company for a significant number of years if we were to lose members of our senior management we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our operations could be negatively affected also the loss of a 

significant number of operating employees in key roles or geographies where we are not able to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of intangible assets may occur

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we experienced strong demand for our products throughout 2021 as new orders increased 8 in units and 28 in dollars over the prior year new order growth was uneven through the year as 2021 volume reflected our traditional seasonal patterns of higher orders in the first half of the year as part of the spring selling season while 2020 experienced significant volatility resulting from the onset of the covid19 pandemic which severely impacted sales in the first half of 2020 but then contributed to a sharp increase in demand in the second half of 2020 the favorable demand for new housing has been driven by mortgage interest rates near historical lows a limited supply of new and existing home inventory an increased appeal for homeownership and singlefamily living and a desire among some buyers to exit more densely populated urban centers or to relocate from higher cost geographical regions 

home closings increased 17 in 2021 compared with the prior year the higher closing volume occurred in the face of significant disruption in the homebuilding supply chain including the availability of certain materials and construction labor combined with delays in municipal approvals and inspections which has elongated the production cycle of the homes we are constructing while we are working with our supply partners have increased our speculative housing starts and have hired additional construction and customer service employees our production cycle times have extended in substantially all of our markets due to the challenges referenced above due to these supply chain challenges we are moderating lot releases and the pace of new orders in the majority of our communities in order to balance sales volume and production capacity to reduce backlog durations we believe these conditions will continue to impact our industry for at least the next few quarters 

we are also facing cost pressures related to labor and materials due in large part to a shortage of workers and supply chain challenges resulting from ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors specifically the cost of lumber more than quadrupled from mid2020 to mid2021 while the cost of lumber declined significantly since peaking in may 2021 it increased again in late 2021 and remains elevated compared to historical norms additionally the availability of certain wood products including roof and floor trusses and oriented strand boards remains challenged we also continue to experience significant challenges with the cost and availability of windows siding and appliances among other supply categories to date we have been and believe we will continue to be able to increase pricing to offset the majority of such cost increases due to ongoing high consumer demand 

despite the development of vaccines and more effective treatments for the physical impacts of covid19 there are no reliable estimates of how long the covid19 pandemic or its related impacts on overall economic conditions or the global supply chain will last as a result the unpredictability of the current economic and public health conditions will continue to evolve however all of our operations continue to function at effectively full capacity subject to health and safety protocols and we remain optimistic about future housing demand and our ability to continue expanding our business due to the higher demand and long municipal entitlement timelines the number of our average active communities declined 9 in 2021 compared to 2020 as we closedout communities at a pace faster than we were opening new ones in response we have increased our investments in land acquisition and development and we expect the number of our active communities to increase meaningfully in 2022 also while mortgage interest rates have recently increased they remain low relative to historical levels and supplies of new and existing home inventory remain low combined with an improving macroeconomic environment overall demand for new housing remained robust at the end of 2021 as evidenced by our significantly higher order backlog which increased 19 in units and 45 in dollars as of december 31 2021 over the prior year however future economic conditions and the demand for homes are subject to continued uncertainty due to many factors including the recent increase in mortgage interest rates higher inflation ongoing disruptions from supply chain challenges and labor shortages the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic and government directives and other factors while we believe the demand for new housing will remain strong through 2022 our past performance may not be indicative of future results 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding and financial services operations as of and for the fiscal years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2020 results compared to our fiscal 2019 results refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the sec on february 2 2021 

the following is a summary of our operating results by line of business 000s omitted except per share data 



• homebuilding income before income taxes increased 48 in 2021 primarily as the result of higher revenues and gross margins and improved overhead management homebuilding results also included insurance reserve reversals of 811 million and 934 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively partially offset by reserves against insurance receivables of 178 million in 2020 see note 11  and a goodwill impairment charge of 202 million in 2020 see note 1  

• financial services income before income taxes increased in 2021 compared with 2020 resulting from higher volumes partially offset by lower revenue per loan the prior year also included 264 million of mortgage repurchase reserve charges see note 11  

• our effective income tax rate was 225 and 186 for 2021 and 2020 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2020 resulted primarily from a benefit for federal energy efficient homes credits related to homes closed in prior years see note 8

a includes the amortization of capitalized interest 

b includes insurance reserve reversals of 811 million and 934 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively partially offset by reserves against insurance receivables of 178 million in 2020 see note 11  

c percentage not meaningful 

d see other expense net for a table summarizing significant items see note 1  

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2021 were higher than 2020 by 28 billion or 26 the increase was attributable to a 17 increase in closings combined with an 8 increase in average selling price the increase in closings was primarily the result of favorable demand conditions and occurred in substantially all of our geographic markets beginning in march 2020 the covid19 pandemic began to unfavorably impact the demand environment however demand improved significantly beginning in june 2020 and has remained favorable the higher average selling price reflects the impact of pricing actions taken in response to the higher demand as well as increased input costs partially offset by a small increase in the mix of firsttime buyer homes which typically carry a lower sales price 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 264 in 2021 compared with 243 in 2020 gross margins remained strong in both 2021 and 2020 relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors including strong consumer demand the low mortgage interest rate environment and limited supplies of new and existing housing inventory as a result the pricing environment remains strong which has allowed us to effectively manage pressure in house and land costs through pricing actions while costs remain elevated we have been able to more than offset these cost increases through price increases additionally while speculative home sales homes started prior to receipt of a customer order remain the minority of our operations the current environment is providing opportunities for additional pricing and relative margin gains related to such homes 

land sale and other revenues 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale and other revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales and other revenues contributed income of 265 million and 164 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively income in 2021 included a gain of 129 million related to a land sale transaction in california that had been in the entitlement process for a number of years 

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 90 and 96 in 2021 and 2020 respectively the dollar amount of our sga increased 1973 million or 20 in 2021 compared with 2020 this increase resulted primarily from higher sales commissions expense and other variable costs due to the higher production volume the improvement in sga as a percentage of home sale revenues is primarily attributable to leverage gained from the higher revenues this overhead leverage was partially offset in 2021 by higher headcount to support the increased production volume as well as higher performancebased compensation accruals due to the companys strong operating results these results also reflect insurance reserve reversals of 811 million and 934 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively partially offset by reserves against insurance receivables of 178 million in 2020 the 2020 sga expense also reflects severance costs of 103 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020 as we took actions to reduce overhead expenses due to the disruption caused by the early stages of the covid19 pandemic 

goodwill impairment 

as a result of the significant decline in equity market valuations that occurred during the period between our acquisition of innovative construction group icg in january 2020 and march 31 2020 we determined that an eventdriven goodwill impairment test was appropriate for the icg goodwill which resulted in an impairment totaling 202 million in the first quarter of 2020 this impairment was not the result of any unique factors specific to icgs operations but rather reflected the broadbased declines in the market capitalizations of publiclytraded construction companies in the short period of time between the acquisition and the march 31 2020 valuation date 

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities reflects our share of earnings from joint ventures and other investments with independent third parties and varies between periods based on the performance of the underlying investments 

net new orders 

net new orders in units increased 8 in 2021 compared with 2020 while net new orders in dollars increased by 28 compared with 2020 the net new order volume in 2021 reflects favorable demand conditions partially offset by a lower community count as more fully discussed above the annual cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period was a historicallylow 9 in 2021 compared to 14 in 2020 ending backlog dollars which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed increased 45 in 2021 compared with 2020 as the result of the higher new orders coupled with elongated cycle times due to supply chain delays for certain materials and labor and obtaining necessary approvals permits and inspections from local municipalities 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2021 and 2020 



the number of homes in production at december 31 2021 was 44 higher compared to december 31 2020 the increase in homes under production is the result of the significant increase in demand coupled with elongated cycle times due to supply chain delays for certain materials and labor and obtaining necessary approvals permits and inspections from local municipalities the higher level of unsold homes or speculative homes under construction reflects a strategic decision to increase our housing starts of speculative units in response to the noted supply chain challenges and to meet demand the lower unsold completed inventory is near historical lows for our company and reflects our ability to sell these speculative units given the strong demand environment 

controlled lots

while competition for wellpositioned land is robust we continue to pursue land investments that we believe can achieve appropriate riskadjusted returns on invested capital and have increased our controlled lot count as the result of the strong demand environment additionally we continue to seek to increase the percentage of our lots that are controlled via land option agreement such contracts enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option which reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 55 billion at december 31 2021

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following tables present selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  

a percentage not meaningful 



revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2021 increased 8 compared with 2020 the increase occurred as the result of increased homebuilding volumes partially offset by lower capture rates and margins per loan mortgage interest rates were at or near historically low levels during 2020 which resulted in a refinancing boom that created a very favorable competitive environment for new originations however the demand for refinancing within the mortgage industry waned in 2021 as mortgage interest rates began to rise which led to an increase in competition among lenders and lower margins per loan 

income before income taxes 

the increase in income before income taxes for 2021 as compared with 2020 was due primarily to higher volume partially offset by lower margins per loan additionally we incurred 264 million of mortgage repurchase reserve charges in 2020 see note 11  

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 225 and 186 for 2021 and 2020 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2020 resulted primarily from the extension of federal energy efficient home credits related to homes closed in prior years both 2021 and 2020 also included benefits related to the reversals of valuation allowances against state net operating loss carryforwards see note 8  

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings 

at december 31 2021 we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 18 billion restricted cash balances of 545 million and 7012 million available under our revolving credit facility we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a broad portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm deposits and investments our ratio of debttototal capitalization excluding our financial services debt was 213 at december 31 2021 

for the next twelve months we expect our principal demand for funds will be for the acquisition and development of land inventory construction of house inventory and operating expenses including our general and administrative expenses additionally we plan to continue our dividend payments and repurchases of common stock beyond the next twelve months we will need to repay or refinance our longterm debt the next tranche of which becomes due in 2026 

we believe that our current cash position and other available financing resources coupled with our ongoing operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business needs over the next twelve months and beyond to the extent the sources 

of capital described above are insufficient to meet our needs we may also conduct additional public offerings of our securities refinance debt dispose of certain assets to fund our operating activities or draw on existing or new debt facilities 

unsecured senior notes 

at december 31 2021 we had 20 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding with no repayments due until march 2026 when 5000 million of notes are scheduled to mature 

during 2021 we retired 4260 million of senior notes at their scheduled maturity date and also accelerated the retirement of 2000 million and 1000 million of our unsecured notes scheduled to mature in 2026 and 2027 respectively through a cash tender offer the tender offer resulted in a loss of 615 million which includes the writeoff of debt issuance costs unamortized discounts and premiums and transaction fees 

other notes payable 

certain of our local homebuilding operations are party to nonrecourse and limited recourse collateralized notes payable with third parties that totaled 402 million at december 31 2021 these notes have maturities ranging up to three years are secured by the applicable land positions to which they relate have no recourse to any other assets and are classified within notes payable 

revolving credit facility 

we maintain a revolving credit facility maturing in june 2023 that has a maximum borrowing capacity of 10 billion and contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the capacity to 15 billion subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility with a sublimit of 5000 million at december 31 2021 the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the london interbank offered rate libor or a base rate plus an applicable margin as defined therein in the event that libor is no longer widely available the agreement contemplates transitioning to an alternative widely available market rate agreeable between the parties as a precautionary measure during the initial phase of the covid19 pandemic we made the decision in march 2020 to draw 7000 million under the revolving credit facility in june 2020 we repaid the full outstanding balance of 7000 million we had no borrowings outstanding and 2988 million and 2497 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debttocapitalization ratio as each term is defined in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all covenants outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries our available and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit amounted to 7012 million and 7503 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

financial services debt 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the loans are sold in the secondary market which generally occurs within 30 days 

pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement with third party lenders the repurchase agreement that matures on july 28 2022 the maximum aggregate commitment was 6500 million during the seasonally high borrowing period from december 27 2021 through january 13 2022 at all other times the maximum aggregate commitment ranges from 4600 million to 5500 million the purpose of the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage including quantitative thresholds related to net worth net income and liquidity pulte mortgage had 6261 million and 4118 million outstanding under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and was in compliance with its covenants and requirements as of such dates 

dividends and share repurchase program 

we declared quarterly cash dividends totaling 1481 million and 1351 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively and repurchased 177 million and 45 million shares in 2021 and 2020 respectively for a total of 8973 million and 1707 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively on april 26 2021 our board of directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization of 10 billion at december 31 2021 we had remaining authorization to repurchase 4576 million of common shares this repurchase authorization was increased by 10 billion on january 31 2022 

contractual obligations 

we are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties these obligations impact our shortterm and longterm liquidity and capital resource needs certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 while others are considered future commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of longterm debt and related interest payments purchase obligations related to expected acquisitions and development of land operating leases and obligations under our various compensation and benefit plans 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2021 we had outstanding letters of credit of 2988 million our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 18 billion at december 31 2021 are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2021 these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 55 billion pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices at december 31 2021 outstanding deposits totaled 2544 million of which 200 million is refundable 

for further information regarding our primary obligations refer to note 5  debt and note 11  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on 10k for amounts outstanding as of december 31 2021 related to debt and commitments and contingencies respectively 

cash flows 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was 10 billion compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 18 billion in 2020 generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale each of which experiences seasonal fluctuations our positive cash flow from operations for 2021 was primarily due to our net income of 19 billion which was partially offset by a 13 billion increase in inventories which was primarily attributable to higher house inventory in production resulting from higher sales activity and extended production cycle times combined with higher investment in land inventory to support future growth cash flow from operations was also favorably impacted by 3953 million more in customer deposits resulting from the higher order backlog but unfavorably impacted by an increase of 3828 million in residential mortgage loans availableforsale resulting from higher loan originations to support revenue growth 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to our net income of 14 billion 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1241 million in 2021 compared with 1079 million in 2020 the 2021 cash outflows primarily reflect 1016 million of investments in unconsolidated entities primarily in support of our land development activities and capital expenditures of 728 million related to our ongoing investment in new communities and certain 

information technology applications the outflows were partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated entities of 539 million 

net cash used in investing activities in 2020 primarily reflected our acquisition of icg in january 2020 for 833 million as well as capital expenditures of 584 million 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 17 billion in 2021 compared with 2956 million during 2020 the net cash used in financing activities for 2021 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 177 million common shares for 8973 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 8369 million and cash dividends of 1478 million partially offset by net financial services borrowings of 2143 million 

net cash used in financing activities for 2020 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 45 million common shares for 1707 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 653 million and cash dividends of 1302 million 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year additionally given the disruption in economic activity caused by the covid19 pandemic our quarterly results in 2021 and 2020 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in the future 

supplemental guarantor financial information 

as of december 31 2021 pultegroup inc had outstanding 20 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes due at dates from march 2026 through february 2035 and no amounts outstanding on its revolving credit facility 

all of our unsecured senior notes and the revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain subsidiaries of pultegroup inc guarantors or guarantor subsidiaries each of the guarantor subsidiaries is 100 owned directly or indirectly by pultegroup inc our subsidiaries associated with our financial services operations and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the unsecured senior notes or the revolving credit facility collectively nonguarantor subsidiaries the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such guarantor the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt 

a court could void or subordinate any guarantor’s guarantee under the fraudulent conveyance laws if existing or future creditors of any such guarantor were successful in establishing that such guarantor 

a incurred the guarantee with the intent of hindering delaying or defrauding creditors or 

b received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for incurring the guarantee and in the case of and any one of the following is also true at the time thereof 

• such guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the incurrence of the guarantee 

• the incurrence of the guarantee left such guarantor with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on its business 

• such guarantor intended to or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature 

• such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment 

the measures of insolvency for purposes of determining whether a fraudulent conveyance occurred would vary depending upon the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and upon the valuation assumptions and methodology applied by the court however in general a court would deem a company insolvent if 

• the sum of its debts including contingent and unliquidated liabilities was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets 

• the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they become absolute and mature or 

• it could not pay its debts as they became due 

the guarantees of the senior notes contain a provision to limit each guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer however under recent case law this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise determined to be unenforceable if a court were to find that the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance the court could void the payment obligations under that guarantee could subordinate that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the guarantor or could require the holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred holders may not receive any repayment on the senior notes 

finally as a court of equity a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that 1 the holder of senior notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct 2 the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of senior notes and 3 equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code 

on the basis of historical financial information operating history and other factors we believe that each of the guarantors after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued was not insolvent did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature we cannot assure you however as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard 

the following tables present summarized financial information for pultegroup inc and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among pultegroup inc and the guarantor subsidiaries as well as their investment in and equity in earnings from the nonguarantor subsidiaries 000’s omitted 





critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the companys financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and the discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results requires management to make estimates and assumptions including estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties that affect the amounts reported as a result actual results could differ from these estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances we believe the following critical accounting estimates reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies refer to note 1  summary of significant account policies 

inventory and cost of revenues 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we test inventory for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the community may be less than its carrying amount such indicators include gross margins or sales paces significantly below expectations construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community and other known qualitative factors communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the community to its carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we determine the fair value of the community and impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices expected sales paces expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing the long life cycles of many communities and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

generally a community must have projected gross margin percentages in the midsingle digits or lower to potentially fail the undiscounted cash flow step and proceed to the fair value step our overall gross margin realized during 2021 and our average gross margin in backlog at december 31 2021 both exceeded 20 and we have only a small minority of communities with gross margins below 10 however in the event of an extended economic slowdown that leads to moderate or significant decreases in the price of new homes in certain geographic or buyer submarkets we could have a larger number of communities that begin to approach these levels such that more detailed impairment analyses would be necessary and the resulting impairments could be material additionally we have 4049 million of deposits and preacquisition costs at december 31 2021 related to option agreements to acquire additional land in the event of an extended economic slowdown we could elect to 

cancel a large portion of such land option agreements which would generally result in the writeoff of the related deposits and preacquisition costs 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing approximately 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 6271 million and 6418 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 70 and 68 of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 525 million to 725 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

volatility in both national and local housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims additionally ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs during 2021 and 2020 we reduced general liability reserves by 811 million and 934 million respectively as a result of changes in estimates resulting from actual claim experience observed being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections the changes in actuarial estimates were driven by changes in actual claims experience that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims these changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods which resulted in adjustments to the ibnr portion of our recorded liabilities there were no material adjustments to individual claims rather the adjustments reflect an overall lower level of losses related to construction defect claims in recent years as compared with our previous experience we attribute this favorable experience to a variety of factors including improved construction techniques rising home values and increased participation from our subcontractors in resolving claims 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates we utilize both fixedrate and variablerate debt for fixedrate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variablerate debt changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay our debt prior to maturity as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt 

the following table sets forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of december 31 2021 and 2020 000’s omitted 



a includes the pulte mortgage repurchase agreement there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at either december 31 2021 or 2020 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we generally enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 residential mortgage loans availableforsale had an aggregate fair value of 9471 million and 5650 million respectively at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of 3379 million and 3672 million respectively which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment unexpired forward contracts totaled 9030 million and 6864 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and whole loan investor commitments totaled 3100 million and 1696 million respectively at such dates hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments

homebuilding operations 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2020 we operated out of 874 active communities in 40 markets across 23 states we offer a broad product line to meet the needs of homebuyers in our targeted markets through our brands which include centex pulte homes del webb divosta homes john wieland homes and neighborhoods and american west we offer a wide variety of home designs at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to our major customer groups firsttime moveup and active adult during 2020 we delivered home closings totaling 24624 homes compared with 23232 homes in 2019 and 23107 homes in 2018 over our history we have delivered nearly 750000 homes 

we predominantly sell singlefamily detached homes which represented 85 of our home closings in 2020 2019 and 2018 the remaining units consist of attached homes such as townhomes condominiums and duplexes sales prices of home closings during 2020 ranged from approximately 150000 to over 2500000 with 92 falling within the range of 200000 to 750000 the average unit selling price in 2020 was 430000 compared with 427000 in 2019 and 425000 in 2018 

strategy 

we believe that national publiclytraded builders have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to access more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets control and entitle large land positions gain better access to scarce labor resources and achieve greater geographic and product diversification among our national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit from this scale and diversification in any market conditions our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

• drive operational gains and asset efficiency in support of high returns over the housing cycle 

• shorten the duration of our owned land pipeline to improve returns and reduce risks including targeting a longterm balance of approximately three years of supply each for owned and optioned land approximately six years of supply in total 

• maintain disciplined business practices to maximize returns on investment 

• increase scale within our existing markets by appropriately expanding market share among our primary buyer groups firsttime moveup and active adult 

• focus on buildingtoorder while maintaining an appropriate balance of speculative homes and 

• manage the companys capital consistent with our stated priorities invest in the business fund our dividend maintain a longterm debttocapital ratio within a targeted range of 300 to 400 and routinely return excess funds to shareholders through share repurchases 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to meet the needs of consumers we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option agreements which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements can serve to enhance our expected returns on our land investments and reduce the financial risk associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in certain of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development or if we determine that such parcels no longer fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is zoned and developed or is ready for development for our intended use where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and when needed local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2020 we controlled 180352 lots of which 91363 were owned and 88989 were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined homebuyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the needs of potential homebuyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each consumer group through our understanding of each consumer group we seek to provide homes that better meet the needs and wants of each homebuyer 

our homes targeted to firsttime homebuyers tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices and higher density moveup homebuyers tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we address the needs of active adults many of these active adult communities are agerestricted to homebuyers aged fiftyfive and over and are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including athletic facilities recreational centers and educational classes to facilitate the homebuyer maintaining an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than firsttime or moveup homebuyer communities during 2020 31 45 and 24 of our home closings were to firsttime moveup and active adult customers respectively which reflects a slight increase toward firsttime buyers since 2019 consistent with our continued investment in serving firsttime buyers 

we believe that we are an innovator in home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams supplemented by outside consultants follow a disciplined product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of house floor plans and elevations in each community including potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop fixture and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our 

customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

we market our homes to prospective homebuyers through internet listings and link placements mobile applications media advertising illustrated brochures and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays techenabled customers this includes our websites  wwwcentexcom wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom wwwdivostacom wwwamericanwesthomescom and wwwjwhomescom  which provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us 

our sales teams consist primarily of commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve independent thirdparty sales brokers our sales consultants are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process including selecting the community house floor plan and options that meet the customers needs we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which seeks to ensure that homebuyers are engaged and satisfied at every stage of the process fully furnished and landscaped model homes physically located in our communities which leverage the expertise of our interior designers are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have also introduced virtual reality walkthroughs of our house floor plans in certain communities to provide prospective homebuyers a more costeffective means to provide a realistic vision of our homes 

the majority of our homes are sold on a builttoorder basis where we do not begin construction of the home until we have a signed contract with a customer however we also build speculative spec homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete more effectively with existing homes available in the market especially for homebuyers that require a home within a short time frame we determine our spec home strategy for each community based on local market factors and maintain a level of spec home inventory based on our current and planned sales pace and construction cadence for the community 

our sales contracts with customers generally require payment of a deposit at the time of contract signing and sometimes additional deposits upon selection of certain options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts also typically include a financing contingency that provides customers with the right to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may also include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 68 billion 15158 units at december 31 2020 and 45 billion 10507 units at december 31 2019 for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2020 substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2021 though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of contract cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that establish a specific scope of work at an agreedupon price using a selective process we have aligned with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver quality throughout all aspects of the house construction process in addition our construction field managers and customer care associates interact with our homebuyers throughout the construction process and instruct homebuyers on postclosing home maintenance 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to build superior quality homes while maintaining efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and by following industry and companyspecific construction practices we maintain high quality product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

• common management of house plans to deliver house designs that customers value the most and that can be built at the highest quality and at an efficient cost 

• value engineering our house plans to optimize house designs in terms of material content and ease of construction while still providing a clear value to the customer 

• utilizing our proprietary construction standards and practices training of our field leadership and construction personnel communication with our suppliers and auditing our compliance through the use of both internal and third party construction experts and 

• working with our suppliers using a data driven collaborative method to reduce construction costs 

generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources however the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices national tariffs and other foreign trade factors additionally the ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices remains challenging as labor supply growth has not kept pace with construction demand to protect against changes in construction costs labor and materials costs are generally established prior to or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize costs we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future 

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 3 of us new home sales in 2020 in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rental housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year additionally given the disruption in economic activity caused by the covid19 pandemic our quarterly results in 2020 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved in the future 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees suppliers and subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate additionally we may experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay our anticipated development and construction activities in our communities 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating through a captive business model targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all of our loan production we originated the mortgage loans for 73 of the homes we closed in 2020 67 in 2019 and 62 in 2018 other home closings are settled via either cash which typically represent approximately 20 of home closings or third party lenders 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center for our mortgage operations that performs underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either indemnify the investor for potential future losses repurchase the loan from the investor or reimburse the investors actual losses 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

our insurance brokerage operations serve as a broker for home auto and other personal insurance policies in select markets to buyers of homes we sell all such insurance policies are placed with third party insurance carriers 

human capital resources 

the companys key human capital management objectives are to attract develop and retain top industry talent that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we build to support this goal the companys human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare for key roles and leadership positions for the future reward employees through competitive industry pay benefits and other programs instill the companys culture with a focus on diversity and ethical behavior and enhance our employees performance through investment in current technology tools and training to enable our employees to operate at a 

high level the companys commitment to the aforementioned goals is evidenced through its certification as a great place to work® and recent formation of a national diversity council 

at december 31 2020 we employed 5249 people of which 945 were employed in our financial services operations of our homebuilding employees 282 are involved in land acquisition and development functions 1752 are involved in construction and and postclosing customer care functions 1189 are involved in the sales function and 1081 are involved in procurement corporate and other functions our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors we consider our employee relations to be good 

we offer our employees a broad range of companypaid benefits and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry 

our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions we believe this provides longterm focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our executive area and divisional management teams the average tenure of our executive team and homebuilding area presidents is 20 years and the average tenure of our homebuilding division presidents is 15 years 

we are committed to hiring developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace our management teams are expected to exhibit and promote honest ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace all of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate ethical behavior 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our business has been materially and adversely disrupted by the present outbreak and worldwide spread of covid19 and could be materially and adversely disrupted by another epidemic or pandemic or similar public threat or fear of such an event and the measures that international federal state and local governments agencies law enforcement andor health authorities implement to address it 

an epidemic pandemic or similar serious public health issue and the measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address it could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period and thereby andor along with any associated economic andor social instability or distress have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak of covid19 as a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak and shortly thereafter many states and municipalities also declared public health emergencies along with these declarations extraordinary and wideranging actions were taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of covid19 in regions across the united states and the world including quarantines “shelterinplace” orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations for instance our business was impacted by restrictions on travel the inability to keep our sales centers open for inperson customer interactions limits on our ability to continue physical construction of homes and adjustments to many of our other business processes to limit direct interactions 

the severity of these restrictions and the extent of their impact on our operations has varied by market based upon the scope of shelter in place orders and public health conditions while all of the abovereferenced steps were necessary and appropriate in light of the covid19 pandemic they have impacted our ability to operate our business in its ordinary and traditional course those restrictions combined with a reduction in the availability capacity and efficiency of municipal and private services 

necessary to progress land development homebuilding mortgage loan originations and home sales which in each case varied by market depending on the scope of the restrictions local authorities have established tempered our sales pace and delayed home construction and deliveries the inconsistent pace of recovery from the cessation of normal activities in the second quarter of 2020 impacted our ability to start homes in that quarter which impacts our ability to advance production at typical paces in some markets through the date of this report 

while our operations are now fully functioning subject to regulated restrictions and safety constraints we have enacted in order to protect our employees trade contractors and customers the current resurgence of the covid pandemic in key areas of our operations may require us to implement restrictions on our operations the potential magnitude or duration of the business and economic impacts from the unprecedented public health effort to contain and combat the spread of covid19 are uncertain and could include among other things significant volatility in financial markets the covid19 public health effort may be intensified to such an extent that we will not be able to conduct any business operations in certain of our served markets or at all for an indefinite period in addition efforts by local governments and agencies to lift restrictions on individuals’ daily activities and businesses’ normal operations may result in a resurgence of a pandemic or epidemic like covid19 and potentially prolong and intensify the impact of the crisis despite the development of a vaccine and more effective treatments for the physical impacts of covid19 there are no reliable estimates of how long the covid19 pandemic will last and therefore the unpredictability of the current economic and public health conditions will continue to evolve 

our business has also been impacted by constraints to the labor and supply chain we rely on to construct our homes the continuing pandemic has caused our employees and those of our trade partners to miss workdays due to illness or quarantine in addition our supply chain has been impacted by similar labor interruptions slowing production capacity and by increased demand on raw materials generated in part by the covid pandemic the combination of these factors can lead to increased costs and reductions in our production times 

our business could also be negatively impacted over the mediumtolonger term if the disruptions related to covid19 decrease consumer confidence generally or with respect to purchasing a home cause civil unrest precipitate a prolonged economic downturn andor an extended rise in unemployment or tempering of wage growth any of which could lower demand for our products impair our ability to sell and build homes in a typical manner or at all generate revenues and cash flows andor access the capital or lending markets or significantly increase the costs of doing so as may be necessary to sustain our business increase the costs or decrease the supply of building materials or the availability of subcontractors and other talent including as a result of infections or medically necessary or recommended selfquarantining or governmental mandates to direct production activities to support public health efforts andor result in our recognizing charges in future periods which may be material for inventory impairments or land option contract abandonments or both related to our current inventory assets the unprecedented uncertainty surrounding covid19 due to rapidly changing governmental directives public health challenges and progress macroeconomic consequences and market reactions thereto also makes it more challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to generate growth or achieve our objectives for 2021 and beyond 

should the adverse impacts described above or others that are currently unknown occur whether individually or collectively we would expect to experience among other things increases in the cancellation rates for homes in our backlog and decreases in our net orders homes delivered revenues and profitability as we experienced in the first few weeks of our second quarter of 2020 such impacts could be material to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods we could also be forced to reduce our average selling prices in order to generate consumer demand or in reaction to competitive pressures in addition should the covid19 public health effort and governmental restrictions in response to the pandemic instensify to such an extent that we cannot operate in most or all of our served markets we could generate few or no orders and deliver few if any homes during the applicable period which could be prolonged along with a potential increase in cancellations of home purchase contracts if there are prolonged government restrictions on our business and our customers andor an extended economic recession we could be unable to produce revenues and cash flows sufficient to conduct our business meet the terms of our covenants and other requirements under our debt obligations andor mortgages and land contracts due to land sellers and other loans service our outstanding debt or pay any dividends to our stockholders such circumstances could among other things exhaust our available liquidity and ability to access liquidity sources andor trigger an acceleration to pay a significant portion or all of our thenoutstanding debt obligations which we may be unable to do 

while the economic impact of covid19 may be reduced by financial assistance under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act the consolidated appropriations act 2021 or other similar covid19 related federal and state programs such programs may not be sufficient to have a positive impact on our business 

risks associated with our industry 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and a deterioration in industry conditions or downward changes in general economic or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

for example beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy during this period we incurred significant losses including impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets and some aspects of the housing industry have yet to return to pre2007 production levels 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through pulte mortgage mortgage interest rates in recent years have been at or near historic lows thereby making new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs resulting from higher interest rates or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of our business for example during 2018 we experienced lower than expected conversions of traffic to signups especially among firsttime and moveup buyers beginning in may 2018 when mortgage rates increased 

the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans additionally the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes 

mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership both of which were historically generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes in december 2017 a law commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted while the tax act lowered the tax rates applicable to many businesses and individuals it also among other things i limits the federal deduction for mortgage interest so that it only applies to the first 750000 of a new mortgage as compared to 1 million under previous tax law ii introduced a 10000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes including real estate taxes and iii eliminated the federal deduction for interest on certain home equity loans the tax act also increased the standard deduction for individuals as a result fewer individuals are expected to itemize their income tax deductions which would reduce the income tax advantages associated with homeownership for those individuals any further changes in income tax law which eliminate or further reduce the income tax benefits associated with home ownership could have an adverse impact on our business 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which may have a negative impact on demand for our homes in an inflationary environment economic conditions and other market factors may make it difficult for us to raise home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which would reduce our profit margins although the rate of inflation has been historically low for the last several years we currently are experiencing increases in the prices of labor and certain materials above the general inflation rate 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build we experience significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

if the market value of our land drops significantly our profits could decrease and result in writedowns of the carrying values of land we own 

the market value of land can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating land option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss at times we have been required to record significant writedowns of the carrying value of our land inventory and we have elected not to exercise options to purchase land even though that required us to forfeit deposits and writeoff preacquisition costs for example we incurred landrelated charges totaling 203 million 271 million and 994 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively if market conditions were to deteriorate in the future we could again be required to record significant write downs to our land inventory which would decrease the asset values reflected on our balance sheet and materially and adversely affect our earnings and our stockholders equity 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices as well as government regulation such as governmentimposed tariffs or trade restrictions on supplies such as steel and lumber during 2020 and 2019 we experienced supply chain constraints increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor in some areas increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials cause increases in construction costs andor could cause construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction 

costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the us housing industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete for homebuyers in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building safety environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these assessments have increased over recent years as other funding mechanisms have decreased causing local governing authorities to seek greater contributions from homebuilders all of these factors can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in some cases to select and obtain building materials despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures in some cases subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials in such cases it can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes we record warranty and other reserves relating to the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built 

we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by us policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by us we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred 

but not yet reported our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves may not be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

we can be injured by improper acts of persons over whom we do not have control or by the attempt to impose liabilities or obligations of third parties on us 

although we expect all of our subcontractors employees officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws rules and regulations there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable laws regulations or governmental guidelines when we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations including practices relating to homes buildings or multifamily properties we build or finance we move to stop the noncomplying practices as soon as possible and we have taken disciplinary action regarding subcontractors and employees of ours who were aware of noncomplying practices and did not take steps to address them including in some instances terminating their employment however regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties and our reputation can be injured due to the practices having taken place 

the homes we sell are built by employees of subcontractors and other contract parties we do not have the ability to control what these contract parties pay their employees or subcontractors or the work rules they impose on their employees or subcontractors however various governmental agencies are trying to hold contract parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other workrelated laws by firms whose employees are performing contracted services governmental rulings or changes in state or local laws that make us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us in situations that are not within our control 

natural disasters severe weather conditions and changing climate patterns could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas for instance in 2019 and 2018 several hurricanes caused disruptions in our southeastern coastal markets but did not result in a material impact to our results of operations in addition while they also did not have a material impact on our business in 2020 or 2019 the increased prevalence of forest fires in our western markets have caused disruptions to our sales operations and development delays furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

government restrictions standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy transportation or raw material costs which could reduce our housing gross profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations for example as the risk of flooding in coastal and other flood prone areas increases local governments may increase the requirements on new home builders for zoning approvals and restrict areas where new homes may be built resulting in increased development costs and greater competition for more desirable land parcels in addition as local governmental authorities and utilities are required to spend increasing amounts of their resources responding to and remediating weather and climate related events their ability to provide approvals and service to new housing communities may be impaired 

risks related to our business model and capital structure 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for the future development of our business and other capital needs without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 26 billion as well as 7503 million available under our revolving credit facility revolving credit facility less any outstanding letters of credit issued under the terms of our credit facilities however our internal sources of liquidity and revolving credit facility may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds relating to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2020 we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2497 million and 15 billion respectively these letters of credit are generally issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our liquidity could be adversely affected 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2020 we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 1025 million against which we provided a valuation allowance of 698 million the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income or income tax would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income or income tax in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities our shareholder rights plan as amended expires june 1 2022 unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time they are realized a change in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would change the value of our deferred taxes which could be material 

our inability to sell mortgages into the secondary market could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes unless we are willing to become a longterm investor in loans we originate 

we sell substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate within a short period in the secondary mortgage market if we were unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to fannie mae and freddie mac we would have to either a curtail our origination of residential mortgage loans which among other things could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes or b commit our own funds to long term investments in mortgage loans which in addition to requiring us to deploy substantial amounts of our own funds could delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses arising out of claims associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan to date the significant majority of these claims made by investors against our mortgage operations relate to loans originated prior to 2009 during which inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market we may also be asked to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex corporation centex which we acquired in 2009 for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations given the unsettled nature of these claims changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

general risk factors 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes usage errors by our employees or cyberattacks or errors by third party vendors who have access to our confidential data or that of our customers while to our knowledge we have not experienced a significant cyberattack we are continuously working to improve our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks to enhance our levels of protection to the extent possible against cyber risks and security breaches and monitor to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have an impact on our business there is no assurance that advances in computer capabilities new technologies methods or other developments will detect or prevent security breaches and safeguard access to proprietary or confidential information the 

frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on companies has increased over the last year with significant ransomware attacks and foreign attacks on prominent computer software systems impacting a wide variety of companies and industries if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly or if there are intrusions or failures of critical infrastructure such as the power grid or communications systems we could suffer extended interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our employees homebuyers and business partners any such disruption could damage our reputation result in market value declines lead to legal proceedings against us by affected third parties resulting in penalties or fines and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

negative publicity could negatively impact sales which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline 

our business strategy relies heavily on our reputation and brands which are critical to our success unfavorable media or investor and analyst reports related to our industry company brand marketing personnel operations business performance or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy furthermore the speed at which negative publicity is disseminated has increased dramatically through the use of electronic communication including social media outlets websites and other digital platforms our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes which would adversely affect our business 

in addition we can be affected by poor relations with the residents of communities we develop because efforts made by us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities or in connection with the transition of a homeowners association could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation in addition we could decide or be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes which could adversely affect our results of operations 

the loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our operating employees could negatively affect our business 

our success depends upon the skills experience and active participation of our senior management many of whom have been with the company for a significant number of years if we were to lose members of our senior management we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our operations could be negatively affected also the loss of a significant number of operating employees in key roles or geographies where we are not able to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we experienced significant volatility in market conditions during 2020 we ended 2019 and began 2020 in an environment exhibiting strong demand conditions however on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic and the various containment and mitigation measures adopted by governments and institutions globally and in the us began to have a severe economic impact including causing the us to enter into an economic recession that continues through the date of this report 

in response to the covid19 pandemic and various state and local orders we instituted the following actions in march 

• placed restrictions on business travel for our employees 

• closed our sales centers model homes and design centers to the general public and shifted to appointmentonly interactions with our customers where permitted following recommended distancing and other health and safety protocols when meeting in person with a customer 

• enhanced our virtual sales tools to give customers the ability to shop for a new home online 

• closed the public gathering spaces of our amenity centers as well as community pools and athletic facilities 

• modified our corporate and division office functions in order to allow all of our employees to work remotely except for essential minimum basic operations which could only be done in an office setting 

• eliminated nonemergency warranty work in our customers’ homes 

• modified much of our customer interactions around the mortgage origination and closing process to be virtual and minimize inperson interactions and 

• modified our construction operations to enforce enhanced safety protocols around social distancing hygiene and health screening 

the severity of these restrictions and the date we resumed more normal operations have varied by market based on the reduction in restrictions under shelter in place orders and improvement in public health conditions while all of the abovereferenced steps were and some remain necessary and appropriate in light of the covid19 pandemic they impacted our ability to operate our business in its ordinary and traditional course however residential construction and financial services have been designated as essential services in almost all of our markets which has allowed us to continue operations 

as the result of the covid19 pandemic our net new orders declined significantly in late march through april as the pandemic spread and government and business responses expanded we focused on protecting our liquidity and closely managing our cash flows including through the following actions 

• delaying the acquisition of certain land parcels and slowing land development where practical 

• limiting our investment in house construction including strictly limiting production of new unsold speculative homes and contacting backlog customers to reconfirm status before beginning construction of sold homes 

• as a precautionary measure proactively drawing 7000 million under the revolving credit facility in march 

• suspending the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program and 

• reducing headcount and other overhead expenses 

however demand began to stabilize in may and then rebounded sharply in june and has remained strong through the date of this report this resulted in a 17 increase in net new orders for the full year 2020 over 2019 including a 24 increase in net new orders in the fourth quarter of 2020 over the fourth quarter of 2019 we believe the recovery in demand reflects a number of factors including historically low mortgage interest rates a limited supply of new and existing home inventory an increased appeal for homeownership and singlefamily living and a desire among some buyers to exit more densely populated urban centers in addition to the improved demand all of our operations are now functioning at effectively full capacity subject to health and safety protocols necessitated by the ongoing pandemic however we have experienced periodic disruptions in our supply chain including the availability of skilled labor as industry demand increases which have elongated the production cycles in certain markets we are also facing cost pressures related to labor and materials especially lumber although we believe that we will be able to increase pricing to offset the majority of such cost increases 

despite the volatility in 2020 the resurgence of demand resulted in the second highest annual pretax income and the highest yearend backlog as measured in dollars in our history these financial results combined with the favorable outlook have allowed us to 

• fully repay the 7000 million drawn on the revolving credit facility 

• reinstate our share repurchase program including the repurchase of 750 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2020 

• increase our quarterly dividend by 17 to 014 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 

• announce a tender offer expected to be completed in march 2021 for 300 million of our senior notes scheduled to mature in 2026 and 2027 

• increase our investments in new communities via land acquisition and development expenditures and 

• improve our available liquidity to 34 billion consisting of 26 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 7503 million available under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding and financial services operations as of and for the fiscal years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2019 results compared to our fiscal 2018 results refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 which was filed with the sec on january 30 2020 

the following is a summary of our operating results by line of business 000s omitted except per share data 



• homebuilding income before income taxes increased 25 in 2020 primarily as the result of higher revenues improved gross margins and strong overhead management homebuilding results also included a goodwill impairment charge of 202 million in 2020 see note 1  and net favorable insurancerelated adjustments totaling 757 million and 268 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively see note 11  

• the increase in financial services income in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily the result of the homebuilding volume growth an improved capture rate of homebuyers from our homebuilding operations and a low mortgage interest rate environment mortgage interest rates continued at or near historically low levels during 2020 which resulted in higher gains from the sale of mortgages in the secondary market these improvements were partially offset by 264 million of mortgage repurchase reserve charges see note 11  

• our effective tax rate was 186 and 241 for 2020 and 2019 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2020 resulted primarily from the extension of federal energy efficient home credits see note 8

the following is a summary of income before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



a includes the amortization of capitalized interest land inventory impairments of 70 million and 86 million in 2020 and 2019  respectively see note 2  and warranty charges of 148 million related to a closedout community in 2019 see note 11

c includes insurance reserve reversals of 934 million and 494 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively partially offset by reserves against insurance receivables of 178 million and 226 million 2020 and 2019 respectively see note 11  

d percentage not meaningful 

e see other expense net for a table summarizing significant items see note 1  

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2020 were higher than 2019 by 6642 million or 7 the increase was attributable to a 6 increase in closings combined with a 1 increase in average selling price the increase in closings was primarily the result of favorable demand conditions that began in 2019 and continued into the first quarter of 2020 especially among firsttime buyers which provided a large backlog of orders such that production could continue through 2020 despite the disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic the increased average selling price is reflective of favorable pricing actions related to all customer groups taken starting in the third quarter in response to the significant improvement in demand partially offset by the increase in the mix of firsttime buyer homes which typically carry a lower sales price 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 243 in 2020 compared with 231 in 2019 our results in 2020 and 2019 include the effect of the aforementioned land inventory impairments totaling 70 million and 86 million respectively excluding such impairments gross margins remained strong in both 2020 and 2019 relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors including shifts in community mix and the aforementioned warranty charge of 148 million in 2019 related to a closedout community in the southeast the low mortgage interest rate environment combined with limited supply of new and existing housing inventory has contributed to our ability to maintain or increase pricing in the majority of our markets which has allowed us to effectively manage pressure in house and land costs as well as expand margins amortized interest costs in 2020 remained roughly equal in dollar terms with 2019 but declined slightly as a percentage of revenue to 17 in 2020 compared with 18 in 2019 

land sale and other revenues 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale and other revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales and other revenues contributed income of 164 million and 67 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 96 and 105 in 2020 and 2019 respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased 329 million or 3 in 2020 compared with 2019 and reflects net favorable insurancerelated adjustments totaling 757 million 07 of revenues and 268 million 03 of revenues in 2020 and 2019 respectively these adjustments resulted from favorable insurance reserve adjustments partially offset by reserves against insurance receivables the lower gross sga dollars were partially offset by severance expense of 103 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020 related to various overhead actions taken as a result of the covid19 pandemic as well as higher incentive compensation expense 

goodwill impairment 

as a result of the significant decline in equity market valuations that occurred during the period between our acquisition of innovative construction group icg in january 2020 and march 31 2020 we determined that an eventdriven goodwill impairment test was appropriate for the icg goodwill which resulted in an impairment totaling 202 million in the first quarter of 2020 this impairment was not the result of any unique factors specific to icgs operations but rather reflected the broadbased declines in the market capitalizations of publiclytraded construction companies in the short period of time between the acquisition and the march 31 2020 valuation date 

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



the higher intangible assets amortization in 2020 reflects the icg acquisition in january 2020 the lower interest income in 2020 resulted from the lower interest rate environment while the higher interest expense reflects the aforementioned shortterm borrowing under the revolving credit facility 

net new orders 

net new orders in units increased 17 in 2020 compared with 2019 while net new orders in dollars increased by 21 compared with 2019 the increased new orders resulted from the strong demand for new housing during the year not withstanding the impact on demand in the second quarter of the covid19 pandemic which we attribute to a variety of factors including historically low mortgage interest rates a restricted supply of new and existing home inventory an increased appeal for homeownership and singlefamily living and a desire among some buyers to exit more densely populated urban centers while the annual cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period was flat in 2020 with 2019 at 14 the cancellation rate spiked in the period of midmarch through may as the result of the falloff in demand triggered by the onset of the covid19 pandemic before stabilizing and then declining ending the year with a cancellation rate of 12 in the fourth quarter 

due to supply chain challenges resulting from both disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic as well as the surge in demand we have consciously moderated the pace of sales in certain communities in order to better balance pricing sales pace lot availability and production capacity this has allowed us to increase pricing in the majority of our communities despite this moderation ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed increased 44 as measured in units and 50 as measured in dollars at december 31 2020 compared with december 31 2019 this represented the highest yearend backlog as measured in dollars in our history 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2020 and 2019 



the number of homes in production at december 31 2020 was 13 higher compared to december 31 2019 the increase in homes under production resulted primarily from the higher backlog since demand accelerated in june 2020 the new housing supply chain has experienced delays in regard to certain materials and labor as well as with obtaining necessary approvals permits and inspections from local municipalities as a result our production cycle times have elongated somewhat which has 

also contributed to the higher number of homes in production the number of unsold or speculative homes has decreased significantly as we have focused our production on completing sold homes consistent with the moderation of sales pace in certain communities discussed above 

controlled lots 

the following is a summary of our lots under control at december 31 2020 and 2019 



of our controlled lots 91363 and 93359 were owned and 88989 and 64903 were under land option agreements at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively while competition for wellpositioned land is robust we continue to pursue strategic land investments that we believe can achieve appropriate riskadjusted returns on invested capital the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 38 billion at december 31 2020 these land option agreements generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years our maximum exposure related to these land option agreements is generally limited to our deposits and preacquisition costs which totaled 2919 million of which 162 million is refundable at december 31 2020

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  



revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2020 increased 54 compared with 2019 the increase occurred primarily as the result of the homebuilding volume growth combined with the low mortgage interest rate environment mortgage interest rates continued at or near historically low levels during 2020 which resulted in higher gains from the sale of mortgages in the secondary market and also contributed to an improved capture rate 

income before income taxes 

the increase in income before income taxes for 2020 as compared with 2019 was due primarily to higher volume higher revenue per loan and improved expense leverage these improvements were partially offset by 264 million of mortgage repurchase reserve charges see note 11  

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 186 and 241 for 2020 and 2019 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2020 resulted primarily from the extension of federal energy efficient home credits see note 8  

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings

dividends 

our declared quarterly cash dividends totaled 1351 million and 1244 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

cash flows 

operating activities 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was 18 billion compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 11 billion in 2019 generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale each of which experiences seasonal fluctuations our positive cash flow from operations for 2020 was primarily due to our net income of 14 billion which included various noncash items including landrelated charges of 203 million and 1376 million of deferred income tax expense these factors were partially offset by a 567 million increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

our positive cash flow from operations for 2019 was primarily due to our net income of 10 billion which included noncash landrelated charges of 271 million and 1054 million of deferred income tax expense these factors were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 2377 million and a 483 million increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1079 million in 2020 compared with 2247 million in 2019 the 2020 cash outflows primarily reflect our acquisition of icg in january 2020 for 833 million as well as capital expenditures of 584 million related to our ongoing investment in new communities and certain information technology applications the use of cash in investing activities in 2019 was primarily due to our acquisition of american west in april 2019 for 1637 million as well as 581 million of capital expenditures 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 2956 million in 2020 compared with 7336 million during 2019 the net cash used in financing activities for 2020 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 45 million common shares for 1707 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 653 million and cash dividends of 1302 million 

net cash used in financing activities for 2019 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 84 million common shares for 2743 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 3100 million and cash dividends of 1224 million 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year additionally given the 

disruption in economic activity caused by the covid19 pandemic our quarterly results in 2020 are not necessarily indicative 

of results that may be achieved in the future 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 

  

a represents principal and interest payments related to our senior notes and limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements 

b we do not have any payments due in connection with capital lease or longterm purchase obligations 

we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2016 to 2020 at december 31 2020 we had 309 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 28 million of related accrued interest and penalties which are excluded from the above table 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2020 we had 2919 million of deposits and preacquisition costs of which 162 million is refundable relating to option agreements to acquire 88989 lots with a remaining purchase price of 38 billion we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next three years 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2020 



a the 10 billion in 20222023 represents the capacity of our revolving credit facility under which no borrowings were outstanding and 2497 million of letters of credit were issued at december 31 2020 

b represents the capacity of the repurchase agreement of which 4118 million was outstanding at december 31 2020 the capacity of 4200 million was effective through january 15 2021 after which it ranges from 2300 million to 3750 million until its expiration in july 2021 

c the above table excludes an aggregate 15 billion of surety bonds which typically do not have stated expiration dates 

supplemental guarantor financial information 

as of december 31 2020 pultegroup inc had outstanding 27 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes due at dates from march 2021 through february 2035 and no amounts outstanding on its revolving credit facility 

all of our unsecured senior notes and the revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain subsidiaries of pultegroup inc guarantors or guarantor subsidiaries each of the guarantor 

subsidiaries is 100 owned directly or indirectly by pultegroup inc our subsidiaries associated with our financial services operations and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the unsecured senior notes or the revolving credit facility collectively nonguarantor subsidiaries the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such guarantor the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt 

a court could void or subordinate any guarantor’s guarantee under the fraudulent conveyance laws if existing or future creditors of any such guarantor were successful in establishing that such guarantor 

a incurred the guarantee with the intent of hindering delaying or defrauding creditors or 

b received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for incurring the guarantee and in the case of and any one of the following is also true at the time thereof 

• such guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the incurrence of the guarantee 

• the incurrence of the guarantee left such guarantor with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on its business 

• such guarantor intended to or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature 

• such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment 

the measures of insolvency for purposes of determining whether a fraudulent conveyance occurred would vary depending upon the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and upon the valuation assumptions and methodology applied by the court however in general a court would deem a company insolvent if 

• the sum of its debts including contingent and unliquidated liabilities was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets 

• the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they become absolute and mature or 

• it could not pay its debts as they became due 

the guarantees of the senior notes contain a provision to limit each guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer however under recent case law this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise determined to be unenforceable if a court were to find that the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance the court could void the payment obligations under that guarantee could subordinate that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the guarantor or could require the holders of the senior notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee in the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred you may not receive any repayment on the senior notes 

finally as a court of equity a bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that 1 the holder of senior notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct 2 the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of senior notes and 3 equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code 

on the basis of historical financial information operating history and other factors we believe that each of the guarantors after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued was not insolvent did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature we cannot assure you however as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard 

the following tables present summarized financial information for pultegroup inc and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among pultegroup inc and the guarantor subsidiaries as well as their investment in and equity in earnings from the nonguarantor subsidiaries 000’s omitted 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2020 we had outstanding letters of credit of 2497 million our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 15 billion at december 31 2020 are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2020 these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 38 billion pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

home sale revenues   home sale revenues and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the home are transferred to the buyer at the home closing date little to no estimation is involved in recognizing such revenues 

land sale and other revenues   we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sales are generally outright sales of specified land parcels with cash consideration due on the closing date which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied revenues related to our construction services operations are generally recognized as materials are delivered and installation services are provided 

  

financial services revenues   loan origination fees commitment fees and direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment the determination of fair value for certain of these financial instruments requires the use of estimates and management judgment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned 

revenues associated with our title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur as each home is closed insurance brokerage commissions relate to commissions on home and other insurance policies placed with third party carriers through various agency channels our performance obligations for policy renewal commissions are considered satisfied upon issuance of the initial policy and related contract assets for estimated future renewal commissions are included in other assets and totaled 385 million at december 31 2020 due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the long duration of renewal policies which can extend years into the future actual results could differ from such estimates 

inventory and cost of revenues 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and closing costs applicable to the home sales commissions are classified within selling general and administrative expenses the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development 

costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we test inventory for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the community may be less than its carrying amount such indicators include gross margins or sales paces significantly below expectations construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community and other known qualitative factors communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the community to its carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we determine the fair value of the community and impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices expected sales paces expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing the long life cycles of many communities and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

generally a community must have projected gross margin percentages in the midsingle digits or lower to potentially fail the undiscounted cash flow step and proceed to the fair value step our overall gross margin realized during 2020 and our average gross margin in backlog at december 31 2020 both exceeded 20 and we have only a small minority of communities with gross margins below 10 however in the event of an extended economic slowdown that leads to moderate or significant decreases in the price of new homes in certain geographic or buyer submarkets we could have a larger number of communities that begin to approach these levels such that more detailed impairment analyses would be necessary and the resulting impairments could be material additionally we have 2919 million of deposits and preacquisition costs at december 31 2020 related to option agreements to acquire additional land in the event of an extended economic slowdown we could elect to cancel a large portion of such land option agreements which would generally result in the writeoff of the related deposits and preacquisition costs 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to and in limited instances exceeding 10 years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the projected cost of claims we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

income taxes 

we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence this evaluation considers among other factors historical operating results forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the outlooks for the us housing 

industry and broader economy the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 6418 million and 7098 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 68 of the total general liability reserves at both december 31 2020 and 2019 the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical thirdparty recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 550 million to 750 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

volatility in both national and local housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims additionally ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs during 2020 and 2019 we reduced general liability reserves by 934 million and 494 million respectively as a result of changes in estimates resulting from actual claim experience observed being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections the changes in actuarial estimates were driven by changes in actual claims experience that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims these changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods which resulted in adjustments to the ibnr portion of our recorded liabilities there were no material adjustments to individual claims rather the adjustments reflect an overall lower level of losses related to construction defect claims in recent years as compared with our previous experience we attribute this favorable experience to a variety of factors including improved construction techniques rising home values and increased participation from our subcontractors in resolving claims 

in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable our receivables from insurance carriers totaled 695 million and 1184 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the insurance receivables relate to costs incurred or to be incurred to perform corrective repairs settle claims with customers and other costs related to the continued progression of both known and anticipated future construction defect claims that we believe to be insured related to previously closed homes we believe collection of these insurance receivables is probable based on various factors including the legal merits of our positions after review by legal counsel favorable legal rulings received to date the credit quality of our carriers and our long history of collecting significant amounts of insurance reimbursements under similar insurance policies related to similar claims including significant amounts funded by the above carriers under different policies 

while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates we utilize both fixedrate and variablerate debt for fixedrate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variablerate debt changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay our debt prior to maturity as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt 

the following table sets forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of december 31 2020 and 2019 000’s omitted 



a includes the pulte mortgage repurchase agreement there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at either december 31 2020 or 2019 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we generally enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 residential mortgage loans availableforsale had an aggregate fair value of 5650 million and 5090 million respectively at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of 3672 million and 2553 million respectively which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment unexpired forward contracts totaled 6864 million and 5182 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and whole loan investor commitments totaled 1696 million and 2007 million respectively at such dates hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments 

special notes concerning forwardlooking statements

homebuilding operations 



for information and analysis of recent trends in our operations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2019  we operated out of 863 active communities in 42 markets across 23 states sales prices of unit closings during 2019 ranged from approximately 100000 to over 2300000  with 92 falling within the range of 200000 to 750000  the average unit selling price in 2019 was 427000  compared with 425000 in 2018  395000 in 2017  373000 in 2016  and 338000 in 2015  the increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors including favorable market conditions and changes in the geographical and product mix of homes sold our average unit selling price since 2015 was also impacted by our acquisition in january 2016 of substantially all of the assets of jw homes wieland a brand geared toward moveup homebuyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 85 in 2019 and 2018  compared with 88 in 2017  87 in 2016  and 86 in 2015  the decrease in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes since 2017 can be attributed to the geographic mix of homes sold and an increase in the number of our communities in more urban locations where higher density attached homes are more commonplace 

we believe that national publiclytraded builders have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to access more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets control and entitle large land positions gain better access to scarce labor resources and achieve greater geographic and product diversification among our national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit from this scale and diversification in any market conditions our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to meet the needs of consumers we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option agreements which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements can serve to reduce the financial risk associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in certain of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we also 

periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development or if we determine that they no longer fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is zoned and developed or is ready for development for our intended use where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and when needed local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2019  we controlled 158262 lots of which 93359 were owned and 64903 were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined homebuyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the needs of potential homebuyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each consumer group through our understanding of each consumer group we seek to provide homes that better meet the needs and wants of each homebuyer 

our homes targeted to firsttime homebuyers tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices or higher density moveup homebuyers tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we address the needs of active adults to whom we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for homebuyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area many of these active adult communities are agerestricted to the age fiftyfive and over homebuyer and are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to facilitate the homebuyer maintaining an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than firsttime or moveup homebuyer communities during 2019 29  45  and 26 of our home closings were to firsttime moveup and active adult customers respectively which reflects a slight increase toward firsttime buyers over 2018 consistent with our increased investment to serve firsttime buyers 

we believe that we are an innovator in home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams supplemented by outside consultants follow a 12step product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of house floor plans and elevations in each community including potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop fixture and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

we market our homes to prospective homebuyers through internet listings and link placements mobile applications media advertising illustrated brochures and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays techenabled customers this includes our websites  wwwcentexcom wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom wwwdivostacom wwwamericanwesthomescom and wwwjwhomescom  which provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us 

our sales teams consist primarily of commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve independent third party sales brokers our sales consultants are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process including selecting the community house floor plan and options that meet the customers needs we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which seeks to ensure that homebuyers are engaged and satisfied at every stage of the process fully furnished and landscaped model homes physically located in our communities which leverage the expertise of our interior designers are generally used to showcase 

our homes and their distinctive design features we have also introduced virtual reality walkthroughs of our house floor plans in certain communities to provide prospective homebuyers a more cost effective means to provide a realistic vision of our homes 

the majority of our homes are sold on a builttoorder basis where we do not begin construction of the home until we have a signed contract with a customer however we also build speculative spec homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete more effectively with existing homes available in the market especially for homebuyers that require a home within a short time frame we determine our spec home strategy for each community based on local market factors and maintain a level of spec home inventory based on our current and planned sales pace and construction cadence for the community 

our sales contracts with customers generally require payment of a deposit at the time of contract signing and sometimes additional deposits upon selection of certain options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts also typically include a financing contingency that provides customers with the right to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may also include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 45 billion  10507 units at december 31 2019 and 38 billion  8722 units at december 31 2018  for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2019  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2020  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of contract cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that establish a specific scope of work at an agreedupon price using a selective process we have aligned with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver quality throughout all aspects of the house construction process in addition our construction field managers and customer care associates interact with our homebuyers throughout the construction process and instruct homebuyers on postclosing home maintenance 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to build superior quality homes while maintaining efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and by using industry and companyspecific construction practices we are improving our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources however the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices national tariffs and other foreign trade factors additionally the ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices remains challenging as labor supply growth has not kept pace with construction demand to protect against changes in construction costs labor and materials costs are generally established prior to or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize costs we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future 

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 3 of us new home sales in 2019  in each of our local 

markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rental housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees suppliers and subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate additionally we may experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay our anticipated development and construction activities in our communities 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating through a captive business model targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all of our loan production we originated the mortgage loans for 67 of the homes we closed in 2019  62 in 2018  66 in 2017  and 65 in 2016 and 2015  other home closings are settled via either cash which typically represent approximately 20 of home closings or third party lenders 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center for our mortgage operations that performs underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment 

and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either indemnify the investor for potential future losses repurchase the loan from the investor or reimburse the investors actual losses 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

our insurance brokerage operations serve as a broker for home auto and other personal insurance policies in select markets to buyers of homes we sell all such insurance policies are placed with third party insurance carriers 

employees 

at december 31 2019  we employed 5245 people of which 897 were employed in our financial services operations our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors we consider our employee relations to be good 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and a deterioration in industry conditions or downward changes in general economic or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy during this period we incurred significant losses including impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets since 2011 overall industry new home sales have increased and we returned to profitability beginning in 2012 however the recovery in housing demand has been slow by historical standards and the adjustments we have made to our operating strategy may not be successful if the current housing market were to deteriorate significantly 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through pulte mortgage mortgage interest rates in recent years have been at or near historic lows thereby making new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs resulting from higher interest rates or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of our business for example during 2018 we experienced lower than expected conversions of traffic to signups especially among firsttime and moveup buyers beginning in may 2018 when mortgage rates increased 

the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans additionally the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes 

mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership both of which were historically generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes in december 2017 a law commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted while the tax act lowers the tax rates applicable to many businesses and individuals it also among other things i limits the federal deduction for mortgage interest so that it only applies to the first 750000 of a new mortgage as compared to 1 million under previous tax law ii introduced a 10000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes including real estate taxes and iii eliminated the federal deduction for interest on certain home equity loans the tax act also increased the standard deduction for individuals as a result fewer individuals are expected to itemize their income tax deductions which would mitigate the income tax advantages associated with homeownership for those individuals the combination of these changes could reduce home ownership affordability and demand especially in regions with higher housing prices or higher state and local income taxes any further changes in income tax law which eliminates or reduces the income tax benefits associated with home ownership could have an adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build we experience significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices as well as government regulation such as governmentimposed tariffs or trade restrictions on supplies such as steel and lumber during 2019 we experienced increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor in some areas increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials cause increases in construction costs andor could cause construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

if the market value of our land drops significantly our profits could decrease and result in writedowns of the carrying values of land we own 

the market value of land can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating land option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss at times we have been required to record significant writedowns of the carrying value of our land inventory and we have elected not to exercise options to purchase land even though that required us to forfeit deposits and writeoff preacquisition costs for example we incurred landrelated charges totaling 271 million  994 million  1919 million in 2019  2018  2017  respectively although we have taken efforts to reduce our exposure to costs of that type a certain amount of exposure is inherent in the homebuilding business if market conditions were to deteriorate in the future we could again be required to record significant write downs to our land inventory which would decrease the asset values reflected on our balance sheet and materially and adversely affect our earnings and our stockholders equity 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses arising out of claims associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan to date the significant majority of these claims made by investors against our mortgage operations relate to loans originated prior to 2009 during which inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex corporation centex which we acquired in 2009 for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties as of december 31 2019 our mortgage subsidiaries were defendants in legal proceedings in which the plaintiffs are seeking indemnification for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made by the mortgage subsidiaries in the mortgage loan sale agreements and may also be subject to other similar claims for which legal proceedings had not been instituted as of december 31 2019 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations given the unsettled litigation changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

our inability to sell mortgages into the secondary market could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes unless we are willing to become a longterm investor in loans we originate 

we sell substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate within a short period in the secondary mortgage market if we were unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to fannie mae and freddie mac we would have to either a curtail our origination of residential mortgage loans which among other things could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes or b commit our own funds to long term investments in mortgage loans which in addition to requiring us to deploy substantial amounts of our own funds could delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for the future development of our business and other capital needs without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2019  we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 13 billion as well as 7372 million available under our revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit however our internal sources of liquidity and revolving credit facility may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds relating to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2019  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2628 million and 14 billion  respectively these letters of credit are generally issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our liquidity could be adversely affected 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the us housing industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete for homebuyers in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

the loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our operating employees could negatively affect our business 

our success depends upon the skills experience and active participation of our senior management many of whom have been with the company for a significant number of years if we were to lose members of our senior management we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our operations could be negatively affected also the loss of a significant number of operating employees in key roles or geographies where we are not able to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax 

reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2019  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 2541 million  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 840 million  the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income or income tax would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income or income tax in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities our shareholder rights plan as amended expires june 1 2022 unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building safety environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these assessments have increased over recent years as other funding mechanisms have decreased causing local governing authorities to seek greater contributions from homebuilders all of these factors can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available 

these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in some cases to select and obtain building materials despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures in some cases subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials if defective materials are used it can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes we record warranty and other reserves relating to the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built 

we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by us policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by us we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters severe weather conditions and changing climate patterns could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected in 2019 and 2018 several hurricanes caused disruptions in our south eastern coastal markets but did not result in a material impact to our results of operations in addition while they also did not have a material impact on our business in 2019 the increased prevalence of forest fires in our western markets have caused disruptions to our sales operations and development delays as local governmental authorities and utilities are required to spend increasing amounts of their resources responding to and remediating weather and climate related events their ability to provide approvals and service to new housing communities may be impaired 

government restrictions standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy transportation or raw material costs which could reduce our housing gross profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations for example as the risk of flooding in coastal and other flood prone areas increases local governments may increase the requirements on new home builders for zoning approvals and restrict areas where new homes may be built resulting in increased development costs and greater competition for more desirable land parcels 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which may have a negative impact on demand for our homes in an inflationary environment economic conditions and other market factors may make it difficult for us to raise home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which would reduce our profit margins although the rate of inflation has been historically low for the last several years we currently are experiencing increases in the prices of labor and certain materials above the general inflation rate 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees or cyberattacks or errors by third party vendors who have access to our confidential data or that of our customers while we are continuously working to improve our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks to enhance our levels of protection to the extent possible against cyber risks and security breaches and monitor to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have an impact on our business there is no assurance that advances in computer capabilities new technologies methods or other developments will detect or prevent security breaches and safeguard access to proprietary or confidential information if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly or if there are intrusions or failures of critical infrastructure such as the power grid or communications systems we could suffer extended interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our employees homebuyers and business partners any such disruption could damage our reputation result in market value declines lead to legal proceedings against us by affected third parties resulting in penalties or fines and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

we can be injured by improper acts of persons over whom we do not have control or by the attempt to impose liabilities or obligations of third parties on us 

although we expect all of our subcontractors employees officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws rules and regulations there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable laws regulations or governmental guidelines when we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations including practices relating to homes buildings or multifamily rental properties we build or finance we move actively to stop the noncomplying practices as soon as possible and we have taken disciplinary action regarding subcontractors and employees of ours who were aware of noncomplying practices and did not take steps to address them including in some instances terminating their employment however regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties and our reputation can be injured due to the practices having taken place 

the homes we sell are built by employees of subcontractors and other contract parties we do not have the ability to control what these contract parties pay their employees or subcontractors or the work rules they impose on their employees or subcontractors however various governmental agencies are trying to hold contract parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other workrelated laws by firms whose employees are performing contracted services governmental rulings or changes in state or local laws that make us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us in situations that are not within our control 

negative publicity could negatively impact sales which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline 

our business strategy relies heavily on our reputation and brands which are critical to our success unfavorable media or investor and analyst reports related to our industry company brand marketing personnel operations business performance or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy furthermore the speed at which negative publicity is disseminated has increased dramatically through the use of electronic communication including social media outlets websites and other digital platforms our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment adverse publicity or negative 

commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes which would adversely affect our business 

in addition we can be affected by poor relations with the residents of communities we develop because efforts made by us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities or in connection with the transition of a homeowners association could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect sales or our reputation in addition we could decide or be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes which could adversely affect our results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

favorable demographic and economic conditions combined with the recently improving affordability of housing have supported the ongoing recovery in us new home sales that began in 2012 in recent years we have made significant investments to acquire and develop land inventory and open new communities we have grown our investment in the business in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects and working to shorten our years of owned land supply including increasing the use of land option agreements which now account for 41 of our controlled lots as compared with 11 at the beginning of 2012 we have also focused our land investments on closerin locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately moderates we have accepted the tradeoff of having to pay more for certain land positions where we can be more confident in future performance the combination of favorable demand conditions our investments in new communities strategic pricing and construction efficiencies resulted in growth in our revenues each year during the period from 2012 to 2019 

we entered 2019 in the midst of an industrywide softening in demand that began in mid2018 to varying degrees the slowdown occurred across all major buyer groups and substantially all of our geographies this slowdown was correlated with an increase in mortgage interest rates which contributed to ongoing affordability challenges confronting many prospective buyers as a result we entered 2019 with a smaller backlog than the year before however demand improved in mid2019 as we experienced increased traffic to our communities and higher new order volume relative to the same period in 2018 the improvement continued through the remainder of 2019 especially among firsttime buyers in part due to improving affordability driven by increasing wages slower price appreciation and a decline in mortgage interest rates based on these favorable economic factors and our investments in new communities we were able to generate a 9 increase in new orders and a 20 increase in ending backlog in 2019 compared with 2018 while the slow start to 2019 resulted in our full year closings and home sale revenues each increasing only 1 over 2018 we still delivered higher earnings per share in 2019 compared with 2018 

we believe that the actions we have taken over the past few years to shorten the duration of our land inventory increase our use of land option agreements and drive daily execution of our business while maintaining a conservative financial position allow us to operate effectively in most economic conditions additionally our overall financial condition continues to support investing in the business while returning excess capital to shareholders including completion of the following capital activities in 2019 



the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding and financial services operations as of and for the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2018 results compared to our fiscal 2017 results refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018  which was filed with the sec on january 31 2019

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2019 were higher than 2018 by 973 million  or 1  the increase was attributable to a 1 increase in closings the increase in revenues is attributable to an improved demand environment in the majority of our markets starting in mid2019 substantially offset by lower revenues in our northern california division which reflects the completion or near completion of several highperforming communities combined with moderating demand in that market 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 231 in 2019  compared with 232 in 2018  our results in 2019 and 2018 include the effect of the aforementioned land inventory impairments totaling 86 million and 710 million  respectively excluding such impairments gross margins remained strong in both 2019 and 2018 relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors including shifts in community mix and the aforementioned warranty charge of 148 million in 2019 related to a closedout community in the southeast the pricing environment in many of our markets allowed us to effectively manage pressure in house and land costs though sales discounts have increased moderately in response to the affordability issues faced by homebuyers and our increased use of speculative inventory amortized interest costs increased in dollar terms but remained consistent with the prior year as a percentage of revenue at 18 

land sale and other revenues 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales contributed net gains of 67 million and 379 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively the gains in 2018 resulted primarily from two land sale transactions in california that contributed 264 million  

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 105 and 103 in 2019 and 2018  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga increased 323 million  or 3  in 2019 compared with 2018  the increase is primarily attributable to higher headcount as order volumes increased in the second half of 2019 increased information technology spend operating costs associated with the american west transaction higher model home costs and insurance receivable writeoffs of 226 million in 2019 in connection with policy settlement negotiations with certain of our carriers see note 11  

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



net new orders 

net new orders in units increased 9 in 2019 compared with 2018  the increase resulted from the higher number of active communities which increased 4 to 863 in 2019  and a strengthening market in the back half of 2019 net new orders in dollars increased by 10 compared with 2018  the increase is a result of improved demand which began in the second quarter of 2019 and continued through the remainder of the year especially among firsttime buyers in part due to improving affordability driven by increasing wages slower price appreciation and a decline in mortgage interest rates the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period remained stable in 2019 at 14  ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed increased 20 as measured in units and 18 as measured in dollars at december 31 2019 compared with december 31 2018  the increase is primarily attributable to increased demand relating to the continued strength in the housing market 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2019 and 2018  



the number of homes in production at december 31 2019 was 13 higher compared to december 31 2018  the increase in homes under production resulted primarily from the higher backlog 

controlled lots 

the following is a summary of our lots under control at december 31 2019 and 2018  



of our controlled lots 93359 and 89530 were owned and 64903 and 60047 were under land option agreements at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively while competition for wellpositioned land is robust we continue to pursue strategic land investments that we believe can achieve appropriate riskadjusted returns on invested capital the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 32 billion at december 31 2019  these land option agreements generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years our maximum exposure related to these land option agreements is generally limited to our deposits and preacquisition costs which totaled 2994 million  of which 110 million is refundable at december 31 2019  

homebuilding segment operations 

our homebuilding operations represent our core business homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of homebuyers in our targeted markets as of december 31 2019  we conducted our operations in 42 markets located throughout 23 states for reporting purposes our homebuilding operations are aggregated into six reportable segments 

  

we also have a reportable segment for our financial services operations which consist principally of mortgage banking and title operations the financial services segment operates generally in the same markets as the homebuilding segments 

the following table presents selected financial information for our reportable homebuilding segments 

  



the following tables present additional selected financial information for our reportable homebuilding segments 

  

the following table presents additional selected financial information for our reportable homebuilding segments 



 

northeast 

for 2019  northeast home sale revenues decreased 3 compared with 2018 due to a 7 decrease in closings partially offset by a 5 increase in average selling price reflecting lower results in the northeast corridor the increased income before income taxes resulted primarily from the 745 million of land charges taken in 2018 net new orders increased 3  which is attributable primarily to new england and midatlantic 

southeast 

for 2019  southeast home sale revenues decreased 4 compared with 2018 due to a 6 decrease in closings partially offset by a 2 increase in average selling price the decrease in closings and increase in average selling price occurred across substantially all of our markets income before income taxes decreased 13 primarily as a result of lower gross margin which stemmed partly from charges of 148 million related to estimated costs to complete repairs in a closedout community net new orders increased 3  which is attributable to a majority of our markets 

florida 

for 2019  florida home sale revenues increased 8 compared with 2018 due to a 6 increase in closings combined with a 2 increase in average selling price the increase in closings and average selling price were attributable to the majority of our markets the increased income before income taxes for 2019 resulted primarily from higher revenues and improved gross margin net new orders increased 10  which is attributable to all of our markets 

midwest 

for 2019  midwest home sale revenues decreased slightly compared with the prior year period due to a 4 decrease in closings partially offset by a 3 increase in the average selling price the decrease in closings occurred across the majority of our markets while the increase in average selling price occurred across the majority of our markets income before income taxes increased 3 primarily as a result of improved gross margins net new orders increased 2 across the majority of our markets 

texas 

for 2019  texas home sale revenues increased 7 compared with the prior year period due to an 8 increase in closings partially offset by a 1 decrease in the average selling price the increase in closings occurred in all of our markets except houston houston closings were impacted by the timing of new communities as overall demand remains strong income before income taxes increased slightly as a result of higher closings offset by lower margins compared to 2018 net new orders increased 14  which is attributable to all of our markets 

west 

for 2019  west home sale revenues decreased 2 compared with the prior year period due to a 3 decrease in the average selling price partially offset by a slight increase in closings the decreased revenues were concentrated in northern california which resulted from the completion or near completion of several high performing communities combined with moderating demand in that market income before income taxes decreased 25 primarily as the result of lower volumes and profitability in northern california in 2019 as well as two significant land sale gains totaling 264 million in 2018 net new orders increased by 18 in 2019 compared with 2018 with significant increases in las vegas which benefited from the american west acquisition in april 2019 and arizona 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  



revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2019 increase d 14 compared with 2018  the increase occurred primarily as the result of higher volumes which largely resulted from an improved capture rate and improved margin per loan interest rates generally declined during 2019 which led to a less competitive mortgage environment contributing to improved capture rate and higher gains from sales of mortgages 

income before income taxes 

the increase in income before income taxes for 2019 as compared with 2018 was due primarily to higher volume higher revenue per loan and improved expense leverage additionally 2018 included a 161 million increase in loan origination liabilities see note 11  

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 241 and 242 for 2019 and 2018  respectively each years rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income tax expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings 

at december 31 2019  we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 12 billion  restricted cash balances of 335 million  and 7372 million available under our revolving credit facility we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a broad portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm deposits and investments 

we retired outstanding debt totaling 3100 million and 828 million during 2019 and 2018  respectively our ratio of debttototal capitalization excluding our financial services debt was 336  which is within our targeted range of 300 to 400 at december 31 2019  

unsecured senior notes 

during 2019 we completed a tender offer to retire 2740 million of our unsecured senior notes maturing in 2021 at december 31 2019  we had 27 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding with no repayments due until march 2021 when 4260 million of notes are scheduled to mature 

other notes payable 

certain of our local homebuilding operations are party to nonrecourse and limited recourse collateralized notes payable with third parties that totaled 534 million at december 31 2019  these notes have maturities ranging up to three years are secured by the applicable land positions to which they relate have no recourse to any other assets and are classified within notes payable 

revolving credit facility 

in june 2018 we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement revolving credit facility which matures in june 2023  the revolving credit facility has a maximum borrowing capacity of 10 billion and contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the capacity to 15 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility with a sublimit of 5000 million at december 31 2019  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the london interbank offered rate libor or a base rate plus an applicable margin as defined therein we had no borrowings outstanding and 2628 million and 2394 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debttocapitalization ratio as each term is defined in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all covenants outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries our available and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit amounted to 7372 million and 7606 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the loans are sold in the secondary market which generally occurs within 30 days 

pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement with third party lenders in august 2019  pulte mortgage entered into an amended and restated repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” to extend the termination date to july 2020  the maximum aggregate commitment was 3750 million during the seasonally high borrowing period from december 26 2019 through january 13 2020  at all other times the maximum aggregate commitment ranges from 2200 million to 2700 million  the purpose of the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage including quantitative thresholds related to net worth net income and liquidity pulte mortgage had 3266 million and 3484 million outstanding under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2019  and 2018  respectively and was in compliance with its covenants and requirements as of such dates 

share repurchase program 

we repurchased 84 million  and 109 million shares in 2019 and 2018  respectively for a total of 2743 million and 2946 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively under this program in 2018 our board of directors authorized a 5000 million share repurchase program and approved an increase of 5000 million in may 2019 at december 31 2019  we had remaining authorization to repurchase 5255 million of common shares 

dividends 

our declared quarterly cash dividends totaled 1244 million and 1085 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

cash flows 

operating activities 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was 11 billion  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 14 billion in 2018  generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale our positive cash flow from operations for 2019 was primarily due to our net income of 10 billion  which included noncash landrelated charges of 271 million and 1054 million of deferred income tax expense these factors were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 2377 million and a 483 million increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

our positive cash flow from operations for 2018 was primarily due to our net income of 10 billion  which included noncash landrelated charges of 994 million and 3628 million of deferred income tax expense supplemented by a 1073 million reduction in residential mortgage loans availableforsale these factors were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 504 million resulting from higher levels of spec inventory 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2262 million in 2019  compared with 419 million in 2018  the 2019 cash outflows primarily reflect our acquisition of american west in april 2019 for 1637 million as well as 581 million related to our ongoing capital expenditures in new communities and information technology applications the use of cash from investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to 590 million of capital expenditures for new community openings combined with expenditures on information technology applications 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 7336 million in 2019 compared with 5803 million during 2018  the net cash used in financing activities for 2019 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 84 million common shares for 2743 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 3100 million  and cash dividends of 1224 million  

net cash used in financing activities for 2018 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 109 million common shares for 2946 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 828 million  cash dividends of 1040 million  and net repayments of 894 million under the repurchase agreement related to the aforementioned decrease in residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  

  

 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2019  we had 2994 million of deposits and preacquisition costs of which 110 million is refundable relating to option agreements to acquire 64903 lots with a remaining purchase price of 32 billion  we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next three years 

we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2015 to 2019  at december 31 2019  we had 403 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 65 million of related accrued interest and penalties 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2019  



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2019  we had outstanding letters of credit of 2628 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 14 billion at december 31 2019  

are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2019  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 32 billion  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

home sale revenues   home sale revenues and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the home are transferred to the buyer at the home closing date little to no estimation is involved in recognizing such revenues 

land sale revenues   we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sales are generally outright sales of specified land parcels with cash consideration due on the closing date which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied certain land sale contracts may contain unique terms that require management judgment in determining the appropriate revenue recognition but the impact of such transactions is generally immaterial 

  

financial services revenues   loan origination fees commitment fees and direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment the determination of fair value for certain of these financial instruments requires the use of estimates and management judgment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned 

revenues associated with our title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur as each home is closed insurance brokerage commissions relate to commissions on home and other insurance policies placed with third party carriers through various agency channels our performance obligations for policy renewal commissions are considered satisfied upon issuance of the initial policy and related contract assets for estimated future renewal commissions are included in other assets and totaled 351 million at december 31 2019  due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the long duration of renewal policies which can extend years into the future actual results could differ from such estimates 

inventory and cost of revenues 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and closing costs applicable to the home sales commissions are classified within selling general and administrative expenses the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we test inventory for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the community may be less than its carrying amount such indicators include gross margins or sales paces significantly below expectations construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community and other known qualitative factors communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the community to its carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we determine the fair value of the community and impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices expected sales paces expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing the long life cycles of many communities and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either indemnify the investor for potential future losses repurchase the loan from the investor or reimburse the investors actual losses estimating the required liability for these potential losses requires a significant level of management judgment given the unsettled litigation changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to and in limited instances exceeding 10 years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the projected cost of claims we periodically 

assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

income taxes 

we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence this evaluation considers among other factors historical operating results forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the outlooks for the us housing industry and broader economy the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 7098 million and 7370 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 68 and 65 of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 600 million to 800 million  while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

volatility in both national and local housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims additionally ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs during 2019 and 2018  we reduced general liability reserves by 494 million and 359 million  respectively as a result of changes in estimates resulting 

from actual claim experience observed being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections the changes in actuarial estimates were driven by changes in actual claims experience that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims these changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods which resulted in adjustments to the ibnr portion of our recorded liabilities 

in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable our receivables from insurance carriers totaled 1184 million and 1530 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the insurance receivables relate to costs incurred or to be incurred to perform corrective repairs settle claims with customers and other costs related to the continued progression of both known and anticipated future construction defect claims that we believe to be insured related to previously closed homes we believe collection of these insurance receivables is probable based on various factors including the legal merits of our positions after review by legal counsel favorable legal rulings received to date the credit quality of our carriers and our long history of collecting significant amounts of insurance reimbursements under similar insurance policies related to similar claims including significant amounts funded by the above carriers under different policies 

while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates we utilize both fixedrate and variablerate debt for fixedrate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variablerate debt changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay our debt prior to maturity as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt 

the following tables set forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of december 31 2019 and 2018 000’s omitted 



a includes the pulte mortgage repurchase agreement there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at either december 31 2019 or 2018  

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we generally enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  residential mortgage loans availableforsale had an aggregate fair value of 5090 million and 4614 million  respectively at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of 2553 million and 2850 million  respectively which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment unexpired forward contracts totaled 5182 million and 5110 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively and whole loan investor commitments totaled 2007 million and 1878 million  respectively at such dates hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments

homebuilding our core business which includes the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the us and the construction of housing on such land generated 98 of our consolidated revenues in each of 2018 2017 and 2016 we offer a broad product line to meet the needs of homebuyers in our targeted markets through our brands which include centex pulte homes del webb divosta homes and john wieland homes and neighborhoods we offer a wide variety of home designs including singlefamily detached townhouses condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to our major customer groups firsttime moveup and active adult over our history we have delivered nearly 725000 homes 

as of december 31 2018  we conducted our operations in 44 markets located throughout 24 states for reporting purposes our homebuilding operations are aggregated into six reportable segments 

  

we also have a reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists principally of mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations our financial services segment operates generally in the same geographic markets as our homebuilding segments

homebuilding operations 



for information and analysis of recent trends in our operations see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2018  we operated out of 815 active communities in 44 markets across 24 states sales prices of unit closings during 2018 ranged from approximately 100000 to over 2200000  with 91 falling within the range of 200000 to 750000  the average unit selling price in 2018 was 425000  compared with 395000 in 2017  373000 in 2016  338000 in 2015  and 329000 in 2014  the increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors including favorable market conditions a shift in our sales mix toward moveup homebuyers and changes in the geographical mix of homes sold our average unit selling price since 2015 was also impacted by our acquisition in january 2016 of substantially all of the assets of jw homes wieland a brand geared toward moveup homebuyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 85 in 2018  compared with 88 in 2017  87 in 2016  86 in 2015  and 86 in 2014  the decrease in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes in 2018 can be attributed to the geographic mix of homes sold and an increase in the number of our communities in more urban locations where higher density attached homes are more commonplace 

we believe that national publiclytraded builders have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to access more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets control and entitle large land positions gain better access to scarce labor resources and achieve greater geographic and product diversification among our national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit from this scale and diversification in any market conditions our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to meet the needs of consumers we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option agreements which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements can serve to reduce the financial risk associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in certain of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will 

not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development or if we determine that they do not fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is zoned and developed or is ready for development for our intended use where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and when needed local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2018  we controlled 149577 lots of which 89530 were owned and 60047 were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined homebuyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the needs of potential homebuyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each consumer group through our understanding of each consumer group we seek to provide homes that better meet the needs and wants of each homebuyer 

our homes targeted to firsttime homebuyers tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices or higher density moveup homebuyers tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we address the needs of active adults to whom we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for homebuyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area many of these active adult communities are agerestricted to the age fiftyfive and over homebuyer and are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to facilitate the homebuyer maintaining an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than firsttime or moveup homebuyer communities 

during 2018 28  47  and 25 of our home closings were to firsttime moveup and active adult customers respectively our sales mix has shifted slightly in recent years toward the moveup homebuyer where demand has been stronger however we have increased our investment in communities seeking to serve the firsttime buyer and expect this buyer group to become a larger component of our sales mix in the future 

we believe that we are an innovator in home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams supplemented by outside consultants follow a 12step product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of house floor plans and elevations in each community including potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop fixture and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

we market our homes to prospective homebuyers through internet listings and link placements mobile applications media advertising illustrated brochures and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays techenabled customers this includes our websites  wwwcentexcom wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom wwwdivostacom and wwwjwhomescom  which provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us 

our sales teams consist primarily of commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve independent third party sales brokers our sales consultants are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process 

including selecting the community house floor plan and options that meet the customers needs we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which seeks to ensure that homebuyers are comfortable at every stage of the process fully furnished and landscaped model homes physically located in our communities which leverage the expertise of our interior designers are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have also introduced virtual reality walkthroughs of our house floor plans in certain communities to provide prospective homebuyers a more cost effective means to provide a realistic vision of our homes 

the majority of our homes are sold on a builttoorder basis where we do not begin construction of the home until we have a signed contract with a customer however we also build speculative spec homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete more effectively with existing homes available in the market especially for homebuyers that require a home within a short time frame we determine our spec home strategy for each community based on local market factors and maintain a level of spec home inventory based on our current and planned sales pace and construction cadence for the community 

our sales contracts with customers generally require payment of a deposit at the time of contract signing and sometimes additional deposits upon selection of certain options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts also typically include a financing contingency that provides customers with the right to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may also include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 38 billion  8722 units at december 31 2018 and 40 billion  8996 units at december 31 2017  for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2018  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2019  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of contract cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that establish a specific scope of work at an agreedupon price using a selective process we have aligned with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver quality throughout all aspects of the house construction process in addition our construction field managers and customer care associates interact with our homebuyers throughout the construction process and instruct homebuyers on postclosing home maintenance 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to build superior quality homes while maintaining efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and by using industry and companyspecific construction practices we are improving our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources however the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices national tariffs and other foreign trade factors additionally the ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices remains challenging as labor supply growth has not kept pace with construction demand to protect against changes in construction costs labor and materials costs are generally established prior to or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize costs we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future 

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 4 of us new home sales in 2018  in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rental housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees suppliers and subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate additionally we may experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay our anticipated development and construction activities in our communities 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating through a captive business model targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all of our loan production we originated the mortgage loans of 62 of the homes we closed in 2018  66 in 2017  65 in 2016  65 in 2015  and 61 in 2014  other home closings are settled via either cash which typically represent approximately 20 of home closings or third party lenders 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center for our mortgage operations that performs underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either indemnify the investor for potential future losses repurchase the loan from the investor or reimburse the investors actual losses 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

our insurance brokerage operations serve as a broker for home auto and other personal insurance policies in select markets to buyers of homes we sell all such insurance policies are placed with third party insurance carriers 

employees 

at december 31 2018  we employed 5086 people of which 881 were employed in our financial services operations our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors we consider our employee relations to be good 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and a deterioration in industry conditions or downward changes in general economic or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a significant decrease in our revenues and earnings that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy during this period we incurred significant losses including impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets since 2011 overall industry new home sales have increased and we returned to profitability beginning in 2012 however the recovery in housing demand has been slow by historical standards and the adjustments we have made to our operating strategy may not be successful if the current housing market were to deteriorate significantly 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through pulte mortgage while mortgage interest rates in recent years have been at or near historic lows thereby making new homes more affordable mortgage loan interest rates have increased recently as the federal funds rate has been increased increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs resulting from higher interest rates or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of our business for example during 2018 we experienced lower than expected conversions of traffic to signups especially among firsttime and moveup buyers beginning in may 2018 when mortgage rates increased 

the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans additionally the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes 

mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership both of which were historically generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes on december 22 2017 a law commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted while the tax act lowers the tax rates applicable to many businesses and individuals it also among other things i limits the federal deduction for mortgage interest so that it only applies to the first 750000 of a new mortgage as compared to 1 million under previous tax law ii introduces a 10000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes including real estate taxes and iii eliminates the federal deduction for interest on certain home equity loans the tax act also increased the standard deduction for individuals as a result fewer individuals are expected to itemize their income tax deductions which would mitigate the income tax advantages associated with homeownership for those individuals the combination of these changes could reduce home 

ownership affordability and demand especially in regions with higher housing prices or higher state and local income taxes any further changes in income tax law which eliminates or reduces the income tax benefits associated with home ownership could have an adverse impact on our business 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build we experience significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices as well as government regulation such as governmentimposed tariffs or trade restrictions on supplies such as steel and lumber during 2018 we experienced increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor in some areas increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials cause increases in construction costs andor could cause construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease and result in writedowns of the carrying values of land we own 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating land option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss at times we have been required to record significant writedowns of the carrying value of our land inventory and we have elected not to exercise options to purchase land even though that required us to forfeit deposits and writeoff preacquisition costs for example we incurred landrelated charges totaling 994 million and 1919 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively although we have taken efforts to reduce our exposure to costs of that type a certain amount of exposure is inherent in the homebuilding business if market conditions were to deteriorate in the future we could again be required to record significant write downs to our land inventory which would decrease the asset values reflected on our balance sheet and materially and adversely affect our earnings and our stockholders equity 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses arising out of claims associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan to date the significant majority of these claims made by investors against our mortgage operations relate to loans originated prior to 2009 during which inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex corporation centex which we acquired in 2009 for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties as of december 31 2018 our mortgage subsidiaries were defendants in legal proceedings in which the plaintiffs are seeking indemnification for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made by the mortgage subsidiaries in the mortgage loan sale agreements and may also be subject to other similar claims for which legal proceedings had not been instituted as of december 31 2018 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations given the unsettled litigation changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

products supplied to us and work done by subcontractors can expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business 

we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in some cases to select and obtain building materials despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures in some cases subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials defective products widely used by the homebuilding industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes the cost of complying with our warranty obligations may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repairs from subcontractors materials suppliers and insurers 

we also can suffer damage to our reputation and may be exposed to possible liability if subcontractors fail to comply with applicable laws including laws involving actions or matters that are not within our control when we learn about possibly improper practices by subcontractors we attempt to cause the subcontractors to discontinue them and may terminate the use of such subcontractors however attempts at mitigation may not avoid claims against us relating to actions of or matters relating to our subcontractors 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for the future development of our business and other capital needs without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 11 billion as well as 7606 million available under our revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit however our internal sources of liquidity and revolving credit facility may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds relating to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2018  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2394 million and 13 billion  respectively these letters of credit are generally issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our liquidity could be adversely affected 

our inability to sell mortgages into the secondary market could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes unless we are willing to become a longterm investor in loans we originate 

we sell substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate within a short period in the secondary mortgage market if we were unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to fannie mae and freddie mac we would have to either a curtail our origination of residential mortgage loans which among other things could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes or b commit our own funds to long term investments in mortgage loans which in addition to requiring us to deploy substantial amounts of our own funds could delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the us housing industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable land financing raw materials skilled management and labor resources we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume competition can also affect our ability to procure suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or other terms 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing 

increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

the loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our operating employees could negatively affect our business 

our success depends upon the skills experience and active participation of our senior management many of whom have been with the company for a significant number of years if we were to lose members of our senior management we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our operations could be negatively affected also the loss of a significant number of operating employees in key roles or geographies where we are not able to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2018  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 3682 million  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 926 million  the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income or income tax would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income or income tax in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities our shareholder rights plan as amended expires june 1 2019 unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

our ability to use certain of centexs federal losses and credits is limited under section 382 of the irc we do not believe that the section 382 limitations will prevent us from utilizing these centex losses and credits we do believe that full utilization of certain state nol carryforwards will be limited due to section 382 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building safety environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these assessments have increased over recent years as other funding mechanisms have decreased causing local governing authorities to seek greater contributions from homebuilders all of these factors can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves relating to the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by us policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by us we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters severe weather conditions and changing climate patterns could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected in 2017 and 2018 several hurricanes caused disruptions in our florida carolinas and houston markets but did not result in a material impact to our results of operations 

in addition government restrictions standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy transportation or raw material costs which could reduce our housing gross profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which may have a negative impact on demand for our homes in an inflationary environment economic conditions and other market factors may make it difficult for us to raise home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which would reduce our profit margins although the rate of inflation has been historically low for the last several years we currently are experiencing increases in the prices of labor and materials above the general inflation rate

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

favorable demographic a nd economic conditions combined with historically low interest rates have supported the recovery in us new home sales that began in 2012 during this period we have made significant investments to acquire and develop land inventory and open new communities including opening approximately 250 new communities across our local markets in each of the last three years we have grown our investment in the business in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects and working to shorten our years of owned land supply including increasing the use of land option agreements which now account for 40 of our controlled lots as compared with 11 at the beginning of 2012 we have also focused our land investments on closerin locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately moderates we have accepted the tradeoff of having to pay more for certain land positions where we can be more confident in future performance the combination of favorable demand conditions our investments in new communities and our focus on gross margin performance through community location strategic pricing and construction efficiencies resulted in growth in our revenues and income before i ncome taxes each year during the period from 2012 to 2018 

we entered 2018 with a large backlog of new orders and demand conditions remained favorable through the early part of 2018 as evidenced by continued growth in new orders during the traditional spring selling season however this was followed by an industrywide softening in demand that began in the second quarter of 2018 to varying degrees the slowdown has occurred across all major buyer groups and all of our geographies this slowdown was closely correlated with the rise in mortgage interest rates that began in may 2018 however we believe that the broader cause is the affordability challenge that many prospective buyers continue to face which has created uncertainty in the industry regarding shortterm demand however many of the fundamentals supporting continued growth in demand includ ing a strong employment picture in the us high consumer confidence a supportive though slightly higher interest rate environment and a limited supply of new and existing homes remain favorable 

we believe that the actions we have taken over the past few years to shorten the duration of our land inventory increase our use of land option agreements and drive higher margins while maintaining a conservative financial position allow us to operate effectively in most economic conditions additionally our overall financial condition continues to support investing in the business while returning excess capital to shareholders if demand conditions accelerate we have the communities and lots available to meet that demand

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2018 were higher than 2017 by 15 billion  or 18  the increase was attributable to a 10 increase in closings and an 8 increase in the average selling price the increase in closings reflects the significant land investments we have made in recent years and the resulting growth in our active communities combined with the favorable buyer demand environment that continued into the spring of 2018 the higher average selling prices occurred across the majority of our markets and reflects shifts in product mix including a higher mix of moveup homebuyers and an increase in the mix of closings in northern california where our average selling prices are significantly higher than the company average 

home sale revenues for 2017 were higher than 2016 by 8727 million  or 12  the increase was attributable to a 6 increase in closings and a 6 increase in the average selling price the increase in closings reflects the significant land investments we have made in recent years and the resulting increase in our active communities combined with favorable buyer demand conditions the increased closings occurred despite the disruption in our operations caused by hurricane harvey in houston texas and hurricane irma in florida as well as permitting and other municipal approval delays in certain communities the higher average selling price for 2017 occurred across the majority of our markets and reflected a shift toward moveup homebuyers 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 232 in 2018  compared with 224 in 2017 and 250 in 2016  our results in 2018 and 2017 include the effect of the aforementioned land inventory impairments totaling 710 million and 890 million  respectively excluding such impairments gross margins remained strong in both 2018 and 2017 relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors including shifts in community mix and a small increase in the mix of closings in northern california in 2018 partially offset by the aforementioned warranty charge of 124 million in 2017 related to a closedout community in florida and slightly higher amortized interest costs  18 of home sale revenues in 2018 compared with 17 in 2017 gross margins decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 as the result of the aforementioned land inventory impairments and warranty charge combined with higher house construction and land costs as the supply chain responded to the housing recovery 

land sales 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales contributed net gains losses of 379 million  729 million  and 120 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the gains in 2018 resulted primarily from two land sale transactions in california that contributed 264 million  the losses in 2017 resulted primarily from the aforementioned net realizable value charges of 836 million see note 2  

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 103 and 107 in 2018 and 2017  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga increased 1204 million  or 14  in 2018 compared with 2017  the improved overhead leverage reflects volume efficiencies and realized cost efficiencies as well as the aforementioned insurance reserve reversals of 359 million and 978 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively partially offset by writeoffs of 296 million in 2017 associated with the resolution of certain insurance matters see note 11  

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 107 and 128 in 2017 and 2016  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased 656 million  or 7  in 2017 compared with 2016  sga includes the aforementioned insurance receivable writeoffs of 296 million in 2017 and general liability insurance reserve reversals of 978 million and 571 million in 2017 and 2016  respectively resulting from favorable claims experience see note 11  excluding these items the improvement in our yearoveryear sga leverage was primarily attributable to cost efficiencies realized in late 2016 that continued into 2017 

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



 

net new orders 

net new orders in units increased 1 in 2018 compared with 2017  the increase resulted primarily from the higher number of active communities which increased 3 to 815 at december 31 2018  net new orders in dollars increased by 3 compared with 2017 due to the growth in units combined with the higher average selling price the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period remained stable in 2018 at 14  ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed decreased 3 as measured in units and 4 as measured in dollars at december 31 2018 compared with december 31 2017  the higher average sales price when compared to 2017 also contributed to the higher backlog dollars our higher number of active communities combined with the overall demand environment resulted in a strong start to the year however while customer traffic to our communities increased during 2018 we experienced lower than expected conversions of traffic to signups especially among firsttime and moveup buyers beginning in may 2018 when mortgage rates increased which compounded existing housing affordability issues faced by many homebuyers 

net new orders in units increased 11 in 2017 compared with 2016  the increase resulted primarily from the higher number of active communities which increased 9 to 790 active communities at december 31 2017  net new orders in dollars increased by 21 compared with 2016 due to the growth in units combined with the higher average selling price the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period decreased in 2017 from 2016 at 14 and 15  respectively ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed increased 21 at december 31 2017 compared with december 31 2016 as measured in units and increased 35 over the prior year period as measured in dollars the higher average sales price when compared to 2016 also contributed to the higher backlog dollars 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2018 and 2017  



the number of homes in production at december 31 2018 was 7 higher compared to december 31 2017  the increase in homes under production resulted from a 24 increase in the number of unsold or spec homes which resulted primarily from the strategic decision to allow spec production to run higher than in previous periods to ensure access to construction suppliers and to position communities heading into 2019 ahead of the spring selling season 

controlled lots 

the following is a summary of our lots under control at december 31 2018 and 2017  



of our controlled lots 89530 and 89253 were owned and 60047 and 52156 were under land option agreements at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively while competition for wellpositioned land is robust we continue to pursue strategic land positions that drive appropriate returns on invested capital the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 26 billion at december 31 2018  these land option agreements generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years our maximum exposure related to these land option agreements is generally limited to our deposits and preacquisition costs which totaled 2186 million  of which 112 million is refundable at december 31 2018  

homebuilding segment operations 

our homebuilding operations represent our core business homebuilding offers a broad product line to meet the needs of homebuyers in our targeted markets as of december 31 2018  we conducted our operations in 44 markets located throughout 24 states for reporting purposes our homebuilding operations are aggregated into six reportable segments

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage banking title and insurance brokerage operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  



revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2018 increase d 7 compared with 2017  the increase is primarily due to higher loan origination title and insurance brokerage volume resulting from higher volumes in the homebuilding segment a higher average loan size driven primarily by higher average selling prices in the homebuilding segment also contributed to the higher revenues these factors were partially offset by the lower capture rate resulting from a more competitive market environment total financial services revenues during 2017 increase d 6 compared with 2016 due to higher mortgage and title volumes resulting from increased home closings in the homebuilding segment partially offset by lower mortgage revenue per loan which were largely attributable to increased competition and pressured loan pricing 

income before income taxes 

the decrease in income before income taxes for 2018 as compared with 2017 was primarily due to a 161 million increase in loan origination liabilities in 2018 see note 11  combined with a more competitive pricing environment refinance activity has slowed in the mortgage industry which has increased competition pressured loan pricing and resulted in lower margins on our loan originations in 2018 these factors offset higher revenues driven primarily by higher volumes in the homebuilding segment the increase d income before income taxes for 2017 as compared with 2016 resulted from higher origination volume and an increase in the revenue per loan combined with better overhead leverage and contributions from our title operations 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 242  524 and 355 for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the effective tax rates for 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of the tax act which lowered the federal tax rate from 35 to 21 effective in 2018 due to the tax acts enactment in december 2017 income tax expense for 2017 included a charge of 1721 million related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances and other effects the effective tax rate for 2016 included a net benefit related to the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance related to a legal entity restructuring along with the resolution of certain state income tax and other matters

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 was 14 billion  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 6631 million and 683 million in 2017 and 2016  respectively generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale our positive cash flow from operations for 2018 was primarily due to our net income of 10 billion  which included noncash landrelated charges of 994 million and 3628 million of deferred income tax expense supplemented by a 1073 million reduction in residential mortgage loans availableforsale these factors were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 504 million resulting from higher levels of spec inventory 

our positive cash flow from operations for 2017 was primarily due to our net income of 4472 million  which included 1919 million in noncash landrelated charges and deferred tax expense of 4223 million  these were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 5690 million resulting from ongoing land acquisition and development investment to support future growth combined with additional house inventory to support the higher backlog 

our negative cash flow from operations for 2016 was primarily due to a net increase in inventories of 8971 million resulting from increased land investment combined with a net increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale of 995 million  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 419 million in 2018  compared with 502 million in 2017 and 4712 million in 2016  the use of cash from investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to 590 million of capital expenditures which increased from 2017 as the result of new community openings combined with increased expenditures on information technology solutions the use of cash from investing activities in 2017 was primarily due to 321 million of capital expenditures and 230 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries the use of cash from investing activities in 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from wieland see note 1  

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5803 million in 2018  compared with 10 billion during 2017 and net cash provided by financing activities of 3507 million in 2016  the net cash used in financing activities for 2018 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 109 million common shares for 2946 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 828 million  cash dividends of 1040 million  and net repayments of 894 million under the repurchase agreement related to the aforementioned decrease in residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

net cash used in financing activities for 2017 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 354 million common shares for 9103 million under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 1347 million  and cash dividends of 1127 million  partially offset by net borrowings of 1062 million under the repurchase agreement related to a seasonal increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale cash provided by financing activities for 2016 resulted primarily from the proceeds of the unsecured senior notes issuance for 20 billion  offset by the repayment of 9869 million of debt and the repurchase of 309 million common shares for 6000 million under our repurchase authorization and cash dividends of 1247 million  

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  

  

 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2018  we had 2186 million of deposits and preacquisition costs of which 112 million is refundable relating to option agreements to acquire 60047 lots with a remaining purchase price of 26 billion  we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next three years 

we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years january 1 2005  january 1 2018  at december 31 2018  we had 306 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 58 million of related accrued interest and penalties 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2018  



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2018  we had outstanding letters of credit of 2394 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from 

the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 13 billion at december 31 2018  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2018  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 26 billion  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices 

at december 31 2018  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 429 million  of which 421 million was related to one joint venture in which we have a 50 interest in connection with this loan we and our joint venture partner provided customary limited recourse guaranties in which our maximum financial loss exposure is limited to our pro rata share of the debt outstanding see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

home sale revenues   home sale revenues and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the home are transferred to the buyer at the home closing date little to no estimation is involved in recognizing such revenues 

land sale revenues   we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sales are generally outright sales of specified land parcels with cash consideration due on the closing date which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied certain land sale contracts may contain unique terms that require management judgment in determining the appropriate revenue recognition but the impact of such transactions is generally immaterial 

  

financial services revenues   loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment the determination of fair value for certain of these financial instruments requires the use of estimates and management judgment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned 

revenues associated with our title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur as each home is closed insurance brokerage commissions relate to commissions on home and other insurance policies placed with third party carriers through various agency channels our performance obligations for policy renewal commissions are considered satisfied upon issuance of the initial policy and related contract assets for estimated future renewal commissions are included in other assets and totaled 308 million at december 31 2018  due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the long duration of renewal policies which can extend years into the future actual results could differ from such estimates 

inventory and cost of revenues 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and closing costs applicable to the home sales commissions are classified within selling general and administrative expenses the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development 

costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we test inventory for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the community may be less than its carrying amount such indicators include gross margins or sales paces significantly below expectations construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community and other known qualitative factors communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the community to its carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we determine the fair value of the community and impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing the long life cycles of many communities and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either indemnify the investor for potential future losses repurchase the loan from the investor or reimburse the investors actual losses estimating the required liability for these potential losses requires a significant level of management judgment given the unsettled litigation changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to and in limited instances exceeding 10 years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the projected cost of claims we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

income taxes 

we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence this evaluation considers among other factors historical operating results forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the outlooks for 

the us housing industry and broader economy the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including relevant facts and circumstances applicable tax law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 7370 million and 7588 million at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 65 of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2018 and 2017  the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 625 million to 850 million  while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims additionally ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs during 2018  2017  and 2016  we reduced general liability reserves by 359 million  978 million  and 571 million  respectively as a result of changes in estimates resulting from actual claim experience observed being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections the changes in actuarial estimates were driven by changes in actual claims experience that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims these changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods which resulted in adjustments to the ibnr portion of our recorded liabilities 

in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable our receivables from insurance carriers totaled 1530 million and 2134 million at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively the 

insurance receivables relate to costs incurred or to be incurred to perform corrective repairs settle claims with customers and other costs related to the continued progression of both known and anticipated future construction defect claims that we believe to be insured related to previously closed homes we believe collection of these insurance receivables is probable based on various factors including the legal merits of our positions after review by legal counsel favorable legal rulings received to date the credit quality of our carriers and our long history of collecting significant amounts of insurance reimbursements under similar insurance policies related to similar claims including significant amounts funded by the above carriers under different policies 

while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates we utilize both fixedrate and variablerate debt for fixedrate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variablerate debt changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay our debt prior to maturity as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt 

the following tables set forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of december 31 2018 and 2017 000’s omitted 



a includes the pulte mortgage repurchase agreement there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at either december 31 2018 or 2017  

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we generally enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

at december 31 2018 and 2017  residential mortgage loans availableforsale had an aggregate fair value of 4614 million and 5706 million  respectively at december 31 2018 and 2017  we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of 2850 million and 2109 million  respectively which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment unexpired forward contracts totaled 5110 million and 5220 million at december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively and whole loan investor commitments totaled 1878 million and 2031 million  respectively at such dates hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments 

special notes concerning forwardlooking statements 

as a cautionary note except for the historical information contained herein certain matters discussed in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  are “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 such forwardlooking statements are subject to a number of risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results performance prospects or opportunities as well as those of the markets we serve or intend to serve to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate to matters of a strictly factual or historical nature and generally discuss or relate to forecasts estimates or other expectations regarding future events generally the words “believe” “expect” “intend” “estimate” “anticipate” “plan” “project” “may” “can” “could” “might” should “will” and similar expressions identify forwardlooking statements including statements related to the impairment charge with respect to certain land parcels and the impacts or effects thereof expected operating and performing results planned transactions planned objectives of management future developments or conditions in the industries in which we participate and other trends developments and uncertainties that may affect our business in the future

homebuilding operations 



after several years of declining sales volume new home sales in the us increased in 2012 for the first time since 2005 beginning a multiyear recovery in demand this trend continued in 2017 as new home sales in the us rose 8  over 2016 to approximately 608000  homes approximately double the number from 2011 the bottom of the most recent housing downturn additionally mortgage interest rates remain near historic lows and the overall inventory of homes available for sale especially new homes remains low although the recovery in housing demand has been slow by historical standards the improved demand environment and actions we have taken to improve business performance have contributed to significant increases in our income before income taxes for the period 2013  2017 we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to access more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets control and entitle large land positions gain better access to scarce labor resources and achieve greater geographic and product diversification among our national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions continue to recover in the shortterm we expect that overall market conditions will continue to improve but that improvements will occur unevenly across our markets our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2017  we had 790  active communities spanning 47  markets across 25  states sales prices of unit closings during 2017  ranged from approximately 100000  to over 2000000  with 90  falling within the range of 200000  to 750000  the average unit selling price in 2017  was 395000  compared with 373000  in 2016  338000  in 2015  329000  in 2014  and 305000  in 2013  the increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors including favorable market conditions a shift in our sales mix toward moveup homebuyers and changes in the geographical mix of homes sold our average unit selling price in 2016 was also impacted by our acquisition in january 2016 of substantially all of the assets of jw homes wieland which are geared toward moveup homebuyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 88  in 2017  compared with 87  in 2016  86  in 2015  86  in 2014  and 85  in 2013  the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a shift in our business toward moveup homebuyers who tend to prefer detached homes 

backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 40 billion   8996  units at december 31 2017  and 29 billion   7422  units at december 31 2016  for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2017  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2018  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to meet the needs of consumers we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option contracts which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements can serve to reduce the financial risk associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we may also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development if we determine that they do not fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is zoned and developed or is ready for development for our intended use in the normal course of business we periodically sell land not required by our homebuilding operations where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and when needed local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2017  we controlled 141409  lots of which 89253  were owned and 52156  were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined homebuyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the needs of potential homebuyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each consumer group through our understanding of each consumer group we are able to provide homes that better meet the needs and wants of each homebuyer 

our homes targeted to firsttime homebuyers tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices or higher density moveup homebuyers tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults to whom we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for homebuyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area many of these communities are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the age fiftyfive and over homebuyer to maintain an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than firsttime or moveup homebuyer communities 



as illustrated in the above table our sales mix has shifted in recent years toward the moveup homebuyer where demand has been stronger this shift in us housing demand occurred primarily due to financial challenges facing the firsttime homebuyer despite a generally recovering us economy including the overhang of consumer debt especially student loans related to higher education and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment however the firsttime homebuyer has 

 5 

historically played a major role in new housing and we believe that our firsttime homebuyer volume has been increasing recently and will continue to increase in coming years 

we market our homes to prospective homebuyers through internet listings and link placements mobile applications media advertising illustrated brochures and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays techenabled customers in addition our websites  wwwcentexcom wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom   wwwdivostacom and wwwjwhomescom  provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us 

our sales teams in many cases together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which seeks to ensure that homebuyers are comfortable at every stage of the process fully furnished and landscaped model homes physically located in our communities which leverage the expertise of our interior designers are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we are also introducing virtual reality walkthroughs of our house floor plans in certain communities to provide prospective homebuyers a more cost effective means to provide a realistic vision of our homes 

we believe that we are an innovator in consumerinspired home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants follow a 12step product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of house floor plans and elevations in each community including potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop fixture and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that generally are priced on a fixedprice basis using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver quality throughout all aspects of the house construction process 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to build superior quality homes while maintaining efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and by using industry and companyspecific construction practices we are improving our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

the ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices remains challenging as labor supply growth has not kept pace with construction demand additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices national tariffs and other foreign trade expenses to protect against changes in construction costs labor and materials costs are generally established prior to or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize costs we are also working to establish a more integrated 

 6 

system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future 

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 3  of us new home sales in 2017  in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rental housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees and suppliers  subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating as a captive business model targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding for homes sold we originated the mortgage loans of 66  in 2017  65  in 2016  65  in 2015  61  in 2014  and 64  in 2013  such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 80  in 2017  81  in 2016  83  in 2015  80  in 2014  and 80  in 2013  

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks 

 7 

and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center for our mortgage operations that performs underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a makewhole payment 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the us we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2017  we employed 4810  people of which 879  people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation which is generally based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel subject to adherence to our established policies and procedures and our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and a deterioration in industry conditions or downward changes in general economic or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could adversely affect our financial condition 

beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy during this period we incurred significant losses including impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets since 2011 overall industry new home sales have increased and we returned to profitability beginning in 2012 however the recovery in housing demand has been slow by historical standards and the adjustments we have made to our operating strategy may not be successful if the current housing market were to deteriorate significantly 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease and result in writedowns of the carrying values of land we own 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss at times we have been required to record significant writedowns of the carrying value of our land inventory and we have elected not to exercise options to purchase land even though that required us to forfeit deposits and writeoff preacquisition costs although we have taken efforts to reduce our exposure to costs of that type a certain amount of exposure is inherent in our homebuilding business if market conditions were to deteriorate in the future we could again be required to record significant write downs to our land inventory which would decrease the asset values reflected on our balance sheet and adversely affect our earnings and our stockholders equity 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to uneven industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices as well as government regulation during 2017 we experienced increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor in some areas increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs andor construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

 9 

products supplied to us and work done by subcontractors can expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business 

we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in some cases to select and obtain building materials despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures in some cases subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials defective products widely used by the homebuilding industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes the cost of complying with our warranty obligations may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repairs from subcontractors materials suppliers and insurers 

we also can suffer damage to our reputation and may be exposed to possible liability if subcontractors fail to comply with applicable laws including laws involving actions or matters that are not within our control when we learn about possibly improper practices by subcontractors we attempt to cause the subcontractors to discontinue them and may terminate the use of such subcontractors however attempts at mitigation may not avoid claims against us relating to actions of or matters relating to our subcontractors 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build we experience significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan to date the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex corporation centex which we acquired in 2009 for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through pulte mortgage mortgage interest rates have remained near historical lows for several years which has made new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to 

 10 

sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans additionally the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes 

mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home on december 22 2017 a law commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted while the tax act lowers the tax rates applicable to many businesses and individuals it also among other things i limits the federal deduction for mortgage interest so that it only applies to the first 750000 of a new mortgage as compared to 1 million under previous tax law ii introduces a 10000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes including real estate taxes and iii eliminates the federal deduction for interest on home equity loans while the ultimate impact of the tax act is not known these tax changes may raise the overall cost of home ownership in certain of our existing or future communities lessen the perceived financial benefits of home ownership or otherwise reduce demand for our homes increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for the future development of our business and other capital needs without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2017  we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 3062 million  as well as 7645 million  available under our revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit however our internal sources of liquidity and revolving credit facility may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2017  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2355 million  and 12 billion  respectively these letters of credit are generally issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the us housing industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable land financing raw materials skilled management and labor resources we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volume competition can also affect our ability to procure suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or other terms 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing 

increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

 11 

the loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our operating employees could negatively affect our business 

our success depends upon the skills experience and active participation of our senior management many of whom have been with the company for a significant number of years if we were to lose members of our senior management we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our operations could be negatively affected also the loss of a significant number of operating employees in key roles or geographies where we are not able to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2017  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 7139 million  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 686 million  the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income or income tax would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income or income tax in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities our shareholder rights plan as amended expires june 1 2019 unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

our ability to use certain of centexs federal losses and credits is limited under section 382 of the irc we do not believe that the section 382 limitations will prevent us from utilizing these centex losses and credits we do believe that full utilization of certain state nol carryforwards will be limited due to section 382

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to the following that impact us 1 reducing the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent 2 eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax “amt” and changing how existing amt credits can be realized 3 creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense 4 repealing the domestic production activities deduction 5 limiting the deductibility of certain executive compensation and 6 limiting certain other deductions while we continue to evaluate the effects of the tax act we have recorded a net tax expense of 1721 million  in 2017 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance and other effects we expect that the tax act will have a favorable impact on our financial results beginning in 2018 in the absence of guidance on various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the tax act we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the tax act however it is possible that the irs could issue subsequent guidance or take positions in an audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions which could have a material adverse effect on our cash tax liabilities results of operations or financial condition 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building safety environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by us policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by us we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the 

 13 

uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected in 2017 hurricanes harvey and irma caused disruptions in our texas and florida operations respectively but did not result in a material impact to our 2017 results of operations 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which may have a negative impact on demand for our homes in an inflationary environment economic conditions and other market factors may make it difficult for us to raise home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which would reduce our profit margins although the rate of inflation has been historically low for the last several years we currently are experiencing increases in the prices of labor and materials above the general inflation rate 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees or cyberattacks or errors by thirdparty vendors who have access to our confidential data or that of our customers while we are continuously working to improve our information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing malware and other cyber risks to enhance our levels of protection to the extent possible against cyber risks and security breaches and monitor to prevent detect address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access misuse computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact there is no assurance that advances in computer capabilities new technologies methods or other developments will detect or prevent security breaches and safeguard access to proprietary or confidential information if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly or if there are intrusions of critical infrastructure such as the power grid or communications systems we could suffer extended interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our employees homebuyers and business partners any such disruption could damage our reputation result in market value declines lead to legal proceedings against us by affected thirdparties resulting in penalties or fines and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

we can be injured by improper acts of persons over whom we do not have control or by the attempt to impose liabilities or obligations of third parties on us 

although we expect all of our employees officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws rules and regulations there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable laws regulations or governmental guidelines when we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations including practices relating to homes buildings or multifamily rental properties we build or finance we move actively to stop the noncomplying practices as soon as possible and we have taken disciplinary action regarding employees of ours who were aware of noncomplying practices and did not take steps to address them including in some instances terminating their employment however regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties and our reputation can be injured due to the practices having taken place 

 14 

the homes we sell are built by employees of subcontractors and other contract parties we do not have the ability to control what these contract parties pay their employees or subcontractors or the work rules they impose on their employees or subcontractors however various governmental agencies are trying to hold contract parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other workrelated laws by firms whose employees are performing contracted for services governmental rulings or changes in state or local laws that make us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us in situations that are not within our control

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal and governmental proceedings incidental to our continuing business operations many involving claims related to certain construction defects the consequences of these matters are not presently determinable but in our opinion after consulting with legal counsel and taking into account insurance and reserves the ultimate liability is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows however to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter we could incur additional charges that could be significant

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

demand conditions continued to improve in the overall us housing market in 2017 although the recovery in housing demand has been slow by historical standards the growth in demand for new homes is being supported by job creation high consumer confidence a supportive interest rate environment and a limited supply of new homes within this environment we remain focused on driving additional gains in construction and asset efficiency to deliver higher returns on invested capital consistent with our positive market view and longterm business strategy we expect to use our capital to support future growth while consistently returning funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

the nature of the homebuilding industry results in a lag between when investments made in land acquisition and development yield new community openings and related home closings our focus continues to be on adding volume growth to the efficiency gains we have achieved in recent years our prior investments are allowing us to grow the business as evidenced by 11  growth in net new orders and a 12   increase  in home sale revenues to 83 billion  we achieved this growth while also maintaining our focus on gross margin performance through community location strategic pricing and construction efficiencies 

during 2017 we opened approximately 250 new communities across our local markets as a result of increased land investment over the last few years this volume of new community openings can present a challenge in todays environment where entitlement and land development delays are common we have grown our investment in the business in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects and working to shorten our years of land supply including the use of land option agreements when possible we have also focused our land investments on closerin locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately moderates we have accepted the tradeoff of having to pay more for certain land positions where we can be more confident in future performance leveraging our increased land investments we expect to open a similar number of new communities in 2018 as in 2017 which we expect will help our volume grow in 2018 

our financial position provided flexibility to increase our investments in future communities while also returning funds to shareholders through dividends and expanded share repurchases specifically we accomplished the following in 2017

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

 23 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2017  were higher  than 2016  by 09 billion  or 12  the increase  was attributable to a 6   increase  in the average selling price and a 6   increase  in closings the increase  in closings reflects the significant land investments we have made and the resulting increase in our active communities these increased closings occurred despite the disruption in our operations caused by hurricane harvey in houston texas and hurricane irma in florida as well as permitting and other municipal approval delays in certain communities the higher average selling price for 2017  reflected a shift toward moveup homebuyers 

home sale revenues for 2016  were higher  than 2015  by 17 billion  or 29  the increase  was attributable to a 10   increase  in the average selling price and a 16   increase  in closings these increases reflect the impact of communities acquired from wieland during the period which contributed 6  to the growth in revenue 4  to the growth in closings and 1  to the increase in average selling price excluding the communities acquired from wieland the increase  in closings reflects the significant investments we made in opening new communities combined with improved demand the increase  in average selling price reflected a shift in our revenue mix toward moveup homebuyers 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 224  in 2017  compared with 250  in 2016  and 269  in 2015  our results in 2017  include the effect of the aforementioned land inventory impairments totaling 890 million  see note 2  and a warranty charge of 124 million  see note 11  combined these factors reduced gross margin in 2017  by 120 basis points the assets acquired from wieland contributed 60 basis points to the decrease in 2016 primarily as the result of required fair value adjustments associated with the acquired homes in production and related lots gross margins remain strong relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors including shifts in community mix relatively stable pricing conditions in 2017  following strong pricing conditions in 2016  and 2015  and lower amortized interest costs  17  17  and 24  of home sale revenues in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively combined with higher house construction and land costs as the supply chain has responded to the housing recovery 

land sales 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales contributed net gains losses of 773 million  39 million  and 127 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the loss in 2017 resulted from the aforementioned net realizable value charges of 836 million  see note 2  

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 107  and 128  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased   656 million  or 7  in 2017  compared with 2016  sga includes the aforementioned insurance receivable writeoffs of 296 million  in 2017  and general liability insurance reserve reversals of 951 million  and 552 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively resulting from favorable claims experience see note 11  excluding these items the improvement in our yearoveryear sga leverage was primarily attributable to cost efficiencies realized in late 2016 that continued into 2017 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 128  and 137  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga increased   1624 million  or 20  in 2016  compared with 2015  sga included general liability insurance reserve reversals of 552 million  and 622 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively see note 11  sga also reflects restructuring costs of 100 million  in 2016 associated with actions taken to reduce overheads and the substantial completion of our corporate headquarters relocation from michigan to georgia which began in 2013 excluding these items the improvement in our yearoveryear sga leverage was even greater the increase in gross dollar sga reflects the addition of field resources and other variable costs related to increased production volumes combined with higher costs related to healthcare and professional fees additionally sga for 2016 reflects the impact of transaction and integration costs associated with the assets acquired from wieland in january 2016 see  note 1

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



 

net new orders 

net new orders increased   11  in 2017  compared with 2016  the increase resulted primarily from the higher number of active communities which increased   9  to 790  at december 31 2017  net new orders in dollars increased  by 21  compared with 2016  due to the growth in units combined with the higher average selling price the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period decreased  in 2017  from 2016  at 14  and 15  respectively ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed increased   21  at december 31 2017  compared with december 31 2016  as measured in units and increased   35  over the prior year period as measured in dollars the higher average sales price when compared to 2016  also contributed to the higher backlog dollars 

net new orders increased   13  in 2016  compared with 2015  the increase resulted from improved sales per community combined with selling from a larger number of active communities which increased 17  to 726  active communities at december 31 2016  the communities acquired from wieland contributed to this growth in units by 4  excluding the wieland assets our growth in net new order units resulted from the higher number of active communities combined with a small improvement in sales pace per community the cancellation rate increased  slightly in 2016  from 2015  at 15  and 14  respectively ending backlog units increased   10  at december 31 2016  compared with december 31 2015  and increased   20  as measured in dollars due to the increase in average selling price the higher average sales price also contributed to the higher backlog dollars

the number of homes in production at december 31 2017  was 17   higher  compared to december 31 2016  the increase in homes under production was due to a combination of factors including a 9  increase in active communities and higher net new order volume resulting in a 21  increase in ending backlog units as part of our inventory management

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  

a includes net reserve releases for loan origination reserves of 114 million  in 2015

revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2017   increase d 6  compared with 2016  the increase  is primarily related to higher mortgage and title volumes resulting from increased home closings in the homebuilding segment partially offset by lower mortgage revenue per loan refinance activity has slowed in the mortgage industry which has increased competition pressured loan pricing and resulted in lower revenue per loan for us in 2017 total financial services revenues during 2016   increase d 29  compared with 2015  due to a higher loan origination volume resulting from higher volumes in the homebuilding segment combined with higher revenues per loan which were largely attributable to a higher average loan size combined with favorable market conditions 

income before income taxes 

the increase d income before income taxes for 2017  as compared with 2016  is due to increased revenues especially within our title operations the increase d income before income taxes for 2016  as compared with 2015  is due to higher origination volume and an increase in revenue per loan combined with better overhead leverage along with contributions from our title operations 

during 2016  and 2015  we reduced our loan origination liabilities by net reserve releases of 05 million  and 114 million  respectively based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and existing conditions such adjustments are reflected in financial services expenses see note 11  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 524  355  and 395  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the 2017  effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the impacts of the tax act state income tax expense on current year earnings the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters the domestic production activities deduction and state tax law changes the 2016  effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance related to a legal entity restructuring the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters the impact on our net deferred tax assets due to changes in business operations and state tax laws and recognition of energy efficient home credits the 2015  effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and the impact of changes in business operations and state tax laws to our net deferred tax assets 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings 

at december 31 2017  we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 2727 million  restricted cash balances of 335 million  and 7645 million  available under our revolving credit facility we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a broad portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm deposits and investments 

we retired outstanding debt totaling 1347 million  9869 million  and 2392 million  during 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding our financial services debt was 420  at december 31 2017  

unsecured senior notes 

in february 2016  we issued 10 billion  of unsecured senior notes consisting of 3000 million  of 425  senior notes due march 1 2021  and 7000 million  of 550  senior notes due march 1 2026  the net proceeds from this senior notes issuance were used to fund the retirement of 4652 million  of our senior notes that matured in may 2016 with the remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes in july 2016  we issued an additional 10 billion  of unsecured senior notes consisting of an additional 4000 million  of the 425  senior notes due march 1 2021  and 6000 million  of 5  senior notes due january 15 2027  the net proceeds from the july senior notes issuance were used for general corporate purposes and to pay down approximately 5000 million  of outstanding debt including the remainder of a then existing term loan facility the senior notes issued in 2016 are unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with the existing and future senior 

 32 

unsecured indebtedness of the company and each of the guarantors respectively the notes are redeemable at our option at any time up to the date of maturity 

revolving credit facility 

we maintain a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” that matures in june 2019  the revolving credit facility contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the revolving credit facility to 125 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments in october 2017 we exercised the accordion feature to increase the maximum borrowing capacity from 7500 million  to 10 billion  the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce the available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility with a sublimit of 5000 million  at december 31 2017  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the london interbank offered rate libor or base rate plus an applicable margin as defined therein we had no  borrowings outstanding and 2355 million  and 2191 million  of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debttocapitalization ratio as each term is defined in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all covenants outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries our available and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit amounted to 7645 million  and 5309 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

other notes payable

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the loans are sold in the secondary market which generally occurs within 30 days 

pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement with third party lenders in august 2017  pulte mortgage entered into an amended and restated repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” that extended the termination date to august 2018  the maximum aggregate commitment was 4750 million  with a 500 million  uncommitted accordion feature to allow for a temporary increase up to 5250 million  during the seasonally high borrowing period from december 26 2017 through january 11 2018 at all other times the maximum aggregate commitment ranges from 2500 million  to 4000 million  the purpose of the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage including quantitative thresholds related to net worth net income and liquidity pulte mortgage had 4378 million  and 3316 million  outstanding under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and was in compliance with its covenants and requirements as of such dates 

share repurchase programs 

in previous years our board of directors authorized and announced a share repurchase program in july 2016 our board of directors approved an increase of 1 billion  to such authorization we repurchased 354 million  309 million  and 212 million  shares in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively for a total of 9103 million  6000 million  and 4337 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively under these programs at december 31 2017  we had remaining authorization to repurchase 944 million  of common shares on january 25 2018  our board of directors increased our repurchase authorization by 5000 million

dividends 

our declared quarterly cash dividends totaled 1100 million  1222 million  and 1179 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

cash flows 

operating activities 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2017  was 6631 million  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 683 million  in 2016  and net cash used in operating activities of 3376 million  in 2015  generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale our positive cash flow from operations for 2017  was primarily due to income before income taxes of 9388 million  which included 1919 million  in noncash landrelated charges these were partially offset by a net increase in inventories of 5690 million  resulting from ongoing land acquisition and development investment to support future growth combined with additional house inventory to support the higher backlog 

our positive cash flow from operations for 2016  was primarily due to our income before income taxes of 9339 million  which was largely offset by a net increase in inventories of 8971 million  resulting from increased land investment combined with a net increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale of 995 million  

our negative cash flow from operations for 2015  was primarily due to a net increase in inventories of 9173 million  resulting from increased land investment combined with a net increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale of 1046 million  partially offset by our income before income taxes of 8160 million  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 502 million  in 2017  compared with 4712 million  in 2016  and 346 million  in 2015  the use of cash from investing activities in 2017  was primarily due to 321 million  of capital expenditures and 230 million  for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries the use of cash from investing activities in 2016  was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from wieland see note 1  the use of cash from investing activities in 2015  was primarily due to 454 million  of capital expenditures and an 86 million increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 10 billion  in 2017  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of 3507 million  and net cash used in financing activities of 1616 million  during 2016  and 2015  respectively the net cash used in financing activities for 2017  resulted primarily from the repurchase of 354 million  common shares for 9103 million  under our repurchase authorization repayments of debt of 1347 million  and cash dividends of 1127 million  partially offset by net borrowings of 1062 million  under the repurchase agreement related to a seasonal increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

repayments of debt were 9869 million  and 2392 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively offset by incremental borrowings of 637 million  and 1276 million  under the repurchase agreement during 2016  and 2015  respectively cash provided by financing activities for 2016  resulted primarily from the proceeds of the unsecured senior notes issuance for 20 billion  offset by the repurchase of 309 million  common shares for 6000 million  and cash dividend of 1247 million  cash used in financing activities for 2015 was offset by 4981 million  of proceeds from the previously existing term loan facility executed in 2015 and also includes dividend payments of 1160 million  and the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase authorization for 4427 million  

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to 

 34 

compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  

  

 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2017  we had 2080 million  of deposits and preacquisition costs of which 118 million  is refundable relating to option agreements to acquire 52156  lots with a remaining purchase price of 25 billion  we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next two years 

we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2005   2017  at december 31 2017  we had 486 million  of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 49 million  of related accrued interest and penalties 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2017  





 35 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2017  we had outstanding letters of credit of 2355 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 12 billion  at december 31 2017  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2017  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 25 billion  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices 

at december 31 2017  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 595 million  of which 563 million  was related to one joint venture in which we have a 50 interest in connection with this loan we and our joint venture partner provided customary limited recourse guaranties in which our maximum financial loss exposure is limited to our pro rata share of the debt outstanding see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 36 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1  to our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding  – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the homebuyer in situations where the homebuyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the homebuyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit on such sale is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed if there is a loss on the sale of the property the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services  – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory and cost of revenues 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and closing costs applicable to the home sales commissions are classified within selling general and administrative expenses the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we test inventory for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the cash flows estimated to be generated by the community are less than its carrying amount such indicators include gross margins or sales paces significantly below expectations construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community and other known qualitative factors communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the 

 37 

community to its carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we determine the fair value of the community and impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing the long life cycles of many communities and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

estimating the required liability for these potential losses requires a significant level of management judgment during 2016  and 2015  we reduced our loan origination liabilities by net reserve releases of 05 million  and 114 million  respectively based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and existing conditions reserves provided released are reflected in financial services expenses given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to and in limited instances exceeding 10 years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the projected cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

income taxes 

we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence this evaluation considers among other factors historical operating results forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the outlooks for the us housing industry and broader economy the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time while we continue to evaluate the effects of the tax act enacted in december 2017 including the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities we reduced our deferred tax assets by 1721 million  in 2017 to reflect the lower us corporate income tax rate 

 38 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to income taxes and unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 7588 million  and 8311 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 65  and 70  of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 650 million to 875 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims additionally ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs during 2017  2016  and 2015  we reduced general liability reserves by 951 million  552 million  and 296 million  respectively as a result of changes in estimates resulting from actual claim experience observed being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections the changes in actuarial estimates were driven by changes in actual claims experience that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims these changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods which resulted in adjustments to the ibnr portion of our recorded liabilities during 2015  we also recorded a general liability reserve reversal of 326 million  resulting from a legal settlement relating to plumbing claims initially reported to us in 2008 and for which our recorded liabilities were adjusted over time based on changes in facts and circumstances these claims ultimately resulted in a class action lawsuit involving a national vendor and numerous other homebuilders homebuyers and insurance companies in 2015  a global settlement was reached pursuant to which we funded our agreed upon share of settlement costs which were significantly lower than our previously estimated exposure 

in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable our receivables from insurance carriers totaled 2134 million  and 3073 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and 

 39 

we recorded writeoffs of 296 million  of insurance receivables associated with the resolution of certain insurance matters in 2017  the insurance receivables relate to costs incurred or to be incurred to perform corrective repairs settle claims with customers and other costs related to the continued progression of both known and anticipated future construction defect claims that we believe to be insured related to previously closed homes we believe collection of these insurance receivables is probable based on the legal merits of our positions after review by legal counsel favorable legal rulings received to date the credit quality of our carriers and our long history of collecting significant amounts of insurance reimbursements under similar insurance policies related to similar claims including significant amounts funded by the above carriers under different policies while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates we utilize both fixedrate and variablerate debt for fixedrate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variablerate debt changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay our debt prior to maturity as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt 

the following tables set forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of december 31 2017  and 2016  000’s omitted 



a includes the pulte mortgage repurchase agreement there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at either december 31 2017  or 2016  

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 60  days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we generally enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

at december 31 2017  and 2016  residential mortgage loans availableforsale had an aggregate fair value of 5706 million  and 5395 million  respectively at december 31 2017  and 2016  we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of 2109 million  and 2739 million  respectively which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment unexpired forward contracts totaled 5220 million  and 6100 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and whole loan investor commitments totaled 2031 million  and 1576 million  respectively at such dates hypothetical changes

in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments

homebuilding operations 



after several years of declining sales volume new home sales in the us increased in 2012 for the first time since 2005 beginning a multiyear recovery in demand this trend continued in 2016 as new home sales in the us rose 12  to approximately 563000  homes an approximate 84  increase from 2011 the bottom of the most recent housing downturn additionally mortgage interest rates remain near historic lows and the overall inventory of homes available for sale especially new homes remains low although current industry volume remains low compared with historical levels the improved environment and actions we have taken contributed to significant increases in our income before income taxes each year in the period 2013  2016 in the long term we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among our national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions continue to recover in the shortterm we expect that overall market conditions will continue to improve but that improvements will occur unevenly across our markets our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2016  we had 726  active communities spanning 49  markets across 25  states sales prices of unit closings during 2016  ranged from approximately 100000  to over 1000000  with 80  falling within the range of 150000  to 500000  the average unit selling price in 2016  was 373000  compared with 338000  in 2015  329000  in 2014  305000  in 2013  and 276000  in 2012  the increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors including improved market conditions and a shift in our sales mix toward moveup homebuyers our average unit selling price in 2016 was also impacted by our acquisition in january 2016 of substantially all of the assets of jw homes wieland which are geared toward moveup buyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 87  in 2016  compared with 86  in 2015  86  in 2014  85  in 2013  and 81  in 2012  the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a shift in our business toward the moveup buyer who tends to prefer detached homes 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 29 billion   7422  units at december 31 2016  and 25 billion   6731  units at december 31 2015  for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2016  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2017  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale to homebuyers we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to meet the needs of consumers we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option contracts which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements reduces the financial risk associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we may also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development if we determine that they do not fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is zoned and developed or is ready for development for our intended use in the normal course of business we periodically sell land not required by our homebuilding operations where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and when needed local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2016  we controlled 143258  lots of which 99279  were owned and 43979  were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the needs of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each consumer group through our understanding of each consumer group we are able to provide homes that better meet the needs and wants of each buyer 



our homes targeted to firsttime buyers tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices or higher density moveup buyers tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults to whom we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area many of these communities are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the age fiftyfive and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than firsttime or moveup buyer communities as illustrated in the above table our sales mix has shifted in recent years toward the moveup buyer where demand has been stronger this shift in us housing demand has occurred primarily due to financial challenges facing the firsttime buyer including a recovering us economy the overhang of consumer debt especially student loans related to higher education and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment 

 5 

we market our homes to prospective buyers through internet listings and link placements mobile applications media advertising illustrated brochures and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays techenabled customers in addition our websites  wwwcentexcom wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom   wwwdivostacom and wwwjwhomescom  provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us there were approximately 104 million  unique visits to our websites during 2016  compared with approximately 96 million  in 2015  

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in consumerinspired home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants follow a 12step product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

typically our sales teams in some cases together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which seeks to ensure that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process fully furnished and landscaped model homes physically located in our communities which leverage the expertise of our interior designers are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that generally cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver all aspects of the house construction process 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and by utilizing standard construction practices we are improving our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

the ability to consistently source qualified labor at reasonable prices has become more challenging as labor supply growth has not kept pace with construction demand additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices to protect against changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize costs we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 4  of us new home sales in 2016  in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rental housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees and suppliers  subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the federal housing administration fha and department of veterans affairs va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating as a captive business model targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding during 2016  2015  and 2014  we originated mortgage loans for 65  65  and 61  respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 812  in 2016  829  in 2015  and 802  in 2014  

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time 

 7 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center for our mortgage operations that performs underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a makewhole payment 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the us we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2016  we employed 4623  people of which 829  people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel subject to adherence to our established policies and procedures and our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and a deterioration in industry conditions or downward changes in general economic or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings that could adversely affect our financial condition 

beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy during this period we incurred significant losses including impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets since 2011 overall industry new home sales have increased and we returned to profitability beginning in 2012 however the overall demand for new homes remains below historical levels accordingly we can provide no assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy will be successful if the current housing market was to deteriorate significantly 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent years as the supply chain adjusts to uneven industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs and  or construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

 9 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in the past we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan to date the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex corporation centex which we acquired in 2009 for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through our mortgage bank while mortgage interest rates have increased moderately they have been near historical lows for several years which has made new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans additionally the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes 

 10 

mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for the future development of our business and other capital needs without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2016  we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 7232 million  as well as 5309 million  available under our revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit however our internal sources of liquidity and revolving credit facility may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2016  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2191 million  and 11 billion  respectively these letters of credit are issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the us housing industry is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations

we may not realize our deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2016  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 11 billion  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 649 million  the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income or income tax would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income or income tax in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities our shareholder rights plan as amended expires june 1 2019 unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

our ability to use certain of centexs federal losses and credits is limited under section 382 of the irc we do not believe that the section 382 limitations will prevent us from utilizing these centex losses and credits we do believe that full utilization of certain state nol carryforwards will be limited due to section 382 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to 

 12 

provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by us policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by us we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative impact on housing demand 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our homebuyers and business partners which could require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

improved demand conditions in the overall us housing market continued in 2016 though industrywide new home sales continue to pace below historical averages we remain pleased with the overall demand for new homes which continues along a sustained path of recovery supported by ongoing job creation low unemployment a supportive interest rate environment and a limited supply of new homes within this environment we remain focused on driving additional gains in construction and asset efficiency to deliver higher returns on invested capital consistent with our positive market view and longterm business strategy we expect to use our capital to support future growth while consistently returning funds to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 

the nature of the homebuilding industry results in a lag between when investments made in land acquisition and development yield new community openings and related home closings we have looked toward 2016 as a year where we would begin adding volume growth to the efficiency gains we have achieved in recent years our prior investments are allowing us to grow the business as evidenced by 13  growth in net new orders and a 29   increase  in home sale revenues to 75 billion  we achieved this growth while also maintaining our focus on gross margin performance through community location strategic pricing and construction efficiencies 

during 2016 we opened approximately 200 new communities across our local markets as a result of increased land investment over the last few years additionally we acquired substantially all of the assets of jw homes wieland in january 2016 which also contributed to the growth in community count this volume of new community openings can present a challenge in todays environment where entitlement and land development delays are common we have grown our investment in the business in a disciplined manner by emphasizing smaller projects and working to shorten our years of land supply including the use of land option agreements when possible we have also focused our land investments on closerin locations where we think demand is more sustainable when the market ultimately moderates we have accepted the tradeoff of having to pay more for certain land positions where we can be more confident in future performance leveraging our increased land investments we expect to open an even higher number of new communities in 2017 than we did in 2016 which we expect will help our volume grow in 2017 

our financial position provided flexibility to increase our investments in future communities while also returning funds to shareholders through dividends and expanded share repurchases specifically we accomplished the following in 2016

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

 22 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2016  were higher  than 2015  by 17 billion  or 29  the increase  was attributable to a 10   increase  in the average selling price and a 16   increase  in closings these increases reflect the impact of communities acquired from wieland during the period which contributed 6  to the growth in revenue 4  to the growth in closings and 1  to the increase in average selling price excluding the communities acquired from wieland the increase  in closings reflects the significant investments we are making in opening new communities combined with improved demand the higher average selling price for 2016  reflects an ongoing shift toward moveup buyers the inclusion of higherpriced homes offered in wieland communities and generally stable market conditions 

home sale revenues for 2015  were higher  than 2014  by 1305 million  or 2  the increase  was attributable to a 3   increase  in the average selling price while closings remained relatively flat the increase  in average selling price reflected a shift in our revenue mix toward moveup buyers closing volume was flat as higher net new orders were offset by production delays in certain communities caused by a number of factors including tight labor resources and adverse weather conditions 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 250  in 2016  compared with 269  in 2015  and 267  in 2014  the assets acquired from wieland contributed 60 basis points to this decrease for this period primarily as the result of required fair value adjustments associated with the acquired homes in production and related lots gross margins remain strong relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors including shifts in community mix relatively stable pricing conditions in 2016  following strong pricing conditions in 2015  and 2014  and lower amortized interest costs  17  24  and 34  of home sale revenues in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively combined with higher house construction and land costs as the supply chain has responded to the housing recovery the lower amortized interest costs resulted from the reduction in our outstanding debt in recent years combined with the significant increase in volume in 2016 

land sales 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales had margin contributions of 39 million  127 million  and 108 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 128  and 137  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga increased   1624 million  or 20  in 2016  compared with 2015  sga included adjustments to general liability insurance reserves relating to reversals of 552 million  and 622 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively see note 12  sga also reflects severance costs of 91 million  in 2016 associated with actions taken to reduce overheads and the substantial completion of our corporate headquarters relocation from michigan to georgia which began in 2013 see note 2  excluding these items the improvement in our yearoveryear sga leverage was even greater the increase in gross dollar sga reflects the addition of field resources and other variable costs related to increased production volumes combined with higher costs related to healthcare and professional fees additionally sga for 2016  reflects the impact of transaction and integration costs associated with the assets acquired from wieland in january 2016 see  note 1  

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 137  and 152  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased   667 million  or 8  in 2015  compared with 2014  sga included reserve reversals totaling 622 million  in 2015  and charges totaling 693 million  to increase general liability reserves in 2014  see note 12  additionally we incurred 20 million  and 76 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively of employee severance retention relocation and related costs attributable to the relocation of our corporate headquarters see note 2  excluding each of these items sga in both dollars and as a percentage of home sale revenues increased for 2015 compared with 2014 this increase in gross overhead dollars in 2015 was primarily due to investments in increased headcount and information systems along with higher costs in conjunction with the opening of an increased number of new communities 

 23 

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



 lease exit and related costs for 2016  resulted from actions taken to reduce overheads and the substantial completion of our corporate headquarters relocation from michigan to georgia which began in 2013 and also significantly impacted 2014 see note 2  the increase in writeoffs of deposits and preacquisition costs for 2016 related primarily to one project in california that we elected to not complete miscellaneous net includes a charge of 150 million  related to the settlement of a disputed land transaction in 2016 and a charge of 200 million  resulting from the applecross matter in 2015  see note 12  for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements 

net new orders 

net new orders increased   13  in 2016  compared with 2015  the increase resulted primarily from selling from a larger number of active communities which increased   17  to 726  at december 31 2016  the communities acquired from wieland contributed to this growth in units by 4  excluding the wieland assets our growth in net new order units resulted from the higher number of active communities combined with a small improvement in sales pace per community net new orders in dollars increased  by 23  compared with 2015  due to the growth in units combined with the higher average selling price the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period increased  slightly in 2016  from 2015  at 15  and 14  respectively ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed increased   10  at december 31 2016  compared with december 31 2015  as measured in units and increased   20  over the prior year period as measured in dollars the higher average sales price also contributed to the higher backlog dollars 

net new orders increased   8  in 2015  compared with 2014  the increase resulted from improved sales per community combined with selling from a larger number of active communities which increased 4  to 620  active communities at december 31 2015  the cancellation rate decreased  slightly in 2015  from 2014  at 14  and 15  respectively ending backlog units increased   15  at december 31 2015  compared with december 31 2014  and increased   26  as measured in dollars due to the increase in average selling price the higher backlog resulted from higher net new order volume combined with production delays in certain communities in 2015  caused by a number of factors including tight labor resources and adverse weather conditions 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2016  and 2015  



 24 

the number of homes in production at december 31 2016  was 14   higher  compared to december 31 2015  the increase in homes under production was due to a combination of factors including a 17  increase in active communities a 10  increase in ending backlog units higher net new order volume and a decision to purposefully increase the number of unsold homes under construction spec homes the increase in spec homes reflects our intentions to achieve a more even flow production cycle over the course of 2017 compared with recent years as part of our inventory management strategy we will continue to maintain reasonable inventory levels relative to demand in each of our markets we continue to focus on maintaining a low level of completed specs though inventory levels tend to fluctuate throughout the year 

controlled lots 

the following is a summary of our lots under control at december 31 2016  and 2015  



of our controlled lots 99279  and 95919  were owned and 43979  and 42160  were under land option agreements at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively while competition for wellpositioned land is robust we continue to pursue strategic land positions that drive appropriate returns on invested capital the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 21 billion  at december 31 2016  these land option agreements generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years our maximum exposure related to these land option agreements is generally limited to our deposits and preacquisition costs which totaled 1954 million  of which 98 million  is refundable at december 31 2016

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  

a includes loan origination reserve releases of 114 million  and 186 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively

revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2016   increase d 29  compared with 2015  the increase  resulted from a higher loan origination volume resulting from higher volumes in the homebuilding segment combined with higher revenues per loan which were largely attributable to a higher average loan size combined with favorable market conditions total financial services revenues during 2015   increase d 12  compared with 2014  as the result of a higher capture rate and higher revenues per loan which were attributable to a higher average loan size combined with a modest improvement in loan pricing the improvement in loan pricing in 2015 resulted primarily from a spike in mortgage industry refinancing volume in early 2015 which reduced competitive pricing pressures for new originations loan pricing came under more pressure in more recent months as industry refinancing volume receded however the overall pricing environment for new originations remains favorable 

since 2007 the mortgage industry has experienced a significant overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production adjustable rate mortgages “arms” accounted for 5  of funded loan production in 2016  compared with 6  and 11  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the shifts in arm volume contributed to the higher revenues per loan in 2016  and 2015  as arms generally contain lower margins additionally fixed rate mortgages tend to have higher servicing values 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

estimating the required liability for these potential losses requires a significant level of management judgment during 2015  and 2014  we reduced our loan origination liabilities by net reserve releases of 114 million  and 186 million  respectively based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and existing conditions such adjustments are reflected in financial services expenses given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements 

income before income taxes 

the increase d income before income taxes for 2016  as compared with 2015  is due to higher origination volume and an increase  in revenue per loan combined with better overhead leverage 

the increase d income before income taxes for 2015  as compared with 2014  is due to higher origination volume and an increase in revenue per loan the increase in expenses over the prior period is largely a result of an increase in headcount caused by the higher origination volume combined with the impact of changes in loan loss reserves discussed above 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 355  395  and 312  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the 2016  effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance related to a legal entity restructuring the favorable resolution of certain state income tax matters the impact on our net deferred tax assets due to changes in business operations and state tax laws and recognition of energy efficient home credits the 2015  effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and the impact of changes in business operations and state tax laws to our net deferred tax assets the 2014  effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance related to certain state deferred tax assets along with the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters

the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debttocapitalization ratio as each term is defined in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all covenants outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries our available and unused borrowings under the revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit amounted to 5309 million  and 3087 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the loans are sold in the secondary market which generally occurs within 30 days 

pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” with third party lenders in august 2016  pulte amended its repurchase agreement to extend the effective date to august 2017  and adjusted the maximum aggregate commitment amount according to seasonal borrowing capacity needs in december 2016 pulte mortgage again amended its repurchase agreement to increase the maximum aggregate commitment amount to cover seasonal borrowing capacity needs the maximum aggregate commitment was 3600 million  during the seasonally high borrowing period from december 27 2016 through january 12 2017 at all other times the maximum aggregate commitment ranges from 1750 million  to 2000 million  the purpose of the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage including quantitative thresholds related to net worth net income and liquidity pulte mortgage had 3316 million  and 2679 million  outstanding under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and was in compliance with its covenants and requirements as of such dates

cash flows 

operating activities 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2016  was 683 million  compared with net cash used in operating activities of 3376 million  in 2015  and net cash provided by operating activities of 3079 million  in 2014  generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels our positive cash flow from operations for 2016  was primarily due to income before income taxes of 9339 million  which was largely offset by a net increase in inventories of 8971 million  as the result of land acquisition and development investment to support future operations as well as more homes under construction as the result of higher production levels additionally residential mortgage loans availableforsale increased 995 million  as the result of an increase in loan originations in the month of december compared with the prior year 

our negative cash flow from operations for 2015  was primarily due to a net increase in inventories of 9173 million  resulting from increased land investment combined with a net increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale of 1046 million  partially offset by our income before income taxes of 8160 million  

our positive cash flow from operations for 2014  was primarily due to our income before income taxes of 6898 million  offset by a net increase in inventories of 3379 million  and an increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale of 537 million  

 33 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4712 million  in 2016  compared with 346 million  in 2015  and 1226 million  in 2014  the use of cash from investing activities in 2016  was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from wieland see note 1  

the use of cash from investing activities in 2015  was primarily due to 454 million  of capital expenditures and an 86 million increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment 

the use of cash from investing activities in 2014  was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from dominion homes see note 1  and 488 million  of capital expenditures related primarily to new community openings and the relocation of our corporate headquarters 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 3507 million  in 2016  compared with 1616 million  and 5291 million  of net cash used in financing during 2015  and 2014  respectively the net cash provided by financing activities for 2016  resulted primarily from the proceeds of the february and july senior unsecured notes issuances for 20 billion  offset by the retirement of debt totaling 9869 million  which included 4652 million  of our senior notes that matured in may 2016 and repayment of our previously outstanding term loan during 2016  we repurchased 309 million  common shares for 6000 million  under our repurchase authorization made payments of 1247 million  for cash dividends and had net borrowings of 637 million  under the repurchase agreement related to a seasonal increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

repayments of debt were 2392 million  and 2506 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively offset by incremental borrowings of 1276 million  and 346 million  under the repurchase agreement during 2015  and 2014  respectively cash used in financing activities for 2015  was offset by 4981 million  of proceeds from the term loan executed in september 2015 and also includes dividend payments of 1160 million  and the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase authorization for 4427 million  cash used in financing activities in 2014  reflects dividend payments of 756 million  and the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase authorization for 2530 million  

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  

  

 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2016  we had 1954 million  of deposits and preacquisition costs of which 98 million  is refundable relating to option agreements to acquire 43979  lots with a remaining purchase price of 21 billion  we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next two years and the remainder thereafter 

at december 31 2016  we had 215 million  of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 122 million  of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2005   2016  

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2016  



 

 35 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2016  we had outstanding letters of credit of 2191 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 11 billion  at december 31 2016  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2016  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 21 billion  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices 

at december 31 2016  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 46 million  of which our proportionate share was 13 million  see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 36 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1  to our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding  – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit on such sale is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed if there is a loss on the sale of the property the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services  – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory and cost of revenues 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and closing costs applicable to the home sales commissions are classified within selling general and administrative expenses the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we test inventory for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the cash flows estimated to be generated by the community are less than its carrying amount such indicators include gross margins or sales paces significantly below expectations construction costs or land development costs significantly in excess of budgeted amounts significant delays or changes in the planned development for the community and other known qualitative factors communities that demonstrate potential impairment indicators are tested for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows for the 

 37 

community to its carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we determine the fair value of the community and impairment charges are recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models are specific to each community due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing the long life cycles of many communities and potential changes in our strategy related to certain communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

estimating the required liability for these potential losses requires a significant level of management judgment during 2015  and 2014  we reduced our loan origination liabilities by net reserve releases of 114 million  and 186 million  respectively based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and existing conditions reserves provided released are reflected in financial services expenses given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

income taxes 

we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence this evaluation considers among other factors historical operating results forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the outlooks for the us housing industry and broader economy the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between estimated and actual results could result in changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the realization of deferred tax assets over time 

 38 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate estimates of the ultimate cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims 

housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims additionally ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs during 2016  and 2015  we reduced general liability reserves by 552 million  and 296 million  respectively as a result of changes in estimates resulting from actual claim experience observed being less than anticipated in previous actuarial projections during 2015  we also recorded a general liability reserve reversal of 326 million  resulting from a legal settlement relating to plumbing claims initially reported to us in 2008 and for which our recorded liabilities were adjusted over time based on changes in facts and circumstances these claims ultimately resulted in a class action lawsuit involving a national vendor and numerous other homebuilders homebuyers and insurance companies in 2015  a global settlement was reached pursuant to which we funded our agreed upon share of settlement costs which were significantly lower than our previously estimated exposure during 2014  we increased general liability insurance reserves by 693 million which was primarily driven by estimated costs associated with siding repairs in certain previously completed communities 

the changes in actuarial estimates in 2016  2015  and 2014  were driven by changes in actual claims experience that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims these changes in actuarial estimates did not involve any changes in actuarial methodology but did impact the development of estimates for future periods which resulted in adjustments to the ibnr portion of our recorded liabilities 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 8311 million  and 9246 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 70  and 74  of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 750 million to 975 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

 39 

in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable our receivables from insurance carriers totaled 3073 million  and 3627 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the insurance receivables relate to costs incurred or to be incurred to perform corrective repairs settle claims with customers and other costs related to the continued progression of both known and anticipated future construction defect claims that we believe to be insured related to previously closed homes we believe collection of these insurance receivables is probable based on the legal merits of our positions after review by legal counsel favorable legal rulings received to date the credit quality of our carriers and our long history of collecting significant amounts of insurance reimbursements under similar insurance policies related to similar claims including significant amounts funded by the above carriers under different policies while the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

we are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates we utilize both fixedrate and variablerate debt for fixedrate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variablerate debt changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay our debt prior to maturity as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt 

the following tables set forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of december 31 2016  and 2015  000’s omitted 



a includes the pulte mortgage repurchase agreement and the term loan which was retired in 2016 does not include our revolving credit facility under which there were no borrowings outstanding at either december 31 2016  or 2015  

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 90  days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we generally enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  residential mortgage loans availableforsale had an aggregate fair value of 5395 million  and 4427 million  respectively at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of 2739 million  and 2082 million  respectively which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment unexpired forward contracts totaled 6100 million  and 5250 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and 

 41 

whole loan investor commitments totaled 1576 million  and 776 million  respectively at such dates hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments

homebuilding operations 



beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market experienced a significant decline in the demand for new homes as well as a sharp decline in overall residential real estate values us new home sales in 2011 were the lowest since 1962 as a result of this industrywide downturn we suffered net losses in each year between 2007  2011 from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments in response to these market conditions we restructured our operations including making significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead costs and managed our business to generate cash including curtailing our investments in inventory we used this positive cash flow to among other things increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt 

in 2012 new home sales in the us increased for the first time since 2005 this trend continued in 2015 as new home sales in the us rose 15  to approximately 501000  homes an approximate 64  increase from 2011 additionally mortgage interest rates remain near historic lows and the overall inventory of homes available for sale especially new homes remains low although current industry volume remains low compared with historical levels the improved environment and the actions we have taken contributed to our return to profitability in 2012 and significant increases in our income before income taxes each year in the period 2013  2015 in the long term we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among the national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover in the shortterm we expect that overall market conditions will continue to improve but that improvements will occur unevenly across our markets our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2015  we had 620  active communities spanning 50  markets across 26  states sales prices of unit closings during 2015  ranged from less than 100000  to greater than 1500000  with 85  falling within the range of 150000  to 500000  the average unit selling price in 2015  was 338000  compared with 329000  in 2014  305000  in 2013  276000  in 2012  and 259000  in 2011  the increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors including improved market conditions and a shift in our sales mix toward moveup and active adult homebuyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 86  in 2015  compared with 86  in 2014  85  in 2013  81  in 2012  and 79  in 2011  the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a shift in our business toward the moveup buyer who tends to prefer detached homes 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 25 billion   6731  units at december 31 2015  and 19 billion   5850  units at december 31 2014  for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2015  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2016  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale to homebuyers we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to targeted consumer groups we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option contracts which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements reduces the financial risk associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we may also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development if we determine that they do not fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is zoned and developed or is ready for development for our intended use in the normal course of business we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2015  we controlled 138079  lots of which 95919  were owned and 42160  were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group through our evaluation of unique consumer groups we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers 



our homes targeted to firsttime buyers tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices or higher density moveup buyers tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults to whom we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area many of these communities are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the age fiftyfive and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than firsttime or moveup buyer communities as illustrated in the above table our sales mix has shifted toward the moveup buyer in recent years this has occurred primarily due to financial challenges facing the firsttime buyer including a recovering us economy the overhang of consumer debt especially student loans related to higher education and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment 

we market our homes to prospective buyers through media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements mobile applications and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays mobile customers in addition our websites wwwpultecom 

 5 

wwwdelwebbcom  and wwwcentexcom  provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us there were approximately 96 million  unique visits to our websites during 2015  compared with approximately 104 million  in 2014  

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in consumerinspired home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants follow a 12step product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency hvac systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

typically our sales teams in some cases together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process fully furnished and landscaped model homes physically located in our communities are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver all aspects of the house construction process 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and by utilizing standard construction practices we are improving our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

the availability of labor and materials at reasonable prices has become an increased concern for certain trades in some markets as the supply chain adjusts to uneven industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future 

 6 

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 3  of us new home sales in 2015  in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rental housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees and suppliers  subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding during 2015  2014  and 2013  we originated mortgage loans for 65  61  and 64  respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 829  in 2015  802  in 2014  802  in 2013  819 in 2012 and 785 in 2011 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time 

 7 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center for our mortgage operations that performs underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a makewhole payment 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the us we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2015  we employed 4542  people of which 749  people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel subject to adherence to our established policies and procedures and our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn from 2006 through 2011 although industry conditions improved beginning in 2012 the overall us economy while improving remains challenged and consumer demand in the industry remains volatile a deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy these conditions contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales as a result of these factors we experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability during the period 2007  2011 we also incurred substantial impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets during this period since 2011 overall industry new home sales have increased and we returned to profitability however the overall demand for new homes remains below historical levels accordingly we can provide no assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials labor shortages in certain of our markets have become more acute in recent quarters as the supply chain adjusts to uneven industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in local and global commodity prices increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs and  or construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in the past we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan to date the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through our mortgage bank interest rates have been near historical lows for several years which has made new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

we also believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the 

 10 

federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for the future development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2015  we had cash and equivalents of 7542 million  restricted cash totaling 213 million  and 3087 million  available under our revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2015  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 1913 million  and 10 billion  respectively these letters of credit are issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the us housing industry is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income for such period 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

as of december 31 2015  we had deferred income tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 15 billion  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 1091 million  the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income and executing tax planning strategies while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities our shareholder rights plan expires june 1 2016 unless our board of directors and shareholders approve an amendment to extend the term prior thereto notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

as a result of our merger with centex in 2009 our ability to use certain of centex’s preownership change nols bils and deductions is limited under section 382 of the irc we do not believe that the section 382 limitation will prevent us from using centexs preownership change federal nols bils or deductions however no assurance can be given that any such limitation will not occur which could be material 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar 

 12 

requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

in january 2013 the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb adopted new rules regarding the origination of mortgages including the criteria for “qualified mortgages” rules for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements such rules went into effect in january 2014 the cfpb also issued the tilarespa integrated disclosure trid rules which combined the mortgage disclosures consumers receive under the truth in lending act tila and the real estate settlement and procedures act respa such rules went into effect in october 2015 while we have adjusted our operations to comply with the new rules the impact such rules will have on our business remains unclear additionally certain other rules required by the doddfrank act of 2010 have not yet been completed or implemented which has created uncertainty in the overall us financial services and mortgage industries as to their longterm impact 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by us policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by us we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative impact on housing demand 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage 

 13 

errors by our associates if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our homebuyers and business partners which could require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

improved demand conditions in the overall us housing market continued through 2015 while heightened global economic concerns have created greater volatility in financial markets the positive trends in the us regarding jobs demographics and household formations low interest rates and a generally balanced inventory of homes available for sale support our expectations that housing demand continues to move higher at a measured pace for a number of years these conditions have helped keep monthly mortgage payments affordable relative to historical levels and the rental market this environment contributed to our experiencing relatively stable overall demand in 2015 including 8  growth in net new orders a 2   increase  in home sale revenues to 58 billion  and maintaining gross margins at 233  among the highest annual gross margins reported in the companys history 

the nature of the homebuilding industry results in a lag between when investments made in land acquisition and development yield new community openings and related home closings during 2015 we opened approximately 200 new communities across our existing local markets which represented a sizable increase compared with recent years as a result of increased land investment over the last few years these new communities generally replaced older communities that closed out in 2015 as our overall active community count increased 4  while we have experience opening new communities this volume of new community openings presents a challenge in todays environment where entitlement and land development delays are common the difficult weather conditions in certain parts of the us in the first half of 2015 contributed to that challenge additionally labor constraints in the construction industry have led to delays in home closings which contributed to our closing volume being flat compared with the prior year leveraging our increased land investments we expect to open an even higher number of new communities in 2016 than we did in 2015 which we expect will help our volume to grow in 2016 in addition we acquired substantially all of the assets of jw homes including the brand john wieland homes and neighborhoods in january 2016 which will also contribute to growth in 2016 

our financial position provided flexibility to increase our investments in future communities while also returning funds to shareholders through dividends and expanded share repurchases specifically we accomplished the following in 2015 

 industrywide new home sales continue to pace well below historical averages so we remain optimistic that demand can continue to increase in the coming years we believe the positive factors of an improving economy with rising employment continued low mortgage rates and beneficial longterm demographic trends will continue to support a slow and sustained housing recovery within this environment we remain focused on driving additional gains in construction and asset efficiency to deliver higher returns on invested capital consistent with our positive market view and longterm business strategy we expect to use our capital to support future growth while consistently returning funds to shareholders

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

 22 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2015  were higher  than 2014  by 1305 million  or 2  the increase  was attributable to a 3   increase  in the average selling price while closings remained relatively flat the increase  in average selling price reflects an ongoing shift in our revenue mix toward moveup buyers closing volume was flat as higher net new orders were offset by production delays in certain communities caused by a number of factors including tight labor resources and adverse weather conditions 

home sale revenues for 2014  were higher  than 2013  by 2379 million  or 4  the increase  was attributable to an 8   increase  in the average selling price offset by a 3   decrease  in closings the increase  in average selling price occurred in substantially all of our local markets and reflected a shift in our revenue mix toward moveup and active adult buyers along with improved market conditions that allowed for increased sale prices including higher levels of house options and lot premiums the decrease in closings resulted from the lower net new order volume in 2014 combined with the lower beginning of the year backlog in 2014 compared with the beginning of the year 2013 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 233  in 2015  compared with 233  in 2014  and 205  in 2013  gross margins remain strong relative to historical levels and reflect a combination of factors including shifts in community mix relatively stable pricing conditions in 2015 following improved pricing conditions in 2014 and lower amortized interest costs  24  34  and 47  of home sale revenues in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively offset by higher house construction and land costs the lower amortized interest costs resulted from the reduction in our outstanding debt in recent years gross margins during 2015  and 2014  were also affected by higher land impairments of 73 million  and 39 million  respectively compared with 29 million  in 2013  

land sales 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales had margin contributions of 127 million  108 million  and 99 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 102  118  and 105  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased   780 million  or 12  in 2015  compared with 2014  sga included adjustments to general liability insurance reserves relating to a reversal of 622 million  in 2015  and a charge of 693 million  in 2014  see note 12  additionally we incurred 20 million  and 76 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively of employee severance retention relocation and related costs attributable to the relocation of our corporate headquarters excluding each of these items sga in both dollars and as a percentage of home sale revenues increased for 2015  compared with 2014  this increase in gross overhead dollars in 2015 was primarily due to investments in increased headcount and information systems along with higher costs in conjunction with the opening of approximately 200 new communities 

the gross dollar amount of our sga increased   993 million  or 17  in 2014  compared with 2013  sga included charges totaling 693 million  to increase general liability insurance reserves in 2014  additionally we incurred 76 million  and 150 million  in 2014 and 2013 respectively of employee severance retention relocation and related costs attributable to the relocation of our corporate headquarters the remainder of the increase in gross overhead dollars in 2014 compared with 2013 were primarily due to variable costs related to the higher revenue volume 

 23 

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements miscellaneous expense net includes a charge of 200 million resulting from the applecross matter see note 12  in 2015  and charges of 412 million  in 2013  resulting from a contractual dispute related to a previously completed luxury community 

net new orders 

net new orders increased   8  in 2015  compared with 2014  the increase resulted from improved sales per community combined with selling from a larger number of active communities which increased   4  to 620  at december 31 2015  the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period decreased  slightly in 2015  from 2014  at 14  and 15  respectively ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed increased   15  at december 31 2015  compared with december 31 2014  as measured in units and increased  by 26  over the prior year period as measured in dollars the higher backlog resulted from the higher net new order volume especially in the fourth quarter combined with production delays in certain communities in 2015 caused by a number of factors including tight labor resources and adverse weather conditions the higher average sales price also contributed to the higher backlog dollars 

net new orders decreased   3  in 2014  compared with 2013  primarily as the result of fewer active communities throughout the majority of 2014 the number of active communities increased slightly in 2014 compared with 2013 up 4  to 598  active communities at december 31 2014  though this was primarily due to our acquisition of certain real estate assets from dominion homes in august 2014 see note 1  excluding such assets our active community count actually declined in 2014 as our pace of new community openings lagged the number of community closeouts the cancellation rate was unchanged from 2013  to 2014  at 15  ending backlog units increased   1  at december 31 2014  compared with december 31 2013  and increased   2  as measured in dollars due to the increase in our average selling price 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2015  and 2014  



the number of homes in production at december 31 2015  was 24   higher  compared to december 31 2014  the increase in homes under production was due to a combination of factors including a 4  increase in active communities a 15  increase in ending backlog units and a conscious decision to moderately increase the number of unsold homes under construction spec homes at the end of the year the increase in spec homes reflects our intentions to achieve a more even 

 24 

flow production cycle over the course of 2016 compared with 2015 as part of our inventory management strategy we will continue to maintain reasonable inventory levels relative to demand in each of our markets we continue to focus on maintaining a low level of completed specs final specs though inventory levels tend to fluctuate throughout the year

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  

a includes loan origination reserve releases of 114 million and 186 million in 2015 and 2014  respectively

revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2015   increase d 12  compared with 2014  the increase  resulted from a higher capture rate and higher revenues per loan which were attributable to a higher average loan size combined with a modest improvement in loan pricing the improvement in loan pricing resulted primarily from a spike in mortgage industry refinancing volume in early 2015 which reduced competitive pricing pressures for new originations loan pricing came under more pressure in more recent months as industry refinancing volume receded however the overall pricing environment for new originations remains favorable 

total financial services revenues during 2014   decrease d 11  compared with 2013  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower origination volume resulting from lower home closings in our homebuilding operations combined with lower revenues per loan resulting from increased competitiveness in the mortgage industry that began in 2013 

since 2007 the mortgage industry has experienced a significant overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production adjustable rate mortgages “arms” accounted for 6  of funded loan production in 2015  compared with 11  and 5  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the shifts in arm volume contributed to the higher revenue per loan in 2015 and lower revenue per loan in 2014 as arms generally contain lower margins additionally fixed rate mortgages tend to have higher servicing values 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

during 2015  and 2014  we reduced our loan origination liabilities by 114 million  and 186 million  respectively based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and current conditions noncash changes in reserve levels are reflected in financial services expenses given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates see note 12  in the consolidated financial statements 

income before income taxes 

the increase d income before income taxes for 2015  as compared with 2014  is due to higher origination volume and an increase in revenue per loan the increase in expenses over the prior period is largely a result of an increase in headcount caused by the higher origination volume combined with the impact of changes in loan loss reserves discussed above 

the increased income before income taxes for 2014  as compared with 2013  resulted from the lower loss reserves in 2014 discussed above partially offset by less favorable loan pricing 

 31 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 395  312  and 3964  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the 2015  effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes including changes in valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets and revaluation of deferred tax assets due to state law changes and business operations the 2014  effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance related to certain state deferred tax assets along with the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters the 2013  effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance related to our federal and certain state deferred tax assets 

income tax expense benefit reflects provisions and reversals related to changes to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances totaling 31 million  456 million  and 21 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the 2015 and 2014 adjustments related primarily to certain of our state deferred tax assets as the result of changes in expected future taxable income in certain jurisdictions 

in 2013 we determined that the valuation allowance against substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets was no longer required the principal positive evidence that led to the reversal of the valuation allowance in 2013 included 1 our emergence from a threeyear cumulative loss in 2013 2 the significant positive income we generated during 2012 and 2013 including seven consecutive quarters of pretax income as of december 31 2013 3 continued improvements in 2013 over recent years in other key operating metrics including revenues gross margin and overhead leverage 4 our forecasted future profitability 5 improvement in our financial position and 6 significant evidence that conditions in the us housing industry were more favorable than in recent years and our belief that conditions would continue to be favorable in the future 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings and may determine that modifications to our financing are appropriate 

at december 31 2015  we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 7542 million  senior notes of 16 billion  and borrowings of 5000 million under a term loan we also had restricted cash balances of 213 million  we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a broad portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm deposits and investments we monitor our investments with each bank and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding our financial services debt was 305  at december 31 2015  

we retired 2380 million  2457 million  and 4614 million  of senior notes during 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the 2014 and 2013 retirements occurred prior to the stated maturity dates and resulted in losses totaling 86 million  and 269 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively 

revolving credit facility 

in july 2014 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” maturing in july 2017 the revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of 5000 million  and contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the revolving credit facility to 10 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and may total no more than the greater of i 50 of the size of the facility or ii 3000 million in the aggregate the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the london interbank offered rate or base rate plus an applicable margin as defined at december 31 2015  we had no  borrowings outstanding and 1913 million  of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility 

 32 

the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debttocapitalization ratio as each term is defined in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all covenants outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries 

term loan 

on september 30 2015 we entered into a senior unsecured 5000 million term loan agreement the “term loan” with an initial maturity date of january 3 2017 which can be extended at our option up to 12 months the interest rate on the term loan may be based on either libor or a base rate plus an applicable margin as defined borrowings are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries and the term loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for loans of this type including the same financial covenants as under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all covenants 

limited recourse notes payable 

certain of our local homebuilding operations maintain limited recourse collateralized notes payable with third parties totaling 353 million  at december 31 2015  these notes have maturities ranging up to six  years are collateralized by the applicable land positions to which they relate have no recourse to any other assets and are classified within accrued and other liabilities the stated interest rates on these notes range up to 500  

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the loans are sold in the secondary market which generally occurs within 30 days 

pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” with third party lenders in september 2015  pulte mortgage entered into an amendment to the repurchase agreement that extended the effective date to september 2016  the repurchase agreement was subsequently amended in december 2015 to increase the borrowing capacity to 3100 million  the capacity decreased to 1750 million  on january 19 2016 and increases to 2000 million  on july 29 2016 the purpose for the changes in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally lower volume periods of mortgage origination activity borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage including quantitative thresholds related to net worth net income and liquidity pulte mortgage had 2679 million  and 1402 million  outstanding under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and was in compliance with its covenants and requirements as of such dates 

stock repurchase programs 

in previous years our board of directors authorized and announced a share repurchase program in october 2014 our board of directors approved an increase of 7500 million  to such authorization and a further increase of 3000 million in december 2015 we repurchased 212 million  129 million  and 72 million shares in 2015  2014  and 2013 respectively for a total of 4337 million  2458 million  and 1181 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively at december 31 2015  we had remaining authorization to repurchase 6048 million  of common shares 

dividends 

we reinstated our quarterly cash dividend in july 2013 and subsequently raised the quarterly dividend in both 2014 and 2015 our declared quarterly cash dividends totaled 1179 million  864 million  and 575 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

 33 

cash flows 

operating activities 

our net cash used in operating activities in 2015  was 3481 million  compared with cash provided by operating activities of 3092 million  and 8811 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels our negative cash flow from operations for 2015  was primarily due to an increase in inventories of 9278 million  as the result of a significant increase in land acquisition and development investment combined with a moderate increase in house inventory due to the higher order backlog and an increase in the number of spec homes consistent with our intentions to achieve a more even flow production cycle over the course of 2016 compared with 2015 the increased inventory was offset by our income before income taxes of 8160 million  additionally residential mortgage loans availableforsale increased 1046 million  as the result of an increase in home closings in the month of december compared with the prior year 

our positive cash flow from operations for 2014  was primarily due to our income before income taxes of 6898 million  these cash flows were partially offset in 2014  by a net increase in inventories of 3466 million  and an increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale of 537 million  

 our positive cash flow from operations for 2013 was primarily due to our income before income taxes of 5278 million  combined with a net decrease in inventories of 2651 million  and a reduction of 284 million in residential mortgage loans availableforsale the inventory decrease resulted from a reduction in homes in production and lower land inventory consistent with the decline in the number of active communities while the decrease in residential mortgage loans availableforsale resulted from a decrease in the home closings in the month of december compared with the prior year 

investing activities 

investing activities are generally not a significant source or use of cash for us net cash used in investing activities totaled 309 million  in 2015  compared with 676 million  in 2014  and 460 million  in 2013  the use of cash from investing activities in 2015  was primarily due to capital expenditures as the result of new community openings 

the use of cash from investing activities in 2014  was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from dominion homes see note 1  and 488 million  of capital expenditures related primarily to new community openings and the relocation of our corporate headquarters these cash outflows were partially offset by a 550 million  reduction in the restricted cash related to letters of credit as a result of the revolving credit facility entered into in july 2014 

the use of cash from investing activities in 2013 was primarily due to 289 million  of capital expenditures a 123 million  increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment and a 42 million  increase in the restricted cash we were required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 1597 million  in 2015  compared with 5291 million  and 6596 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the net cash used in financing activities for 2015 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 212 million common shares for 4337 million  under our repurchase authorization payment of 2392 million  to retire senior notes at their scheduled maturity date and payment of 1160 million  in cash dividends these cash outflows were offset by 5000 million of proceeds from the term loan executed in september 2015 and net borrowings of 1276 million  under the repurchase agreement to fund the increase in mortgage loans availableforsale 

during the last three years we significantly reduced our outstanding senior notes through a variety of transactions including scheduled maturities open market repurchases early redemptions as provided within indenture agreements and tender offers completion of these transactions required the use of 2392 million  2506 million  and 4798 million  of cash in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we borrowed an incremental 346 million  under the repurchase agreement during 2014 and repaid 331 million  in 2013 cash used in financing activities for 2014 also reflects dividend payments of 756 million  and the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase authorization for 2530 million  partially offset by funds provided by the issuance of common shares in connection with employee stock option exercises 

 34 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  

  

 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2015  we had 1621 million  of deposits and preacquisition costs of which 105 million  is refundable relating to option agreements to acquire 42160  lots with a remaining purchase price of 20 billion  we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next two years and the remainder thereafter 

at december 31 2015  we had 390 million  of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 172 million  of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2005   2015  

 35 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2015  



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2015  we had outstanding letters of credit of 1913 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 10 billion  at december 31 2015  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2015  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 20 billion  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices 

at december 31 2015  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 164 million  of which our proportionate share was 70 million  of this amount we provided limited recourse guaranties for 02 million  at december 31 2015  see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 36 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1  of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding  – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit on such sale is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed if there is a loss on the sale of the property the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services  – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory and cost of revenues 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

 37 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

estimating the required liability for these potential losses requires a significant level of management judgment during 2015 and 2014 we reduced our loan origination liabilities by 114 million  and 186 million  respectively based on probable settlements of various repurchase requests and current conditions reserves provided released are reflected in financial services expenses given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

intangible assets 

we have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the centex merger completed in 2009 and the del webb merger completed in 2001 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives the carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future cash flows and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists if the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value to date no impairments relating to tradenames have been recorded however if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of the intangible assets changes the related intangible assets may become impaired 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

income taxes 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns judgment 

 38 

is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate an estimate of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable 

housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims additionally ibnr estimates comprise the majority of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses and the timing of such losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs during 2015  we recorded general liability reserve reversals of 326 million  resulting from a legal settlement and 296 million related to changes in our actuarial estimates resulting from favorable claims experience relative to previous actuarial projections during 2014 we increased general liability insurance reserves by 693 million  which was primarily driven by estimated costs associated with siding repairs in certain previously completed communities that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 6921 million  and 7102 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 65  and 72  of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 625 million to 800 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to market risk on our debt instruments primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates we utilize both fixedrate and variablerate debt for fixedrate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variablerate debt changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument but could affect our earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until we are required or elect to refinance or repurchase such debt 

the following tables set forth the principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of december 31 2015  and 2014  000’s omitted 



a includes the pulte mortgage repurchase agreement and the term loan does not include our revolving credit facility under which there were no borrowings outstanding at either december 31 2015 or 2014 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 75  days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we generally enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  residential mortgage loans availableforsale had an aggregate fair value of 4427 million  and 3395 million  respectively at december 31 2015  and 2014  we had aggregate interest rate lock commitments of 2082 million  and 1461 million  respectively which were originated at interest rates prevailing at the date of commitment unexpired forward contracts totaled 5250 million  and 3710 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and 

 40 

whole loan investor commitments totaled 776 million  and 635 million  respectively at such dates hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments

homebuilding operations 



beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market experienced a significant decline in the demand for new homes as well as a sharp decline in overall residential real estate values us new home sales in 2011 were the lowest since 1962 as a result of this industrywide downturn we suffered net losses in each year between 2007  2011 from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments in response to these market conditions we restructured our operations including making significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead costs and managed our business to generate cash including curtailing our investments in inventory we used this positive cash flow to among other things increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt 

in 2012 new home sales in the us increased for the first time since 2005 this trend continued in 2014 as new home sales in the us rose 2  to approximately 435000  homes an approximate 42  increase from 2011 additionally mortgage interest rates remain near historic lows and the overall inventory of homes available for sale especially new homes remains low although current industry volume remains low compared with historical levels the improved environment and the actions we have taken contributed to our return to profitability in 2012 and significant increases in our profitability in 2013 and 2014 in the long term we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among the national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover in the shortterm we expect that overall market conditions will continue to improve but that improvements will occur unevenly across our markets our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2014  we had 598  active communities sales prices of unit closings during 2014  ranged from less than 100000  to greater than 1500000  with 84  falling within the range of 150000  to 500000  the average unit selling price in 2014  was 329000  compared with 305000  in 2013  276000  in 2012  259000  in 2011  and 259000  in 2010  the increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors including improved market conditions and a shift in our sales mix toward moveup and active adult homebuyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 86  in 2014  compared with 85  in 2013  81  in 2012  79  in 2011  and 79  in 2010  the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses condominiums and other attached housing 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 19 billion   5850  units at december 31 2014  and 19 billion   5772  units at december 31 2013  for orders in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2014  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2015  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale to homebuyers we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to targeted consumer groups we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option contracts which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we may also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development if we determine that they do not fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in the normal course of business we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2014  we controlled 130793  lots of which 96220  were owned and 34573  were under land option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group through our portfolio of brands each serving unique consumer groups we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers 



the moveup buyers in our pulte homes communities tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points our centex brand is targeted to entrylevel buyers so these homes tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults our del webb brand offers both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area many of these communities are highly amenitized offering a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the age fiftyfive and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than entrylevel or moveup communities 

we market our homes to prospective buyers through media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements mobile applications and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays mobile customers in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom  and wwwcentexcom  provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us there were approximately 104 million  unique visits to our websites during 2014  compared with approximately 92 million  in 2013  

 5 

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in consumerinspired home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants follow a 12step product development process to introduce new features and technologies based on customervalidated data following this disciplined process results in distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared with existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency hvac systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

typically our sales teams in some cases together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process fully furnished and landscaped model homes are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver all aspects of the house construction process 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we seek to maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices and are improving our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

the availability of labor and materials at reasonable prices is becoming an increasing concern for certain trades and building materials in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating for certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future 

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 4  of us new home sales in 2014  in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of for sale or rent housing units including apartment operators we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

 6 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees and suppliers  subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding during 2014  2013  and 2012  we originated mortgage loans for 61  64  and 67  respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 802  in 2014  802  in 2013  and 819  in 2012  

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center staffed with loan consultants to perform our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

 7 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a makewhole payment historically our overall losses related to this risk were not significant beginning in 2009 however we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the us however we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2014  we employed 4149  people of which 689  people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel subject to adherence to our established policies and procedures and our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn from 2006 through 2011 although industry conditions improved beginning in 2012 the overall us economy while improving remains challenged and consumer demand in the industry remains volatile a deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy these conditions contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales as a result of these factors we experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability during the period 2007  2011 we also incurred substantial impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets during this period since 2011 overall industry new home sales have increased and we returned to profitability however the overall demand for new homes remains below historical levels accordingly we can provide no assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

 9 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in the past we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

to date the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market in addition we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centex’s mortgage operations which ceased loan origination activities in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by centex this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could exceed existing estimates and accruals the repurchase liability we have recorded is estimated based on several factors including the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments the economic environment and other circumstances some of which are beyond our control accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

 10 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through our mortgage bank interest rates have been near historical lows for several years which has made new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

we also believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes represent significant costs of homeownership both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets can experience significant volatility we may need creditrelated liquidity for future growth and development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2014  we had cash and equivalents of 13 billion  as well as restricted cash totaling 164 million  however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2014  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2121 million  and 10 billion  respectively of these amounts outstanding 37 million  of the letters of credit were subject to cashcollateralized agreements while the remaining letters of credit and surety bonds were unsecured the majority of these letters of credit are issued via our unsecured revolving credit facility which contains certain financial covenants and other limitations if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 11 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the us is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income for such period 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlement of audit issues if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

as of december 31 2014  we had deferred income tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 18 billion  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 823 million  the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income and executing tax planning strategies while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

 12 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we have not experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

as a result of our merger with centex in august 2009 our ability to use certain of centex’s preownership change nols bils and deductions is limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code the applicable section 382 limitation is approximately 674 million per year for nols losses realized on builtin loss assets that were sold within 60 months of the ownership change and certain deductions we do not believe that the section 382 limitation will prevent the company from using centexs preownership change nol carryforwards and builtin losses or deductions 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to prior business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our operating earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

in january 2013 the consumer financial protection bureau adopted new rules regarding the origination of mortgages including the criteria for “qualified mortgages” rules for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements such rules went into effect in january 2014 while we have adjusted our operations to comply with the new rules the impact such rules will have on our business remains unclear additionally many other rules required by the doddfrank act of 2010 have not yet been completed or implemented which has created uncertainty in the overall us financial services and mortgage industries as to their longterm impact 

 13 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors our insurance carriers and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative impact on housing demand 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our homebuyers and business partners which could require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

the overall us housing market continues to be influenced by a combination of low interest rates and affordable home prices that have kept monthly mortgage payments affordable relative to historical levels and the rental market this environment has contributed to our experiencing relatively stable overall demand in 2014 on slightly lower unit volumes we generated a 4 increase in home sale revenues to 57 billion we leveraged this growth into a 33 increase in reported pretax income of 635 million for our homebuilding operations by improving gross margins by 280 basis points to 233 amongst the highest annual gross margins reported in the companys history including our financial services operations we realized pretax income growth of 31 to 690 million 

we generated positive cash flow from operations in 2014 due primarily to improved profitability our improved financial position provided additional flexibility to retire debt early and increase our investments in future communities while also returning funds to shareholders through dividends and expanded share repurchases specifically we accomplished the following during 2014 

• proactively reduced our outstanding debt by 2457 million  

 

assuming market conditions remain consistent with our expectations we also expect to continue to invest increasing amounts into our land portfolio following our disciplined capital allocation process our first priority in allocating capital is to invest responsibly in our business and then to return excess funds to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases on a routine and systematic basis by intelligently investing in our business while routinely returning funds to shareholders we are aligning our capital allocation decisions with our value creation strategy and our fundamental goal of increasing longterm total shareholder returns 

we are optimistic heading into 2015 we believe the positive factors of an improving economy with declining energy costs rising employment lower mortgage rates and related fees beneficial longterm demographic trends and a generally healthy supply of inventory will continue to support a slow and sustained housing recovery within this environment we remain focused on driving additional gains in construction and asset efficiency to deliver higher returns on invested capital consistent with our positive market view and longterm business strategy we expect to use our capital to support future growth while consistently returning funds to shareholders

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

 23 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2014  were higher than 2013  by 2379 million  or 4  the increase was attributable to an 8  increase in the average selling price partially offset by a 3  decrease in closings the increase in average selling price occurred in substantially all of our local markets and reflects an ongoing shift in our revenue mix toward moveup and active adult buyers along with improved market conditions that have allowed for increased sale prices including higher levels of house options and lot premiums the decrease in closings resulted from the lower net new order volume in 2014 combined with the lower beginning of the year backlog in 2014 compared with the beginning of the year 2013 the nature of the homebuilding industry results in a lag between when the significant investments we have made in land acquisition and development the last two years yields new community openings and related home closings 

home sale revenues for 2013  were higher than 2012  by 8719 million  or 19  the increase was attributable to an 11  increase in the average selling price combined with an 8  increase in closings the increase in average selling price occurred in substantially all of our local markets and reflects an ongoing shift in our revenue mix toward moveup and active adult buyers and improved market conditions that have allowed for increased sale prices including higher levels of house options and lot premiums the increase in closings reflected improved consumer demand for new homes in the majority of our local markets 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 233  in 2014  compared with 205  in 2013  and 158  in 2012  the gross margin improvement was broadbased as substantially all of our operating divisions experienced higher gross margins in 2014  compared with the prior year periods these improved gross margins reflect a combination of factors including an improved pricing environment contributions from our strategic pricing and house cost reduction initiatives and lower amortized interest costs 34 47 and 49 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the lower amortized interest costs resulted from a significant reduction in our outstanding debt in recent years gross margins during 2014  and 2013  also benefited from lower land impairments of 39 million  and 29 million  respectively compared with 134 million  in 2012  

land sales

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with either third parties or with the company substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  



 31 

revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2014  decreased 11  compared with 2013  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower origination volume resulting from lower home closings in our homebuilding operations combined with lower revenues per loan resulting from the increased competitiveness in the mortgage industry that began in 2013 

total financial services revenues during 2013  decreased 12  compared with 2012  the decrease was primarily due to lower revenues per loan resulting from the increased competitiveness in the mortgage industry that occurred in 2013 the decline in revenues per loan more than offset the higher origination volume interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was moderately higher in 2013  than in 2012  due to the increase in loan originations 

in recent years the mortgage industry has experienced a significant overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production adjustable rate mortgages “arms” accounted for 11  of funded loan production in 2014  compared with 5  and 3  in 2013  and 2012  respectively the shift toward arms has contributed to lower profitability as arms generally contain lower margins additionally fixed rate mortgages tend to have higher servicing values beginning in 2013 competition increased in the industry partially as the result of the mortgage industrys lower refinancing volume we expect this increased level of competition and more challenging pricing environment to continue for the foreseeable future 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

during 2014 we reduced our loan origination liabilities by 186 million  based on settlements of various pending repurchase requests and current conditions during 2012  we recorded 490 million of provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates reserves provided and related adjustments are reflected in financial services expenses given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates see note 12  in the consolidated financial statements 

the mortgage subsidiary of centex also sold loans to a bank for inclusion in residential mortgagebacked securities “rmbss” issued by the bank in connection with these sales centexs mortgage subsidiary entered into agreements pursuant to which it may be required to indemnify the bank for losses incurred by investors in the rmbss arising out of material errors or omissions in certain information provided by the mortgage subsidiary relating to the loans and loan origination process in 2011 the bank notified us that it has been named defendant in two lawsuits alleging various violations of federal and state securities laws asserting that untrue statements of material fact were included in the registration statements used to market the sale of two rmbs transactions see note 12  in the consolidated financial statements 

income before income taxes 

the increased income before income taxes for 2014  as compared with 2013  resulted from lower loss reserves related to loans originated in previous years partially offset by less favorable loan pricing 

the increased income before income taxes for 2013  as compared with 2012  was due to higher origination volumes and lower loss reserves related to loans originated in previous years partially offset by less favorable loan pricing 

 32 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors the most significant of which are the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets changes in tax laws or other circumstances that impact the value of our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits due to the effects of these factors our effective tax rates in 2014  2013  and 2012  are not correlated to the amount of our income before income taxes income tax expense for 2014  reflects a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance primarily related to certain of our state deferred tax assets along with the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters the income tax benefit for 2013  resulted from the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance related to our federal deferred tax assets and certain of our state deferred tax assets while the income tax benefit for 2012  resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters 

we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence 

our income tax expense benefit for 2014 and 2013 included benefits of 456 million  and 21 billion  respectively related to reversals of valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets the 2014 reversal related primarily to certain of our state deferred tax assets as the result of an increase in expected future taxable income in certain jurisdictions in 2013 we determined that the valuation allowance against substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets was no longer required the principal positive evidence that led to the reversal of the valuation allowance in 2013 included 1 our emergence from a threeyear cumulative loss in 2013 2 the significant positive income we generated during 2012 and 2013 including seven consecutive quarters of pretax income as of december 31 2013 3 continued improvements in 2013 over recent years in other key operating metrics including revenues gross margin and overhead leverage 4 our forecasted future profitability 5 improvement in our financial position and 6 significant evidence that conditions in the us housing industry are more favorable than in recent years and our belief that conditions will continue to be favorable over the longterm 

after careful evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence and giving more weight to objectively verifiable evidence over more subjective evidence we concluded as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets would be realized even if industry conditions weaken from current levels we believe we will be able to adjust our operations to sustain longterm profitability 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations by using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate 

at december 31 2014  we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 13 billion  and senior notes of 18 billion  we also had restricted cash balances of 164 million  other financing sources include an unsecured revolving credit facility a separate letter of credit agreement and surety bond arrangements 

we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm investments including money market funds and federal government or agency securities we monitor our investments with each bank and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding our financial services debt was 275  at december 31 2014  

 33 

during 2014  we retired prior to their scheduled maturity dates 2457 million  of senior notes we recorded losses related to these transactions totaling 86 million  losses on these transactions included the writeoff of unamortized discounts premiums and transaction fees and are reflected in other expense net during 2013  and 2012  we retired senior notes totaling 4614 million  and 5924 million  respectively 

revolving credit facility 

in july 2014 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” maturing in july 2017 the revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of 500 million  and contains an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the revolving credit facility to 10 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit that reduce available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and may total no more than the greater of i 50 of the size of the facility or ii 300 million in the aggregate the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the london interbank offered rate or base rate plus an applicable margin as defined at december 31 2014  we had no  borrowings outstanding and 2084 million  of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility 

the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debttocapitalization ratio as each term is defined in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all covenants outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries 

limited recourse notes payable 

we maintain limited recourse collateralized notes payable with third parties totaling 223 million  and 75 million  at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively these notes have maturities ranging up to 6  years are collateralized by the applicable land positions to which they relate have no recourse to any other assets and are classified within accrued and other liabilities 

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties or through intercompany borrowings pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market which generally occurs within 30 days 

pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” with third party lenders in september 2014  pulte mortgage entered into an amendment to the repurchase agreement that extended the effective date to september 2015  and established a borrowing capacity of 1500 million  the capacity will reduce to 998 million  in february 2015  and will increase again to 1500 million  in june 2015  the purpose for the change in capacity during the term of the agreement is to lower associated fees during seasonally low volume periods when the additional capacity is unnecessary borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage including quantitative thresholds related to net worth net income and liquidity pulte mortgage had 1402 million  and 1057 million  outstanding under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively and was in compliance with all of its covenants and requirements 

stock repurchase programs 

in previous years our board of directors authorized and announced a share repurchase program in october 2014 our board of directors approved an increase of 7500 million  to such authorization we repurchased 129 million  and 72 million  shares under the repurchase authorization for a total of 2458 million  and 1181 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively there were no repurchases under these programs during 2012  at december 31 2014  we had remaining authorization to repurchase 7385 million  of common shares 

 34 

dividends 

we reinstated our quarterly cash dividend in july 2013 during 2013 we declared three cash dividends of 005 per common share each during 2014 we declared cash dividends of 005  per common share in each of the first three quarters and 008  per common share in the fourth quarter for a total of 864 million  

cash flows 

operating activities 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2014  was 3092 million  compared with 8811 million  and 7601 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels our positive cash flow from operations for 2014 was primarily due to our income before income taxes of 6898 million  these cash flows were partially offset in 2014 by a net increase in inventories of 3466 million  as the result of an almost 40 increase in investment spending over the prior year to support future operations additionally residential mortgage loans availableforsale increased 537 million  as the result of an increase in home closings in the month of december compared with the prior year 

our positive cash flow from operations for 2013 was primarily due to our income before income taxes of 5278 million  combined with a net decrease in inventories of 2651 million  and a reduction of 284 million  in residential mortgage loans availableforsale the inventory decrease resulted from a reduction in homes in production and lower land inventory consistent with the decline in the number of our active communities while the decrease in residential mortgage loans availableforsale resulted from a decrease in the home closings in the month of december compared with the prior year 

 our positive cash flow from operations for 2012 was primarily due to our net income of 2061 million  combined with a net decrease in inventories of 4552 million  the inventory decrease resulted from lower reinvestment in land inventory combined with a significant reduction in spec homes in production partially offset by an increase in sold homes in production 

investing activities 

investing activities are generally not a significant source or use of cash for us net cash used in investing activities totaled 676 million  in 2014  compared with 460 million  in 2013  and net cash provided by investing activities of 97 million  in 2012  the use of cash from investing activities in 2014  was primarily due to the acquisition of certain real estate assets from dominion homes see note 1  additionally capital expenditures increased in 2014  as the result of new community openings and the relocation of our corporate headquarters these cash outflows were partially offset by a 550 million  reduction in restricted cash related to letters of credit as a result of the revolving credit facility entered into in july 2014 

the use of cash from investing activities in 2013  was primarily due to 289 million  of capital expenditures a 123 million  increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment and a 42 million  increase in the restricted cash we were required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities 

the positive cash flow from investing activities in 2012 was primarily due to a 287 million  decrease in the restricted cash we are required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities which resulted from a reduction in letters of credit outstanding offset by capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated entities 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5291 million  in 2014  compared with net cash used of 6596 million  and 4482 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively during the last three years we significantly reduced our outstanding senior notes through a variety of transactions including scheduled maturities open market repurchases early redemptions as provided within indenture agreements and tender offers completion of these transactions required the use of 2506 million  4798 million  and 6188 million  of cash in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we borrowed an incremental 346 million  under the repurchase agreement during 2014 repaid 331 million  of borrowings in 2013 and borrowed 1388 million  in 2012 the year in which it was put in place cash used in financing activities for 2014 also reflects dividend payments of 756 million  and the repurchase of common shares for 2530 million  partially offset by funds provided by the issuance of common shares in connection with employee stock option exercises 

 35 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again we historically experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry we generally experience increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements in our third and fourth quarters to support our home production and loan origination volumes as a result of the seasonality of our operations our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  

  

 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2014  we had 1273 million  of deposits and preacquisition costs relating to option agreements to acquire 34573  lots with a remaining purchase price of 19 billion  we expect to acquire the majority of such land within the next two years and the remainder thereafter 

at december 31 2014  we had 329 million  of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 173 million  of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2004   2014  

 36 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2014  



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2014  we had outstanding letters of credit of 2121 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 10 billion  at december 31 2014  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2014  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 19 billion  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices in certain instances we are required to record the land under option as if we own it at december 31 2014  we recorded assets of 302 million  as land not owned under option agreements 

at december 31 2014  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 258 million  of which our proportionate share was 116 million  of this amount we provided limited recourse guaranties for 03 million  at december 31 2014  see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1  of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding  – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit on such sale is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed if there is a loss on the sale of the property the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services  – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

 38 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

because we generally do not retain the servicing rights to the loans we originate information regarding the current and historical performance credit quality and outstanding balances of such loans is limited estimating these loan origination liabilities is further complicated by uncertainties surrounding numerous external factors such as various macroeconomic factors including unemployment rates and changes in home prices actions taken by third parties including the parties servicing the loans and the us federal government in its dual capacity as regulator of the us mortgage industry and conservator of the governmentsponsored enterprises commonly known as fannie mae and freddie mac which own or guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the us most requests received to date relate to makewhole payments on loans that have been foreclosed requests undergo extensive analysis to confirm the exposure attempt to cure the identified defect and when necessary determine our liability we establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon among other things the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase determining these estimates and the resulting liability requires a significant level of management judgment 

during 2014 we reduced our loan origination liabilities by 186 million  based on settlements of various pending repurchase requests and current conditions during 2012  we recorded 490 million of provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates reserves provided and related adjustments are reflected in financial services expenses given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

intangible assets 

we have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the centex merger completed in 2009 and the del webb merger completed in 2001 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives the carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists if the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value to date no impairments relating to tradenames have been recorded however if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of the intangible assets changes the related intangible assets may become impaired 

 39 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

selfinsured risks 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and periodically evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate an estimate of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable 

during 2014 we recorded a change in estimate increasing general liability insurance reserves by 693 million  such additional reserves were primarily driven by estimated costs associated with siding repairs in certain previously completed communities that in turn impacted actuarial estimates for potential future claims adjustments to reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves additionally the amount of insurance coverage available for each policy period also impacts our recorded reserves costs associated with our insurance programs are classified within selling general and administrative expenses 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 7102 million  and 6681 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 72  and 78  of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 650 million to 825 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

income taxes 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 40 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financings to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value 000’s omitted 



derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 75  days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float in periods of low or decreasing interest rates the length of exposure will also generally increase as customers desire to lock before the possibility of rising rates 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results due to the offsetting nature in the movements in fair value of our financial instruments

internal control over financial reporting 

 

management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed 

management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation additionally because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

in order to ensure that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of december 31 2014  management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework on august 22 2014 the company completed the acquisition of certain real estate assets from dominion homes as permitted by the securities and exchange commission management excluded the operations related to such assets from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 such operations constituted approximately 105 million of consolidated total assets as of december 31 2014 and 74 million of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended based on this assessment management asserts that the company has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014

the board of directors and shareholders of pultegroup inc 

we have audited pultegroup inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria pultegroup inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of certain real estate assets acquired from dominion homes on august 22 2014 which are included in the 2014 consolidated financial statements of pultegroup inc and constituted 105 million of consolidated total assets as of december 31 2014 and 74 million of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of pultegroup inc also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the operations of certain real estate assets acquired from dominion homes 

in our opinion pultegroup inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of pultegroup inc as of december 31 2014  and 2013  and the related consolidated statements of operations comprehensive income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014  and our report dated february 4 2015  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

homebuilding operations 



beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market experienced a significant decline in the demand for new homes as well as a sharp decline in overall residential real estate values us new home sales in 2011 were the lowest since 1962 as a result of this industrywide downturn we suffered net losses in each year between 2007  2011 from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments in response to these market conditions we restructured our operations including making significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead costs and managed our business to generate cash including curtailing our investments in inventory we used this positive cash flow to among other things increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt 

in 2012 new home sales in the us increased for the first time since 2005 in 2013 this trend continued as new home sales in the us rose 16  to approximately 428000  homes an approximate 40  increase from the bottom of the housing cycle in 2011 additionally mortgage interest rates remain near historic lows and the overall inventory of homes available for sale especially new homes remains low although current industry volume remains low compared with historical levels the improved environment and the actions we have taken contributed to our return to profitability in 2012 and a significant increase in our profitability in 2013 in the long term we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among the national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover in the shortterm we expect that overall market conditions will continue to improve but that improvements will occur unevenly across our markets our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2013  we had 577  active communities sales prices of unit closings during 2013  ranged from less than 100000  to greater than 1200000  with 86  falling within the range of 100000  to 450000  the average unit selling price in 2013  was 305000  compared with 276000  in 2012  259000  in 2011  259000  in 2010  and 258000  in 2009  the increase in average selling price in recent years resulted from a number of factors including improved market conditions and a shift in our sales mix toward moveup and active adult homebuyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 85  in 2013  compared with 81  in 2012  79  in 2011  79  in 2010  and 77  in 2009  the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses condominiums and other attached housing as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for entrylevel and active adult homebuyers 

 4 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 19 billion   5772  units at december 31 2013  and 19 billion   6458  units at december 31 2012  for each order in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2013  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2014  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale to homebuyers we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to targeted consumer groups we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option contracts which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment we may also periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development additionally we may determine that certain land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans 

land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in the normal course of business we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2013  we controlled 123478  lots of which 95212  were owned and 28266  were under option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group through our portfolio of brands each serving unique consumer groups we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers 



the moveup buyers in our pulte homes communities tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points our centex brand is targeted to entrylevel buyers and these homes tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults our del webb brand offers both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these highly amenitized communities offer a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the age fiftyfive and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be larger than entrylevel or moveup communities

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to deliver all aspects of the house construction process 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices beginning in 2011 we implemented an intensive effort to improve our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

the availability of labor and materials at reasonable prices is becoming an increasing concern for certain trades and building materials in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed with customers in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future

competition 

the housing industry in the us is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only approximately 4  of us new home sales in 2013  in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales have traditionally represented less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of housing units for sale or to rent including apartment operators may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues profitability and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings while the challenging market conditions experienced in recent years lessened the seasonal variations of our results we have experienced a return to a more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year if and when the homebuilding industry more fully recovers from the recent downturn we believe these traditional seasonal patterns will continue 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing and title operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees and suppliers  subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding during 2013  2012  and 2011  we originated mortgage loans for 64  67  and 61  respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 802  in 2013  819  in 2012  and 785  in 2011  

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time 

 7 

the mortgage industry in the us is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center staffed with loan consultants to perform our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a makewhole payment historically our overall losses related to this risk were not significant beginning in 2009 however we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents and underwriters in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the us however we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2013  we employed 3843  people of which 709  people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn in recent years although industry conditions improved during 2012 and 2013 the overall us economy while improving remains challenged and consumer demand in the industry remains volatile a deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011 the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy these conditions contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales as a result of these factors we experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability during the period 2007  2011 we also incurred substantial impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets during this period during 2012 and 2013 overall industry new home sales increased and we returned to profitability however the overall demand for new homes remains below historical levels accordingly we can provide no assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

 9 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in the past we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

to date the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market in 2006 and 2007 we originated 395 billion of loans excluding loans originated by centexs former subprime loan business sold by centex in 2006 

in addition we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centex’s mortgage operations which ceased loan origination activities in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by centex this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could exceed existing estimates and accruals the repurchase liability we have recorded is estimated based on several factors including the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments the economic environment and other circumstances some of which are beyond our control accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

 10 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or other increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through our mortgage bank interest rates have been near historical lows for several years which has made new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing however could adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

we also believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes the fha has and may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards raise minimum down payment requirements impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs andor limit the number of mortgages it insures the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years in many cases the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers we may need creditrelated liquidity for future growth and development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2013  we had cash and equivalents of 16 billion  as well as restricted cash totaling 727 million  however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2013  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 1831 million  and 9583 million  respectively of these amounts outstanding 587 million  of the letters of credit were subject to cashcollateralized agreements while the remaining letters of credit and surety bonds were unsecured if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 11 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the us is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position cash flows or net income for such period 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position cash flows and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

as of december 31 2013  we had deferred income tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 22 billion  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 1573 million  the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income and executing tax planning strategies while we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowances are subject to change as facts and circumstances change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

 12 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we have not experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

as a result of the merger with centex in august 2009 our ability to use certain of centex’s preownership change nols bils and deductions is limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code the applicable section 382 limitation is approximately 674 million per year for nols losses realized on builtin loss assets that are sold within 60 months of the ownership change ie before august 2014 and certain deductions we do not believe that the section 382 limitation will prevent the company from using centexs preownership change nol carryforwards and builtin losses or deductions 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to prior business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our operating earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

in january 2013 the consumer financial protection bureau adopted new rules regarding the origination of mortgages including the criteria for “qualified mortgages” rules for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements such rules went into effect in january 2014 while we have adjusted our operations to comply with the new rules the impact such rules will have on our business remains unclear additionally many other rules required by the doddfrank act of 2010 have not yet been completed or implemented which has created uncertainty in the overall us financial services and mortgage industries as to their longterm impact 

 13 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our subcontractors and our and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative impact on housing demand 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our homebuyers and business partners which could require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

future terrorist attacks against the us or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the us could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the us or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

the underlying trends in us housing point toward an ongoing multiyear recovery supported by favorable demographics an improving economy mortgage interest rates near historic lows and limited supplies of new and existing home inventories our results in 2013 showed significant improvement in the majority of our key operating metrics in the first half of the year while demand conditions slowed for us in the second half of the year as consumers adjusted to higher home prices and a moderate rise in mortgage interest rates for the full year 2013 the overall improvement in market conditions in concert with our own tactical actions contributed to our seventh consecutive profitable quarter home closings revenues average selling price inventory turns gross margin overhead leverage and income before income taxes all improved in 2013 compared with 2012 

our net new orders declined 10  in 2013 compared with 2012 a lower number of active communities contributed to the decline in net new orders as we maintained 14  fewer active communities in 2013 compared with 2012 the lower active community count resulted from the closeout of a number of longterm projects and is consistent with our more disciplined land investment strategy in addition demand slowed in the second half of 2013 in response to higher home prices and a rise in mortgage interest rates we will continue to calibrate sales pace in each community to improve our gross margins and maximize returns on invested capital we expect that this approach will continue to result in a moderation in our net new order volume in the shortterm relative to overall growth in the us homebuilding industry and relative to certain of our competitors while we believe higher mortgage interest rates are inevitable and may have a moderating effect on demand and pricing we believe this impact will be outweighed in the longterm by other factors driving increased sales volume as overall new home sales in the us remain low compared with historical levels 

the significant improvements reported for 2013 also allowed us to continue to enhance our financial position we generated significant positive cash flow from operations in each of the last two years via a combination of improved profitability and inventory management our improved financial position provided additional flexibility to retire debt early and increase our planned future investments in new communities while also paying a dividend and selectively repurchasing our common shares specifically we accomplished the following during 2013 

 

in the shortterm we will continue to focus on maximizing our operating margins despite the possibility of rising house cost pressures from material and labor prices by using our existing land assets more effectively allocating capital more effectively and aggressively controlling unsold spec inventory to enhance our balance sheet we believe we have positioned ourselves to deliver improved longterm returns in planning for the longer term we continue to maintain confidence that we are in the early stages of a broad sustainable recovery in the us new home market while the us macroeconomic environment continues to face challenges and each local market will experience varying results we are continuing to pursue strategic land positions that meet our underwriting requirements in wellpositioned submarkets and believe that sustained execution of our strategy will continue to result in increased profits and improved returns on invested capital over the housing cycle

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income loss before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

 23 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2013 were higher than 2012 by 8719 million  or 19  the increase was attributable to an 11  increase in the average selling price combined with an 8  increase in closings the increase in average selling price occurred in substantially all of our local markets and reflects an ongoing shift in our revenue mix toward moveup and active adult buyers and improved market conditions that have allowed for increased sale prices including higher levels of house options and lot premiums the increase in closings reflected improved consumer demand for new homes in the majority of our local markets 

home sale revenues for 2012 were higher than 2011 by 6017 million  or 15  the increase was attributable to a 7  increase in the average selling price combined with an 8  increase in closings the increase in average selling price reflected a shift in our revenue mix toward moveup and active adult buyers and improved market conditions the increase in closings was concentrated primarily in our north and southwest segments 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 205  in 2013  compared with 158  in 2012  and 128  in 2011  gross margins during 2013  and 2012  benefited from lower land impairments of 29 million  and 134 million  respectively compared with 159 million  in 2011  excluding the impact of land impairments and capitalized interest amortization adjusted home sale gross margins improved to 252  in 2013  from 209  in 2012  and 179  in 2011  see the nongaap financial measures section for a reconciliation of adjusted home sale gross margins the gross margin improvement was broadbased as substantially all of our operating divisions experienced higher gross margins in 2013  compared with the prior year periods these improved gross margins reflect a combination of factors including an improved pricing environment shifts in the product mix of homes closed toward moveup and active adult buyers better alignment of our product offering with consumer demand and contributions from our strategic pricing and house cost reduction initiatives 

land sales 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales had margin contributions of 99 million  118 million  and 236 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively these margin contributions included net realizable value adjustments related to land held for sale totaling 36 million  15 million  and 98 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

sga 

sga as a percentage of home sale revenues dropped to 105  in 2013  from 113  in 2012  and 132  in 2011  the gross dollar amount of our sga increased 540 million  or 11  in 2013  compared with 2012  sga includes 150 million  of employee severance retention relocation and related costs attributable to our previously announced relocation of our corporate headquarters the remaining increases in gross overhead dollars were primarily due to variable costs related to the higher revenue volume combined with higher incentive compensation accruals resulting from the companys improved operating performance 

the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased 51 million  or 1  in 2012  compared with 2011  due to improved overhead leverage partially offset by higher incentive compensation resulting from our improved operating results 

equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities 

equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities was 10 million  39 million  and 32 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures as a result the timing of income and losses varies between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity 

  

 24 

other expense net 

other expense net includes the following 000’s omitted 



for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements miscellaneous expense net includes charges of 412 million  in 2013 resulting from a contractual dispute related to a previously completed luxury community and 51 million  in 2012 and 171 million  in 2011 related to the writedown of notes receivable 

interest income net 

interest income net for 2013 decreased from the prior year based on the level of invested cash balances and low returns on invested cash available in the current interest rate environment 

net new orders 

net new orders decreased 10  in 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to selling from 14  fewer active communities in 2013  577  at december 31 2013  combined with slowed demand in the second half of 2013 in response to higher home prices and a rise in mortgage interest rates the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period was unchanged from 2012 to 2013 at 15  ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed decreased 11  at december 31 2013  compared with december 31 2012  due to the decrease in net new orders but only decreased by 2  over the prior year period as measured in dollars due to the increase in our average selling price 

net new order levels increased 25  in 2012 compared with 2011 while selling from 4  fewer active communities in 2012 we had 670  active communities at december 31 2012  the cancellation rate was 15  in 2012 compared with 19  in 2011 ending backlog units increased 65  at december 31 2012  compared with december 31 2011  due to the decrease in net new orders 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2013  and 2012  



the number of homes in production at december 31 2013  was 10  lower than at december 31 2012  the reduced level of homes in production is consistent with our lower active community count and our inventory management strategies reducing our reliance on sales of spec homes is a component of our strategic pricing and inventory turns objectives so we have focused on reducing the level of our spec home inventory especially our completed specs final specs 

 25 

controlled lots 

the following is a summary of our lots under control at december 31 2013  and 2012  



of our controlled lots 95212  and 103060  were owned and 28266  and 16815  were under land option agreements at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively while competition for wellpositioned land has increased we 

continue to pursue strategic land positions that meet our underwriting requirements while also using our existing land assets more effectively 

the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 14 billion  at december 31 2013  these land option agreements which generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years are secured by deposits and preacquisition costs totaling 910 million  of which only 45 million  is refundable

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information about our home sale gross margins reflecting certain adjustments this measure is considered a nongaap financial measure under the secs rules and should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the comparable gaap financial measure as a measure of our operating performance management and our local divisions use this measure in evaluating the operating performance of each community and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing construction and development pace product mix and other daily operating decisions we believe it is a relevant and useful measures to investors for evaluating our performance through gross profit generated on homes delivered during a given period and for comparing our operating performance to other companies in the homebuilding industry although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information the methods used may differ we urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate gross margins and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measure to that of such other companies 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to the gaap financial measure that management believes to be most directly comparable 000s omitted

 31 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with either third parties or with the company substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we also sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the business levels of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  



 32 

revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2013  decreased 12  compared with 2012  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues per loan resulting from the increased competitiveness in the mortgage industry that occurred in 2013 the decline in revenues per loan more than offset the higher loan origination volume interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was moderately higher in 2013  than in 2012  due to the increase in loan originations 

total financial services revenues during 2012  increased 56  compared with 2011  due to a 19  increase in loan origination volumes an increase in average loan size and improved loan pricing the increase in loan origination volumes was due to a higher capture rate higher homebuilding closing volumes and fewer cash sales interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was moderately higher in 2012   than in 2011  due to the increase in loan originations 

in recent years the mortgage industry has experienced a significant overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production and fixed rate loans versus adjustable rate mortgages “arms” and unconventional loans the substantial majority of loan production during 2013  2012  and 2011  consisted of fixed rate loans the majority of which are prime conforming loans the shift toward agency fixedrate loans has contributed to profitability as such loans generally result in higher profitability due to higher servicing values and structured guidelines that allow for expense efficiencies when processing the loan additionally historically low interest rates and the challenging regulatory environment has contributed to profitability by reducing the overall level of pricing competition in the market recently however competition has increased in the industry partially as the result of the mortgage industrys lower refinancing volume we expect this increased level of competition and more challenging pricing environment to continue for the foreseeable future 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

in recent years we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market during 2012  and 2011  we recorded additional provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates losses related to loan origination liabilities totaled 490 million  and 593 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively and are reflected in financial services expenses there were no  such losses in 2013  given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates see our critical accounting policies and estimates  and note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centexs mortgage operations which ceased loan origination activities in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by centex this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centexs mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans other than with respect to this pool of loans our contractual repurchase obligations are limited to our mortgage subsidiaries which are included in nonguarantor subsidiaries see note 14  for a discussion of nonguarantor subsidiaries 

 33 

the mortgage subsidiary of centex also sold loans to a bank for inclusion in residential mortgagebacked securities “rmbss” issued by the bank in connection with these sales centexs mortgage subsidiary entered into agreements pursuant to which it may be required to indemnify the bank for losses incurred by investors in the rmbss arising out of material errors or omissions in certain information provided by the mortgage subsidiary relating to the loans and loan origination process in 2011 the bank notified us that it has been named defendant in two lawsuits alleging various violations of federal and state securities laws asserting that untrue statements of material fact were included in the registration statements used to market the sale of two rmbs transactions which included 162 million  of loans originated by centexs mortgage subsidiary neither centexs mortgage subsidiary nor the company is named as a defendant in these actions we cannot yet quantify centexs mortgage subsidiarys potential liability as a result of these indemnification obligations we do not believe however that these matters will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company we are aware of six other rmbs transactions with similar indemnity provisions that include an aggregate 116 million  of loans and we are not aware of any current or threatened legal proceedings regarding those transactions 

income before income taxes 

the increased income before income taxes for 2013  as compared with 2012  was due to higher origination volumes and lower loss reserves related to loans originated in previous years partially offset by less favorable loan pricing 

the income before income taxes for 2012  as compared with the loss before income taxes in the prior year period was due to higher origination volumes improved loan pricing and lower loss reserves related to loans originated in previous years 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors the most significant of which are the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits due to the effects of these factors our effective tax rates in 2013  2012  and 2011  are not correlated to the amount of our income or loss before income taxes the income tax benefit for 2013  resulted from the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets while the income tax benefits for 2012  and 2011  resulted primarily from the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters 

we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods we conduct our evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence 

our income tax benefit for 2013  includes 21 billion  related to the reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2013 we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and determined that the valuation allowance against substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets was no longer required when a change in valuation allowance is recognized in an interim period a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed must be allocated to the remaining interim periods accordingly a portion of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2013 the components of the valuation allowance remaining at december 31 2013  relate primarily to state net operating losses that have not met the more likely than not realization threshold 

the principal positive evidence that led to the reversal of the valuation allowance in 2013  included 1 our emergence from a threeyear cumulative loss in 2013 2 the significant positive income we generated during 2012 and 2013 including seven consecutive quarters of pretax income as of december 31 2013 3 continued improvements in 2013 over recent years in other key operating metrics including revenues gross margin and overhead leverage 4 our forecasted future profitability 5 improvement in our financial position and 6 significant evidence that conditions in the us housing industry are more favorable than in recent years and our belief that conditions will continue to be favorable over the longterm the following provides a further summary of the principal evidence considered in 2013  

  

 

 34 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after careful evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence and giving more weight to objectively verifiable evidence over more subjective evidence we concluded as of september 30 2013 and again as of december 31 2013  that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our federal deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our state deferred tax assets would be realized even if industry conditions weaken from current levels we believe we will be able to adjust our operations to sustain longterm profitability 

 35 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations by using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate 

at december 31 2013  we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 16 billion  and senior notes of 21 billion  we also had restricted cash balances of 727 million  the substantial majority of which related to cash serving as collateral under certain letter of credit facilities other financing sources include various letter of credit facilities and surety bond arrangements 

we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm investments generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities we monitor our investments with each bank and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding our financial services debt was 307  at december 31 2013  and 80  net of cash and equivalents including restricted cash 

during 2013  we retired prior to their scheduled maturity dates 4614 million  of senior notes we recorded losses related to these transactions totaling 269 million  losses on these transactions included the writeoff of unamortized discounts premiums and transaction fees and are reflected in other expense net during 2012  and 2011 we retired senior notes totaling 5924 million  and 3239 million  respectively 

credit agreements 

we maintain separate cashcollateralized letter of credit agreements with a number of financial institutions letters of credit totaling 587 million  were outstanding under these agreements at december 31 2013  under these agreements we are required to maintain deposits with these financial institutions in amounts approximating the letters of credit outstanding such deposits are included in restricted cash 

we also maintain an unsecured letter of credit facility that expires in september 2014  this facility permits the issuance of up to 1500 million  of letters of credit for general corporate purposes in support of any whollyowned subsidiary letters of credit totaling 1244 million  were outstanding under this facility at december 31 2013  

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties or through intercompany borrowings pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market which generally occurs within 30 days 

pulte mortgage maintains a master repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” with third party lenders that expires in september 2014  effective january 2014 pulte mortgage voluntarily reduced the borrowing capacity under the repurchase agreement from 1500 million  to 998 million  subject to certain sublimits we reduced the borrowing capacity in order to lower associated fees during seasonally low volume periods when the additional capacity is unnecessary borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants applicable to pulte mortgage including quantitative thresholds related to net worth net income and liquidity at december 31 2013  pulte mortgage had 1057 million  outstanding under the repurchase agreement and was in compliance with all of its covenants and requirements while there can be no assurances that the repurchase agreement can be renewed or replaced on commercially reasonable terms upon its expiration we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet pulte mortgages anticipated financing needs 

 36 

stock repurchase programs 

in july 2013 we increased our common share repurchase authorization to 3523 million  of common shares in 2013  we repurchased 72 million  shares under the repurchase authorization for a total of 1181 million  there were no  repurchases under these programs during 2012  or 2011  such repurchases are reflected as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings at december 31 2013  we had remaining authorization to purchase 2343 million   of common shares 

dividends 

we reinstated our quarterly cash dividend in july 2013 during 2013 we declared three cash dividends of 005 per common share each

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2013  was 8811 million  compared with 7601 million  and 173 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels our positive cash flow from operations for 2013 was primarily due to our income before income taxes of 5278 million  combined with a net decrease in inventories of 2651 million  and a reduction of 284 million  in residential mortgage loans availableforsale the inventory decrease resulted from a reduction in homes in production and lower land inventory consistent with the decline in the number of our active communities 

 our positive cash flow from operations for 2012 was primarily due to our net income of 2061 million  combined with a net decrease in inventories of 4552 million  the inventory decrease resulted from lower reinvestment in land inventory combined with a significant reduction in spec homes in production partially offset by an increase in sold homes in production 

the net losses for 2011 were largely the result of noncash asset impairments and insurance reserve adjustments so the cash flows from operations primarily related to changes in working capital our positive cash flow from operations in 2011 was primarily the result of a net decrease in inventories combined with income tax refunds net of payments of 622 million  offset by financing pulte mortgages lending operations which reduced cash flows from operations by 528 million  in 2011 

investing activities 

investing activities are generally not a significant source or use of cash for us net cash used in investing activities totaled 460 million  in 2013  compared with net cash provided by investing activities of 97 million  in 2012  and net cash used in investing activities of 936 million  in 2011  the use of cash from investing activities in 2013  was primarily due to 289 million  of capital expenditures a 123 million  increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment and a 42 million  increase in the restricted cash we are required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities 

the positive cash flow from investing activities in 2012  was primarily due to a 287 million  decrease in the restricted cash we are required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities which resulted from a reduction in letters of credit outstanding offset by capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated entities 

the use of cash from investing activities for 2011 was due to 832 million  of restricted cash we were required to maintain related to our letter of credit facilities partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment related to the consolidation of certain facilities 

 37 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 6596 million  in 2013  compared with net cash used of 4482 million  and 3240 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively during the last three years we significantly reduced our outstanding senior notes through a variety of transactions including scheduled maturities open market repurchases early redemptions as provided within indenture agreements and tender offers completion of these transactions required the use of 4798 million  6188 million  and 3211 million  of cash in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively during 2013 we also repaid 331 million  of borrowings under the repurchase agreement due to the lower balance of mortgages availableforsale we borrowed 1388 million  under the repurchase agreement in 2012 the year in which it was put in place during 2011 we used internal funds to finance pulte mortgages operations the effects of which are reflected in cash flows from operating activities cash used in financing activities for 2013 also reflects funds used to repurchase common shares and pay dividends partially offset by funds provided by the issuance of common shares in connection with employee stock option exercises 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of our products to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income could be adversely affected 

seasonality 

we experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry historically we have experienced increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  

  

 

we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2013  we had 910 million  of deposits and preacquisition costs relating to option agreements to acquire 28266  homesites with a remaining purchase price of 14 billion  we expect to acquire the majority of these lots within the next two years and the remainder thereafter 

 38 

at december 31 2013  we had 1733 million  of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 331 million  of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2003   2013  

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2013  



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our homebuilding projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2013  we had outstanding letters of credit of 1831 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 10 billion  at december 31 2013  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2013  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 14 billion  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices in certain instances we are required to record the land under option as if we own it at december 31 2013  we recorded assets of 240 million  as land not owned under option agreements 

at december 31 2013  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 124 million  of which our proportionate share was 44 million  of this amount we provided limited recourse guaranties for 08 million  at december 31 2013  see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 39 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1  of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding  – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit on such sale is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed if there is a loss on the sale of the property the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services  – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

 40 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties made by us that the loans met certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if a loan is determined to be faulty we either repurchase the loan from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

in recent years we experienced a significant increase in losses related to repurchase requests as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market in 2006 and 2007 we originated 395 billion  of loans excluding loans originated by centexs former subprime loan business sold by centex in 2006 because we generally do not retain the servicing rights to the loans we originate information regarding the current and historical performance credit quality and outstanding balances of such loans is limited estimating these loan origination liabilities is further complicated by uncertainties surrounding numerous external factors such as various macroeconomic factors including unemployment rates and changes in home prices actions taken by third parties including the parties servicing the loans and the us federal government in its dual capacity as regulator of the us mortgage industry and conservator of the governmentsponsored enterprises commonly known as fannie mae and freddie mac which own or guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the us 

most requests received to date relate to makewhole payments on loans that have been foreclosed requests undergo extensive analysis to confirm the exposure attempt to cure any identified defect and when necessary determine our liability we establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon among other things the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase determining these estimates and the resulting liability requires a significant level of management judgment we are generally able to cure or refute over 60  of the requests received from investors such that we do not believe repurchases or makewhole payments will ultimately be required for those requests that we believe will result in repurchases or makewhole payments actual loss severities are expected to approximate 50  of the outstanding principal balance 

during 2012  and 2011  we recorded provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry our lack of visibility into the current status of the review process of loans by investors the claim volumes we continue to experience changes in values of underlying collateral over time and other uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims actual costs could differ from our current estimates for example if the total number of loans we are required to repurchase is ultimately 10 lower or higher than our current estimates the amount of future losses could decrease or increase by approximately 130 million 

 41 

intangible assets 

we have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the centex merger completed in 2009 and the del webb merger completed in 2001 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives the carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists if the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value to date no impairments relating to tradenames have been recorded however if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of the intangible assets changes the related intangible assets may become impaired 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

selfinsured risks 

we maintain and require our subcontractors to maintain general liability insurance coverage we also maintain builders risk property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance coverage these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims however we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and claims in excess of available insurance policy limits 

our general liability insurance includes coverage for certain construction defects while construction defect claims can relate to a variety of circumstances the majority of our claims relate to alleged problems with siding plumbing foundations and other concrete work windows roofing and heating ventilation and air conditioning systems the availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited and the insurance policies available require companies to maintain higher per occurrence and aggregate retention levels in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by the company policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by the company this selfinsured exposure is limited by reinsurance policies that we purchase general liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex and our coverage varies from policy year to policy year our insurance coverage requires a per occurrence deductible up to an overall aggregate retention level beginning with the first dollar amounts paid on insured claims satisfy our per occurrence and aggregate retention obligations any amounts incurred in excess of the occurrence or aggregate retention levels are covered by insurance up to our purchased coverage levels our insurance policies including the captive insurance subsidiaries reinsurance policies are maintained with highlyrated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate an estimate of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable 

 42 

the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 78  and 74  of the total general liability reserves which represent the vast majority of the total recorded reserves at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses 

adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs because the majority of our recorded reserves relates to ibnr adjustments to reserve amounts for individual existing claims generally do not impact the recorded reserves materially however changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 6681 million  and 7213 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 600 million to 750 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position 

unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for financial statement purposes we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions our evaluations of tax positions consider a variety of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and effective settlements of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense benefit in the period in which the change is made interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense benefit

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financings to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2013  and 2012  our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value 000’s omitted 



derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 75  days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results

homebuilding operations 



in recent years the us housing market experienced a significant decline in the demand for new homes as well as a sharp decline in overall residential real estate values as a result of this industrywide downturn we suffered net losses in each year between 2007  2011 from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments in response to these market conditions we restructured our operations including making significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead costs and managed our business to generate cash including curtailing our investments in inventory we used this positive cash flow to among other things increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt 

in 2012 new home sales in the us increased for the first time since 2005 rising 20 to 367000 homes however this improvement was from a very low base as us home sales in 2011 were the lowest since 1962 although current volume remains very low compared to historical levels the improved environment and our restructuring actions contributed to our return to profitability in 2012 in the long term we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among the national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with more significant land positions broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover in the shortterm we expect that overall market conditions will continue to improve but that improvements will occur unevenly across our markets our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse within the us as of december 31 2012  we had 670  active communities sales prices of unit closings during 2012  ranged from less than 100000  to greater than 900000  with 85  falling within the range of 100000  to 400000  the average unit selling price in 2012  was 276000  compared with 259000  in 2011  259000  in 2010  258000  in 2009  and 284000  in 2008  

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 81  in 2012  compared with 79  in 2011  79  in 2010  77  in 2009  and 75  in 2008  the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses condominiums and other attached housing as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for entrylevel and active adult homebuyers 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 19 billion   6458  units at december 31 2012  and 11 billion   3924  units at december 31 2011  for each order in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2012  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2013  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of homes for sale to homebuyers though we periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development additionally we may determine that certain land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to targeted consumer groups we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of land option contracts which enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by land sellers until we have determined whether and when to exercise our option our use of land option agreements reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period while our overall supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets some of our controlled land consists of longterm positions that will not be converted to home sales in the near term accordingly we remain active in our pursuit of new land investment 

land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in the normal course of business we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2012  we controlled 119875  lots of which 103060  were owned and 16815  were under option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we stratify our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups such stratification provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group through our portfolio of brands each serving unique consumer groups we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers 



the moveup buyers in our pulte homes communities tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points our centex brand is targeted to entrylevel buyers and these homes tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults our del webb brand offers both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these highly amenitized communities offer a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the age fiftyfive and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be very large consisting in some cases of several thousand homes and have longer life cycles in some cases extending beyond 10 years 

we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements mobile applications and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays mobile customers in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom  and wwwcentexcom  provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us there were approximately 80 million  unique visits to our websites during 2012  compared to approximately 67 million  in 2011 

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in consumerinspired home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants create distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared to existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency hvac systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

typically our sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process fully furnished and landscaped model homes are generally used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the house construction process 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices including lean production principles beginning in 2011 we implemented an intensive effort to improve our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 

the availability of labor and materials at reasonable prices is becoming an increasing concern for certain trades and building materials in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule however we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials and labor will be available at reasonable prices in the future 

competition 

the housing industry in the united states is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only 5 of new home sales in 2012  in each of our local markets there are numerous national regional and local homebuilders with whom we compete additionally new home sales traditionally represent less than 15 of overall us home sales new and existing homes therefore we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of housing units for sale or to rent including apartment operators may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues profitability and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings while the challenging market conditions experienced in recent years lessened the seasonal variations of our results we have experienced a return to a more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year if and when the homebuilding industry more fully recovers from the recent downturn we believe these traditional seasonal patterns will continue 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees and suppliers  subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the operating results of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding during 2012  2011  and 2010  we originated mortgage loans for 67  61  and 62  respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 819  in 2012  785  in 2011  and 775  in 2010  

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to outside investors substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center staffed with loan consultants to perform our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate as well as to those of other government agencies that have oversight of the governmentsponsored investors or consumer lending rules in the us in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a makewhole payment historically our overall losses related to this risk were not significant beginning in 2009 however we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell historically we have not experienced significant claims related to our title operations 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the united states however we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2012  we employed 3634  people of which 697  people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn in recent years although industry conditions improved during 2012 the overall us economy remains weak and the timing of a broad sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry remains uncertain a deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in recent years the us housing market was unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy these conditions contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales as a result of these factors we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability we have also incurred substantial impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets during 2012 overall industry new home sales increased and we returned to profitability however the overall demand for new homes remains at low historical levels and the timing of a broad sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry remains uncertain accordingly we can provide no assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

as a result of the challenging market conditions in the homebuilding industry we have incurred significant landrelated charges resulting from the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs related to land transactions we elected not to pursue net realizable valuation adjustments related to land positions sold or held for sale impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and impairments of our recorded goodwill it is reasonably possible that the estimated cash flows from our projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation adjustments additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets for additional impairments or writedowns which could result in additional charges that might be significant 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in the past we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

to date the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market in 2006 and 2007 we originated 395 billion of loans excluding loans originated by centexs former subprime loan business sold by centex in 2006 

in addition we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centex’s mortgage operations which ceased loan origination activities in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by centex this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could exceed existing estimates and accruals the repurchase liability we recorded is estimated based on several factors including the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments the economic environment and other circumstances some of which are beyond our control accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through our mortgage bank interest rates have been near historical lows for several years which has made new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

in addition the federal reserve has purchased a sizeable amount of mortgagebacked securities in part to stabilize mortgage interest rates and to support the market for mortgagebacked securities as the federal reserve reduces its holdings of mortgagebacked securities over time the availability and affordability of mortgage loans including the consumer interest rates for such loans could be adversely affected 

we also believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes the fha has and may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards raise minimum down payment requirements impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs andor limit the number of mortgages it insures the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years in many cases the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers we need liquidity for future growth and development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2012  we had cash and equivalents of 14 billion  as well as restricted cash totaling 720 million  however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2012  we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 1792 million  and 10 billion  respectively of these amounts outstanding 545 million  of the letters of credit were subject to cashcollateralized agreements while the remaining letters of credit and surety bonds were unsecured if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation of our tax matters is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment for such items is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our financial position or net income for such period 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income and executing tax planning strategies we have recorded valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowance will fluctuate as conditions change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we have not experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

as a result of the merger with centex in august 2009 our ability to use certain of centex’s preownership change nols bils and deductions is limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code the applicable section 382 limitation is approximately 674 million per year for nols losses realized on builtin loss assets that are sold within 60 months of the ownership change ie before august 2014 and certain deductions we do not believe that the section 382 limitation will prevent the company from using centexs preownership change nol carryforwards and builtin losses or deductions 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates expected to be in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to prior business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our operating earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective cost of our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies 

on january 10 2013 the consumer financial protection bureau adopted new rules regarding the origination of mortgages including the criteria for “qualified mortgages” the new rules are scheduled to go into effect in january 2014 we are in the process of analyzing the new rules and the impact such rules will have on our business additionally many other rules required by the doddfrank act of 2010 have not yet been completed or implemented which has created uncertainty in the overall us financial services and mortgage industries as to their longterm impact 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative impact on housing demand 

information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems including our backup systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our associates if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged breached or cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our homebuyers and business partners which could require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the us could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the us or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

in 2012 new home sales in the us increased for the first time since 2005 although this volume remains very low compared to historical levels the improved environment and our restructuring actions contributed to our return to profitability in 2012 as net new orders closings revenues gross margin and overhead leverage all improved compared with 2011 during the year our net new orders increased 25  over 2011 from 4  fewer active communities we also generated significant positive operating cash flow highlighting some of the benefits of our efforts to improve our capital efficiency by using our existing land assets more efficiently allocating capital more effectively and controlling unsold spec inventory we continued to enhance our balance sheet and position the company to deliver higher longterm returns 

 while the timing of a broad sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry remains uncertain we believe that new home demand is moving along a path toward recovery the value in new housing resulting from affordable prices low mortgage rates escalating rents and more energyefficient homes is providing consumers with a compelling reason to buy a new home especially relative to the ever more expensive rental market and the tightened supply of available existing homes in the short term we believe that 2013 will be a better year for us housing than 2012 in spite of continued high levels of unemployment and related low levels of consumer confidence a challenging us macroeconomic environment and potential regulatory reforms that may impact the housing and mortgage industries in the long term we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale at a local level access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among the national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with more significant land positions broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover we continue to focus on our primary operational objectives 

 

continued focus on these operational objectives combined with improvements in industry conditions have resulted in a return to profitability in our homebuilding operations and an increase in profits in our financial services businesses 

the following is a summary of our operating results by line of business 000s omitted except per share data 



 

for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our homebuilding operating results improved significantly from the losses experienced in 2011 and 2010 as the result of the lower charges listed in the above table as well as higher revenues increased gross margins and improved overhead leverage

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income loss before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 



 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2012 were higher than 2011 by 6017 million  or 15  the increase was attributable to a 7  increase in the average selling price combined with an 8  increase in closings the increase in average selling price reflects an ongoing shift in our revenue mix toward moveup buyers and improved market conditions the increase in closings was realized from 4  fewer active communities and was concentrated primarily in our north and southwest segments 

home sale revenues for 2011 were lower than 2010 by 4691 million  or 11  the decrease was attributable to an 11  decrease in closings as average selling prices remained stable from 2010 to 2011 the decline in closings for 2011 compared with 2010 occurred in each of our homebuilding segments except for florida and resulted primarily from lower industry volumes in part due to the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit that existed during 2010 this tax credit favorably impacted new orders and closings during the first half of 2010 in part we believe by pulling forward customer demand the 11  decrease in our active communities also contributed to the lower closings 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 158  in 2012  compared with 128  in 2011  and 94  in 2010  gross margins during 2012  and 2011  benefited from lower land and community valuation adjustments of 134 million  and 159 million  respectively compared to 1697 million  in 2010  the increase in gross margins was despite increased capitalized interest amortization which reduced gross margins by 10 basis points and 70 basis points in 2012 and 2011 respectively as compared with the comparable prior year periods the higher capitalized interest amortization was attributable primarily to debt assumed with our 2009 merger with centex 

excluding the impact of land and community valuation adjustments and capitalized interest amortization adjusted home sale gross margins improved to 209  in 2012  from 179  in 2011  and 167  in 2010  see the nongaap financial measures section for a reconciliation of adjusted home sale gross margins these improved gross margins reflect a combination of factors including shifts in the product mix of homes closed toward moveup buyers better alignment of our product offering with current market conditions contributions from our strategic pricing and house cost reduction objectives and in 2012 an improved demand and pricing environment 

land sales 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales had margin contributions of 118 million  236 million  and 257 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively these margin contributions included net realizable value adjustments related to land held for sale totaling 15 million  98 million  and 391 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

sga 

in order to reduce overhead costs we have reconfigured our organization in recent years to better align our overhead structure with expected volumes these actions have included consolidating many local divisions along with reducing corporate and support staffing across a number of functions as a result sga as a percentage of home sale revenues dropped from 132  in 2011  to 113  in 2012  the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased 51 million  or 1  in 2012  compared to 2011  due to this improved overhead leverage partially offset primarily by higher incentive compensation resulting from our improved operating results 

the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased 3755 million  or 42  in 2011  compared to 2010  while sga as a percentage of home sale revenues dropped to 132  in 2011  from 203  in 2010  sga in 2010 included 2804 million  in insurance reserve adjustments substantially all of which related to general liability construction defect claims see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of insurance reserve adjustments excluding these insurance reserve adjustments sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 132  and 139  in 2011  and 2010  respectively see the nongaap financial measures section for a reconciliation of sga as a percentage of home sale revenue excluding insurance reserve adjustments this improved overhead leverage resulted from a combination of better matching our overall cost structure with the current business environment and lower severance and equity compensation expense in 2011 compared to 2010 

equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities 

equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities was 39 million  32 million  and 28 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures as a result the timing of income and losses varies between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity 

  

other expense income net 

other expense income net includes the following 000’s omitted 



for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements miscellaneous expense income net includes 51 million  in 2012 and 171 million  in 2011 related to the writedown of notes receivable 

interest income net 

the increase in interest income net for 2012 compared with 2011 resulted primarily from higher invested cash balances the decrease in interest income net in 2011 compared with 2010 resulted from lower invested cash balances 

net new orders 

net new orders increased 25  in 2012  compared with 2011  while selling from 4  fewer active communities in 2012  670  at december 31 2012  the increase in net new orders was broadbased as each of our reportable segments experienced increases during 2012 with the largest increases occurring in our north and southwest segments the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period was 15  in 2012 compared to 19  in 2011 ending backlog units which represent orders for homes that have not yet closed increased 65  at december 31 2012  compared with december 31 2011  due to the increase in net new orders 

net new order levels were essentially flat for 2011 compared with 2010 net new orders reflected the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit that expired during 2010 which favorably impacted new orders during the first half of 2010 and the reduced number of active communities in 2011 at december 31 2011 we had 700  active communities a decrease of 11  from december 31 2010 the cancellation rate for 2011 was unchanged from 2010 at 19  ending backlog was essentially flat at december 31 2011 compared with december 31 2010 consistent with the overall new order levels 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2012  and 2011  



the slight decrease in homes in production at december 31 2012  compared to december 31 2011  is the result of a significant reduction in homes unsold to customers spec homes largely offset by a large increase in the number of sold homes in production reducing our reliance on sales of spec homes is a component of our strategic pricing and inventory turns objectives so we focused in 2012 on lowering the overall level of spec home inventory especially completed specs final specs the increase in sold homes in production resulted from the significant increase in net new orders and backlog 

controlled lots 

the following is a summary of our lots under control at december 31 2012  and 2011  



of our controlled lots 103060  and 116933  were owned and 9634  and 10060  were under option agreements approved for purchase at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively in addition there were 7181  and 4017  lots under option agreements pending approval at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively while we continue to purchase land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so the reduction in lots resulting from closings land disposition activity and withdrawals from land option contracts exceeded the number of lots added by new transactions during the year ended december 31 2012  this trend is consistent with our focus on improving our inventory turns 

the remaining purchase price under our land option agreements totaled 9234 million  at december 31 2012  these land option agreements which generally may be canceled at our discretion and in certain cases extend over several years are secured by deposits and preacquisition costs totaling 701 million  of which only 29 million  is refundable 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information about our home sale gross margins and selling general and administrative expenses “sga” reflecting certain adjustments these measures are considered nongaap financial measures under the secs rules and should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the comparable gaap financial measures as measures of our operating performance management and our local divisions use these measures in evaluating the operating performance of each community and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing construction and development pace product mix and other daily operating decisions we believe they are relevant and useful measures to investors for evaluating our performance through 1 gross profit generated on homes delivered during a given period and 2 the efficiency of our overhead cost structure and for comparing our operating performance to other companies in the homebuilding industry although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information the methods used may differ we urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate gross margins and sga and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to that of such other companies 

the following tables set forth reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the gaap financial measures that management believes to be most directly comparable 000s omitted

northeast 

for 2012  northeast home sale revenues increased 1  compared with 2011  due to a 6  increase in the average selling price offset in part by a 4  decrease in closings the increase in average selling price occurred primarily in the northeast corridor and midatlantic while the decrease in closings was concentrated in the northeast corridor and was due to a significant decrease in active communities the significant increase in income before income taxes was due to moderately improved gross margins and 219 million  of expense in 2011 related to the writedown of a note receivable and unfavorable resolution of certain contingencies net new orders increased 14  led by our operations in new england 

for 2011  northeast home sale revenues decreased 5  compared with 2010  due to a 10  decrease in closings offset in part by a 5  increase in the average selling price the reduction in closing volumes was primarily due to fewer closings in our midatlantic division in part due to a lower active community count the decreased income before income taxes was primarily due to expense of 219 million  in 2011 related to the writedown of a note receivable and unfavorable resolution of certain contingencies such expense was partially offset by improved gross margin compared to the prior year net new orders increased 6  in 2011 led by our operations in the northeast corridor and midatlantic 

southeast 

for 2012  southeast home sale revenues increased 2  compared with 2011  due to a 2  increase in the average selling price partially offset by a 1  decrease in closings the increase in average selling price was concentrated in georgia and tennessee the decrease in closing volumes was  primarily due to a moderate decrease in raleigh the increased income before income taxes was due to moderately improved gross margins net new orders increased 16  in 2012  and reflected increases across all divisions 

for 2011  southeast home sale revenues decreased 10  compared with 2010  due to a 10  decrease in closings as there was no  change in the average selling price the reduction in closing volumes was primarily due to fewer closings in our georgia division as well as a lower active community count across all divisions gross margin improved compared with the prior year period the increased income before income taxes was also due to lower landrelated charges net new orders decreased 4  compared with 2010  due in part to decreased activity in our tennessee division 

florida 

for 2012  florida home sale revenues increased 11  compared with 2011  due to a 7  increase in the average selling price and a 4  increase in closings the increase in income before income taxes for 2012  was attributable to significantly improved gross margins and overhead leverage as well as lower landrelated charges net new orders increased by 19  in 2012  evenly across north and south florida 

for 2011  florida home sale revenues increased 3  compared with 2010  due to a 1  increase in closings combined with a 2  increase in the average selling price the majority of this improvement was due to increased closing volumes in north florida the income before income taxes in 2011  was attributable to improved gross margins and significantly lower landrelated charges than in 2010  net new order units increased by 13  in 2011  in part due to grand openings or grand reopenings at several large communities 

texas 

for 2012  texas home sale revenues increased 8  compared with the prior year period due to a 5  increase in closings combined with a 3  increase in average selling price the increase in closings was experienced across all markets but was concentrated in houston and san antonio the increase in average selling price was concentrated in central texas and dallas the significant increase in income before income taxes for 2012  was attributable to moderately improved gross margins and overhead leverage net new orders increased by 26  for 2012  and reflected increases across all divisions 

for 2011  texas home sale revenues decreased 4  compared with 2010 due to a 7  decrease in closings partially offset by a 3  increase in the average selling price the reduction in closing volumes was mainly due to central texas and san antonio the increased income before income taxes in 2011  was attributable to improved gross margins and lower landrelated charges than in the prior year period net new order units increased by 5  for 2011  in part due to the grand opening of a large community in houston 

north 

for 2012  north home sale revenues increased 36  compared with the prior year period due to a 20  increase in closings and a 13  increase in average selling price the increase in closing volumes was broadbased across all divisions with the largest increases coming from our michigan and indianapolis operations the increase in average selling price was due to increases at all divisions except michigan with the most significant increases in minnesota and the pacific northwest the substantial increase in income before income taxes as compared to the loss experienced in 2011 was due to the increased revenues significantly improved gross margins and overhead leverage a significant reduction in landrelated charges and gains related to land sale transactions net new orders increased by 39  in 2012  compared with 2011  and reflected moderate to significant increases across all divisions with the largest increases in michigan and northern california 

for 2011  north home sale revenues decreased 16  compared with 2010 due to a 16  decrease in closings as there was no  change in average selling price the decrease in closing volumes was due to significantly fewer closings in our minnesota st louis and northern california divisions gross margin decreased slightly the loss before income taxes was primarily due to the reduced revenues offset in part by reduced landrelated charges net new order units decreased by 3  in 2011  compared with 2010  primarily in our minnesota st louis and northern california divisions the sales volumes for our northern california division reflect the impact of the state homebuyer tax credit that existed in california during 2010 the expiration of this tax credit exacerbated the already challenging local market conditions these declines were partially offset by improvements in our other north divisions 

southwest 

for 2012  southwest home sale revenues increased 31  compared with the prior year period due to a 22  increase in closings and a 7  increase in average selling price the increase in average selling price occurred across all divisions the significant increase in income before income taxes was due to the higher revenues moderately improved gross margins and better overhead leverage in 2011 the southwest also benefited from land sale gains totaling 155 million  net new orders increased by 33  in 2012  compared with 2011  with significant increases across all divisions except colorado 

for 2011  southwest home sale revenues decreased 24  compared with 2010  due to a 20  decrease in closings and a 6  decrease in average selling price the decreases were due to weakness in each of our divisions combined with the closeout in late 2010 of our luxury condo community in hawaii that had average selling prices in excess of 1 million the increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to improved gross margins and the significant decrease in landrelated charges the southwest also benefited from land sale gains totaling 155 million  in 2011 net new order units decreased by 9  in 2011  compared with 2010  due to the closeout of our community in hawaii as well as reduced activity in our las vegas and southern california markets sales volumes for southern california reflect the impact of the state homebuyer tax credit that existed in california during 2010 the expiration of which exacerbated the already challenging local market conditions 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds including funds available pursuant to credit agreements with either third parties or with the company substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination generally within 30 days we sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the operating results of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production representing 99  of loan originations for both 2012  and 2011  and 98  for 2010  we believe that our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings is an important metric in evaluating the effectiveness of our captive mortgage business model 

the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  



revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2012  increased 56  compared to 2011  due to a 19  increase in loan origination volumes an increase in average loan size and improved loan pricing the increase in loan origination volumes was due to a higher capture rate higher homebuilding closing volumes and fewer cash sales interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was moderately higher in 2012  than in 2011  due to the increase in loan originations 

financial services revenues during 2011  decreased 15  compared with 2010  due in large part to a 12  decrease in loan origination volumes compared to 2010 resulting from lower homebuilding volumes interest income was moderately lower in 2011 than in 2010 due to lower interest rates on loans originated 

in recent years the mortgage industry has experienced a significant overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production and fixed rate loans versus adjustable rate mortgages “arms” and unconventional loans the substantial majority of loan production during 2012  2011  and 2010  consisted of fixed rate loans the majority of which are prime conforming loans the shift toward agency fixedrate loans has contributed to profitability as such loans generally result in higher profitability due to higher servicing values and structured guidelines that allow for expense efficiencies when processing the loan additionally the historically low interest rates and difficult regulatory environment in recent periods has contributed to profitability by reducing the level of pricing competition in the market 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

in recent years we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market during 2012  2011  and 2010  we recorded additional provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates losses related to loan origination liabilities totaled 490 million  593 million  and 169 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively and are reflected in financial services expenses given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates see our critical accounting policies and estimates  and note 13  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centexs mortgage operations which ceased loan origination activities in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by centex this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centexs mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans other than with respect to this pool of loans our contractual repurchase obligations are limited to our mortgage subsidiaries which are included in nonguarantor subsidiaries see note 14  for a discussion of nonguarantor subsidiaries 

the mortgage subsidiary of centex also sold loans to a bank for inclusion in residential mortgagebacked securities “rmbss” issued by the bank in connection with these sales centexs mortgage subsidiary entered into agreements pursuant to which it may be required to indemnify the bank for losses incurred by investors in the rmbss arising out of material errors or omissions in certain information provided by the mortgage subsidiary relating to the loans and loan origination process in 2011 the bank notified us that it has been named defendant in two lawsuits alleging various violations of federal and state securities laws asserting that untrue statements of material fact were included in the registration statements used to market the sale of two rmbs transactions which included 162 million  of loans originated by centexs mortgage subsidiary neither centexs mortgage subsidiary nor the company is named as a defendant in these actions these actions are in their preliminary stage and we cannot yet quantify centexs mortgage subsidiarys potential liability as a result of these indemnification obligations we do not believe however that these matters will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company we are aware of six other rmbs transactions with such indemnity provisions that include an aggregate 116 million  of loans and we are not aware of any current or threatened legal proceedings regarding those transactions 

income before income taxes 

the income before income taxes for 2012  as compared to the loss before income taxes in the prior year period was due to higher origination volumes improved loan pricing and lower loss reserves related to loans originated in previous years such loss reserves totaled 490 million  in 2012  compared with 593 million  in 2011  see loan origination liabilities  above 

the loss before income taxes in 2011  was due to increased loss reserves related to contingent loan origination liabilities which totaled 593 million  in 2011  compared to 169 million  in 2010  see loan origination liabilities  above excluding these losses our financial services segment experienced higher profitability during 2011  than in 2010  primarily as the result of improved loan pricing 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors the most significant of which are the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits due to the effects of these factors our effective tax rates for 2010  through 2012  are not correlated to the amount of our income or loss before income taxes our effective tax rates were 123  322  and 112  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively the income tax benefits for 2012  2011  and 2010  were primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations by using internallygenerated funds supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if market conditions deteriorate if significant growth returns to the homebuilding industry or if favorable capital market opportunities become available 

at december 31 2012  we had unrestricted cash and equivalents of 14 billion  and senior notes of 25 billion  we also had restricted cash balances of 720 million  the substantial majority of which related to cash serving as collateral under certain letter of credit facilities other financing sources include various letter of credit facilities and surety bond arrangements 

we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm investments generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities we monitor our investments with each bank and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding our financial services debt was 534  at december 31 2012  and 321  net of cash and equivalents including restricted cash the ratio of debt to total capitalization remains above our desired target therefore we are actively pursuing strategies to reduce our leverage through a combination of cashgenerating activities reducing debt and returning to consistent profitability in 2012 this was evidenced by the significant cash flow generated from our operations primarily through a reduction of inventory retiring 5924 million  of outstanding debt and returning our operations to profitability 

credit agreements 

we maintain separate cashcollateralized letter of credit agreements with a number of financial institutions letters of credit totaling 545 million  were outstanding under these agreements at december 31 2012  under these agreements we are required to maintain deposits with these financial institutions in amounts approximating the letters of credit outstanding such deposits are included in restricted cash 

we also maintain an unsecured letter of credit facility that expires in september 2014  this facility originally permitted the issuance of up to 2000 million  of letters of credit for general corporate purposes in support of any whollyowned subsidiary we voluntarily reduced the capacity of this facility to 1500 million  effective july 2 2012  at december 31 2012  1246 million  of letters of credit were outstanding under this facility 

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by utilizing its own funds and funds made available pursuant to credit agreements with third parties or through intercompany borrowings pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors which generally occurs within 30 days in september 2012  pulte mortgage entered into a master repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” with third party lenders the repurchase agreement provides for loan purchases of up to 1500 million  subject to certain sublimits and borrowings under the repurchase agreement are secured by residential mortgage loans availableforsale at december 31 2012  pulte mortgage had 1388 million  outstanding under the repurchase agreement which expires in september 2013  while there can be no assurances that the repurchase agreement can be renewed or replaced on commercially reasonable terms upon its expiration we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet pulte mortgages anticipated financing needs 

stock repurchase programs 

pursuant to 100 million  stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october 2002  and october 2005  and a 200 million  stock repurchase authorization in february 2006  for a total stock repurchase authorization of 400 million  we have repurchased a total of 9688900  shares for a total of 2977 million  there have been no repurchases under these programs since 2006 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 1023 million  at december 31 2012  

dividends 

we did not declare a dividend in 2012 2011 or 2010 future dividends will depend upon a variety of factors considered relevant by the board of directors including our earnings capital requirements financial condition market conditions and other factors 

cash flows 

in 2012 we generated significant positive operating cash flow through a combination of earnings and significant reductions in inventory however as growth conditions return to the homebuilding industry we will need to invest significant capital into our operations to support such growth additionally the supply of finished lots fully developed land ready for immediate home construction has declined in many of our markets as a result we expect that raw or partially developed land and related development costs will represent an increasing proportion of our future land investments which may result in increased inventory levels 

operating activities 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2012  was 7601 million  compared with 173 million  and 5921 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively generally the primary drivers of our cash flow from operations are profitability and changes in inventory levels our positive cash flow from operations for 2012 was primarily due to our net income of 2061 million  combined with a net decrease in inventories of 4552 million  the inventory decrease resulted from lower reinvestment in land inventory combined with a significant reduction in spec homes in production partially offset by an increase in sold homes in production 

the net losses for 2011 and 2010 were largely the result of noncash asset impairments and insurance reserve adjustments so the cash flows from operations each period primarily relate to changes in working capital our positive cash flow from operations in 2011 was primarily the result of a net decrease in inventories combined with income tax refunds net of payments of 622 million  offset by financing pulte mortgages lending operations which reduced cash flows from operations by 528 million  in 2011 

our positive cash flow from operations for 2010 was primarily the result of income tax refunds net of payments of 9413 million  after adjusting for these tax refunds operating cash flow was negative for 2010 cash flows from operations in 2010 were negatively impacted by the voluntary repurchase of certain community development district obligations for 1112 million  see above and using 745 million  to finance pulte mortgages lending operations during 2010 inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale decreased slightly 

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities totaled 97 million  in 2012  compared with net cash used in investing activities of 936 million  in 2011  and 195 million  in 2010  the positive cash flow from investing activities in 2012  was primarily due to a 287 million  decrease in the restricted cash we are required to maintain under our letter of credit facilities which resulted from a reduction in letters of credit outstanding offset by capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated entities 

the negative cash flow from investing activities for 2011 was due to 832 million  of restricted cash we were required to maintain related to our letter of credit facilities partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment related to the consolidation of certain facilities 

the net cash used in investing activities in 2010 was primarily the result of investments in unconsolidated entities and capital expenditures partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated entities and a reduction in residential mortgage loans held for investment 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 4482 million  in 2012  compared with 3240 million  and 9497 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively during the last three years we significantly reduced our outstanding senior notes through a variety of transactions including scheduled maturities open market repurchases early redemptions as provided within indenture agreements and tender offers completion of these transactions required the use of 6188 million  3211 million  and 9359 million  of cash in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively cash used in financing activities in 2012 also reflects 1388 million  of borrowings under the repurchase agreement as well as 328 million  from issuance of common shares in connection with stock option exercises as discussed above we used internal funds to finance pulte mortgages operations during 2011 and 2010 the effects of which are reflected in cash flows from operating activities 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices market forces may limit our ability to do so if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 

seasonality 

our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues profitability and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings while the challenging market conditions experienced in recent years lessened the seasonal variations of our results we have experienced a return to a more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year if and when the homebuilding industry more fully recovers from the recent downturn we believe these traditional seasonal patterns will continue 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2012  

  

 we are subject to certain obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2012  we had 701 million  of deposits and preacquisition costs relating to option agreements to acquire 16815  homesites with a remaining purchase price of 9234 million  we expect to acquire approximately half of these lots within the next two years and the remainder thereafter 

at december 31 2012  we had 1704 million  of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 315 million  of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2003   2012  

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2012  



 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2012  we had outstanding letters of credit of 1792 million  our surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 10 billion  at december 31 2012  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2012  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 9234 million  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices in certain instances we are required to record the land under option as if we own it at december 31 2012  we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of 311 million  as land not owned under option agreements 

at december 31 2012  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 69 million  of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was 16 million  of our proportionate share of joint venture debt we provided limited recourse guaranties for 08 million  at december 31 2012  see note 6  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1  of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding  – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services  – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory valuation 

inventory is stated at cost unless the carrying value is determined to not be recoverable in which case the affected inventory is written down to fair value cost includes land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

we record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

we sell substantially all of the loans we originate to investors in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination in recent years we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market in 2006 and 2007 we originated 395 billion  of loans excluding loans originated by centexs former subprime loan business sold by centex in 2006 because we generally do not retain the servicing rights to the loans we originate information regarding the current and historical performance credit quality and outstanding balances of such loans is limited estimating these loan origination liabilities is further complicated by uncertainties surrounding numerous external factors such as various macroeconomic factors including unemployment rates and changes in home prices actions taken by third parties including the parties servicing the loans and the us federal government in its dual capacity as regulator of the us mortgage industry and conservator of the governmentsponsored enterprises commonly known as fannie mae and freddie mac which own or guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the us 

most requests received to date relate to makewhole payments on loans that have been foreclosed generally after a portion of the loan principal had been paid down which reduces our exposure requests undergo extensive analysis to confirm the exposure attempt to cure the identified defect and when necessary determine our liability we establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon among other things the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase determining these estimates and the resulting liability requires a significant level of management judgment we are generally able to cure or refute over 60  of the requests received from investors such that we do not believe repurchases or makewhole payments will ultimately be required for those requests that we believe will result in repurchases or makewhole payments actual loss severities are expected to approximate 50  of the outstanding principal balance 

during 2012  2011  and 2010  we recorded additional provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates our current estimates assume that such requests will continue through 2014 given the ongoing volatility in the mortgage industry our lack of visibility into the current status of the review process of loans by investors the claim volumes we continue to experience and uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates for example if the total number of loans we are required to repurchase is ultimately 10 lower or higher than our current estimates the amount of future losses would decrease or increase by approximately 160 million 

intangible assets 

we have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the centex merger completed in 2009 and the del webb merger completed in 2001 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives the carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists if the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value while the industry downturn in recent years has resulted in a decline in the fair value of these intangible assets this decline has not yet resulted in an impairment of the assets carrying values however if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of the intangible assets changes the related intangible assets may be impaired 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

selfinsured risks 

we maintain and require our subcontractors to maintain general liability insurance coverage we also maintain builders risk property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance coverage these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims however we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and claims in excess of available insurance policy limits 

our general liability insurance includes coverage for certain construction defects while construction defect claims can relate to a variety of circumstances the majority of our claims relate to alleged problems with siding plumbing foundations and other concrete work windows roofing and heating ventilation and air conditioning systems the availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited and the insurance policies available require companies to maintain higher per occurrence and aggregate retention levels in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by the company policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by the company this selfinsured exposure is limited by reinsurance policies that we purchase general liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex and our coverage varies from policy year to policy year our insurance coverage requires a per occurrence deductible up to an overall aggregate retention level beginning with the first dollar amounts paid on insured claims satisfy our per occurrence and aggregate retention obligations any amounts incurred in excess of the occurrence or aggregate retention levels are covered by insurance up to our purchased coverage levels our insurance policies including the captive insurance subsidiaries reinsurance policies are maintained with highlyrated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses relating to legal fees expert fees and claims handling expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate an estimate of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims these estimates make up a significant portion of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of our costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable 

the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 74  and 78  of the total general liability reserves which represent the vast majority of the total recorded reserves at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses 

adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs because the majority of our recorded reserves relates to ibnr adjustments to reserve amounts for individual existing claims generally do not impact the recorded reserves materially however changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves 

we have experienced a high level of insurancerelated expenses in recent years primarily due to the adverse development of general liability claims the frequency and severity of which have increased significantly over historical levels during 2010 we experienced a greater than anticipated frequency of newly reported claims and a significant increase in specific case reserves related to certain known claims the general nature of these claims was not out of the ordinary but the frequency and severity of the claims were in excess of our historical experience as a result of these unfavorable trends we recorded additional reserves totaling 2804 million   074  per basic and diluted share within selling general and administrative expenses substantially all of this additional reserve related to general liability exposures a large portion of which resulted from revising our actuarial assumptions surrounding the longterm frequency severity and development of claims during the industry downturn over the last several years and especially in 2010 we experienced adverse claim frequency and severity compared with longer term averages in 2010 we deemed it appropriate to assume that the longterm future frequency severity and development of claims will most closely resemble the claims activity experienced in recent years 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled 7213 million  and 7390 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 650 million to 800 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

income taxes 

we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements asc 740 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and settlements of audit issues 

we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required 

we continue to analyze all available positive and negative evidence in determining the continuing need for a valuation allowance this evaluation considers among other factors historical operating results forecasts of future profitability and the duration of statutory carryforward periods one of the primary pieces of negative evidence we consider is the significant losses we have incurred in recent years including being in a significant threeyear cumulative pretax loss position at december 31 2012  other negative evidence includes a challenging us macroeconomic environment and uncertainty regarding the timing of a broad sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry however we earned a profit before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2012  and have seen significant increases in new orders backlog and home sale gross margin if current business trends continue including continued improvements in the homebuilding industry and we continue to be profitable we believe that there could be sufficient positive evidence to support reducing a large portion of the valuation allowance during 

2013 realization of a portion of our deferred tax assets for state nol carryforwards and other items however is more unlikely than the realization of federal deferred tax assets this is due to the need to generate sufficient taxable income in each of the respective jurisdictions prior to the expirations of the various state carryforward periods some of which expire sooner than the 20year federal nol carryforwards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financings to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2012  and 2011  our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value 000’s omitted 



derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor we are generally not exposed to variability in cash flows of derivative instruments for more than approximately 60  days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment we enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results

homebuilding operations 



since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment increased unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy these conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales new home sales in the us declined to 302000  new home sales in 2011  which represents the lowest level since at least 1962 and a decline of approximately 77 from the 2005 peak of 13 million new home sales we have experienced significant net losses in each year between 2007  2011 resulting from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments 

in response to these market conditions we have made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead costs including a series of consolidations of our local operating divisions and corporate functions we also significantly curtailed our investments in inventory implemented a more rigorous riskbased approach to land investment and liquidated certain of our less strategic land positions we are seeking to better align the size and features of our homes with the current demand environment and achieve significant reductions in house cost by valueengineering our floor plans to improve the efficiency of construction rebidding supplier contracts and working with suppliers to find cost savings and focusing on lean production principles in recent years we generated significant positive cash flow primarily through refunds of income taxes paid in prior years combined with limiting the level of reinvestment into inventory we have used this positive cash flow to among other things increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt through the combination of these operational and capital structure activities we have positioned the company for future profitability even at the current low industry volumes 

in the longterm we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among the national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with more significant land positions broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover in the shortterm we expect that market conditions will remain challenging our strategy to enhance shareholder value is centered around the following operational objectives 

 as of december 31 2011  our homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in approximately 700 communities sales prices of unit closings during 2011  ranged from less than 100000  to greater than 900000  with 88  falling within the range of 100000  to 400000  the average unit selling price in 2011  was 259000  compared with 259000  in 2010  258000  in 2009  284000  in 2008  and 322000  in 2007  the significant decrease in the average selling price of our homes since 2007  resulted from a combination of pricing pressures due to challenging industry conditions changes in the geographic mix of homes closed adjusting our product offerings to better align with current market conditions and an increase in the mix of entrylevel buyers as the result of the centex merger 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 79  in 2011  compared with 79  in 2010  77  in 2009  75  in 2008  and 74  in 2007  the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses condominiums and other attached housing as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for entrylevel and active adult homebuyers 

our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result help to insulate us from demand changes in individual markets since 2006 however such diversification has not insulated us from demand changes due to the nationwide downturn in the homebuilding industry that has had a significant adverse impact on our operations in each of our markets 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 11 billion   3924  units at december 31 2011  and 11 billion   3984  units at december 31 2010  for each order in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and the required customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2011  substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2012  though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers though we periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development additionally we may determine that certain land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of the necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location with our product offering to targeted consumer groups we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of option contracts we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large masterplanned projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period as a result of the downturn in the homebuilding industry that began in 2006 however our supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets 

land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in the normal course of business we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and community amenities such as parks pools and clubhouses we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2011  we controlled 131010  lots of which 116933  were owned and 14077  were under option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group through our portfolio of brands each serving unique customer segments we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers 



our centex brand is targeted to entrylevel buyers and these communities tend to be smaller with product offerings geared toward lower average selling prices the moveup buyers in our pulte homes communities tend to place more of a premium on location and amenities these communities typically offer larger homes at higher price points through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults our del webb brand offers both destination communities 

and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these highly amenitized communities offer a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the age fiftyfive and over buyer to maintain an active lifestyle in order to make the cost of these highly amenitized communities affordable to the individual homeowner del webb communities tend to be very large consisting in some cases of several thousand homes and have longer life cycles in some cases extending beyond 10 years 

we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements mobile applications and other advertising displays we have made significant enhancements in our tools and business practices to adapt our selling efforts to todays mobile customers in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom  and wwwcentexcom  provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us approximately 67 million  people visited our websites during 2011  

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in home design and we view our design capabilities as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants create distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research energy efficiency represents an important source of value for new homes compared to existing homes and represents a key area of focus for our home designs including high efficiency hvac systems and insulation lowemissivity windows solar power in certain geographies and other energyefficient features 

typically our sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features 

construction 

the construction of our homes is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the house construction process 

continuous improvement in our house construction process is a key area of focus we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices including lean production principles we also use component offsite manufacturing methods for certain portions of the construction process to provide high efficiency high quality and lower cost products to our customers during 2011 we began a more intensive effort to improve our product offerings and production processes through the following programs 

 we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future while the availability of materials and labor is not a significant concern under current market conditions we have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets in previous years additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives 

competition 

the housing industry in the united states is fragmented and highly competitive while we are one of the largest homebuilders in the us our national market share represented only 5 of new home sales in 2011  in each of our local markets there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with sales of existing house inventory and any provider of housing units for sale or to rent including apartment operators may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences 

seasonality 

our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings however the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results during 2011  we experienced a return to a somewhat more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year however given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry we can make no assurances as to when and to what degree our historical seasonality will recur 

regulation and environmental matters 

our operations are subject to extensive regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities these regulations are complex and include building codes land zoning and other entitlement restrictions health and safety regulations labor practices marketing and sales practices environmental regulations rules and regulations relating to mortgage financing operations and various other laws rules and regulations collectively these regulations have a significant impact on the site selection and development of our communities our house design and construction techniques our relationships with customers employees and suppliers  subcontractors and many other aspects of our business the applicable governing authorities frequently have broad discretion in administering these regulations including inspections of our homes prior to closing with the customer in the majority of municipalities in which we operate 

in addition to existing regulations more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance on december 1 2009 the environmental protection agency “epa” promulgated new regulations regarding effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for discharges from construction and development sites the new regulations require all construction sites subject to national pollutant discharge elimination system construction storm water permits issued by the epa or an authorized state to implement certain sediment and erosion controls and pollution prevention measures these regulations also require sampling of storm water discharges and compliance with a numeric effluent limitation of 280 nephelometric turbidity units “ntus” beginning august 1 2011 for sites disturbing 20 or more acres at once and beginning february 2 2014 for sites disturbing 10 or more acres at once effective january 4 2011 the effluent limitation standard of 280 ntus has been stayed by the epa until it can complete a new rulemaking to correct the numeric limitation the numeric limit is the only portion of the new regulations that has been stayed by the epa the epa published a federal register notice on january 3 2012 requesting additional data on the performance of technologies in controlling turbidity in stormwater discharges from construction sites comments will be accepted for sixty days no date has yet been set by epa for further rulemaking related to elg 

in addition to the new elg regulations the epa also announced that it is committed to and has begun a rulemaking to address postconstruction storm water discharges from newly developed and redeveloped sites this rulemaking is expected to be completed by november 2012 there can be no assurance whether the epa will adopt final rules regarding postconstruction storm water discharges or if it does the form the final rules will take we are currently assessing the impact that the new elg rules and potential postconstruction rules will have on our business and results of operations 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” or ginnie mae federal national mortgage association “fnma” or fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” or freddie mac and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fannie mae freddie mac and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

during 2011  2010  and 2009  we originated mortgage loans for 62  63  and 70  respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years as the primary purpose for our mortgage operations is to support our homebuilding business our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 785  in 2011  775  in 2010  and 853  in 2009  

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and subsequently sell such mortgage loans to outside investors substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination 

we sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 to 120 days after sale 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers we utilize a centralized fulfillment center staffed with loan consultants to perform our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency consistency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to the rules and regulations of the governmentsponsored investors and other investors that purchase the loans we originate in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations are also subject to potential losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a makewhole payment historically losses related to these representations were not significant beginning in 2009 we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell we have only limited risk associated with our title operations due to the low incidence of claims related to underwriting risk associated with issued title insurance policies and fiduciary risk resulting from closing services 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the united states however we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2011  we employed 3579  people of which 577  people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle which has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

prior to 2006 land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by severe weakness in new home sales attributable to among other factors weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and significant uncertainty in the global economy these conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes and heightened pricing pressures on new and existing home sales as a result of these factors we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability we have also incurred substantial impairments of our land inventory and certain other assets we cannot predict the duration or the severity of the current market conditions nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

as a result of the changing market conditions in the homebuilding industry that have occurred since early 2006 we incurred significant landrelated charges resulting from the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs related to land transactions we elected not to pursue net realizable valuation adjustments related to land positions sold or held for sale impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and impairments of our recorded goodwill it is reasonably possible that the estimated cash flows from our projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation adjustments additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets for additional impairments or writedowns which could result in additional charges that might be significant 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in the past we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan we may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of centex for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties 

to date the significant majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the origination market in 2006 and 2007 we originated 395 billion of loans excluding loans originated by centexs former subprime loan business sold by centex in 2006 

in addition we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centex’s mortgage operations which ceased loan origination activities in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by centex this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans 

the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could exceed existing estimates and accruals the repurchase liability we recorded is estimated based on several factors including the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments the economic environment and other circumstances some of which are beyond our control accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

a large majority of our customers finance their home purchases through mortgage loans many through our mortgage bank interest rates have been near historical lows for several years which has made new homes more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business beginning in early 2007 the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained as the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime alta and other nonconforming mortgage products our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

in addition the federal reserve has purchased a sizeable amount of mortgagebacked securities in part to stabilize mortgage interest rates and to support the market for mortgagebacked securities as the federal reserve reduces its holdings of mortgagebacked securities over time the availability and affordability of mortgage loans including the consumer interest rates for such loans could be adversely affected 

we also believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes the fha has and may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards raise minimum down payment requirements impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs andor limit the number of mortgages it insures the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years in many cases the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers we need liquidity for future growth and development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results at december 31 2011  we had cash and equivalents of 11 billion  as well as restricted cash totaling 1019 million  however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure at december 31 2011 we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaling 2359 million  and 12 billion  respectively of these amounts outstanding 832 million  of the letters of credit were subject to cashcollateralized agreements while the remaining letters of credit and surety bonds were unsecured if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of location price quality reputation design community amenities and our customers overall sales and homeownership experiences we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes or unfavorably impact pricing for new homes 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel concrete copper and petroleumbased materials is influenced by changes in global commodity prices increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we may not be able to pass on increases in construction costs to customers and generally are unable to pass on any such increases to customers who have already entered into sales contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any such additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our net income for such period 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are appropriately recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results if these reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income and executing tax planning strategies we have recorded valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowance will fluctuate as conditions change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we have not experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

as a result of the merger with centex our ability to use certain of centex’s preownership change nols bils or deductions is limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code the applicable section 382 limitation is approximately 674 million per year for nols losses realized on builtin loss assets that are sold within 60 months of the ownership change and certain deductions the limitation may result in a significant portion of centex’s preownership change nols bils and tax credit carryforwards or deductions not being available for our use 

the value of our deferred tax assets is also dependent upon the tax rates in effect at the time taxable income is expected to be generated a decrease in enacted corporate tax rates in our major jurisdictions especially the us federal corporate tax rate would decrease the value of our deferred tax assets which could be material 

we have significant intangible assets if these assets become impaired then our profits and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have significant intangible assets related to prior business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our operating earnings if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly impairments of the remaining intangible assets may occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations imposed and enforced by various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies pursuant to which those agencies may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the us could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the us or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend overview 

on august 18 2009  we completed the acquisition of centex through the merger of pultegroup’s merger subsidiary with and into centex pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of april 7 2009  among pultegroup pi nevada building company and centex as a result of the merger centex became a whollyowned subsidiary of pultegroup accordingly the results of centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger 

the us housing market and broader economy remain in a period of uncertainty while we have experienced some stabilization in our local markets homebuilding industry volumes remain at near historically low levels this more stable environment has resulted in a significant reduction in the level of landrelated charges recorded during 2011  compared with recent years however significant shortterm uncertainty remains such that we are not anticipating a broad recovery in homebuilding in the near term factors that are currently impacting the homebuilding industry negatively include 

 during 2011 we experienced a return to a somewhat more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year while our overall volumes in 2011 were moderately lower than in 2010 the combination of improved gross margins a more efficient overhead structure and lower asset impairment charges resulted in a significant improvement in our bottom line results we believe that improved employment levels and consumer confidence are necessary to unlock the pentup demand that we believe has built up in recent years accordingly we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term while also positioning ourselves to capitalize upon growth when industry conditions improve while we are purchasing land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so the opportunity to purchase developed lots in premium locations has become more limited and competitive in many of our markets we also continue to evaluate each of our existing land parcels to determine whether the strategy and economics support holding the parcel or disposing of it we have closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses since the beginning of the industry downturn including a further consolidation of our field organization and select corporate functions during 2011  due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions maintaining an efficient overhead structure will continue to be a significant area of focus we are also adjusting the content in our homes to provide our customers more affordable alternatives and are building homes with smaller floor plans in certain of our communities 

our outlook is cautious for 2012  as the timing of a sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry remains uncertain in the longterm we continue to believe that the national publiclytraded builders will have a competitive advantage over local builders through their ability to leverage economies of scale access to more reliable and lower cost financing through the capital markets ability to control and entitle large land positions and greater geographic and product diversification among the national publiclytraded peer group we believe that builders with more significant land positions broad geographic and product diversity and sustainable capital positions will benefit as market conditions recover in the shortterm we expect that market conditions will remain challenging and our visibility as to future earnings performance is limited our evaluations for landrelated charges recorded to date were based on our best estimates of the future cash flows for our communities if conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets for further impairments or writedowns which could result in future charges that might be significant 

the following is a summary of our operating results by line of business 000s omitted except per share data 



 

for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements 

mergerrelated costs represent transaction and integration costs resulting directly from the centex merger in total homebuilding incurred 1291 million  of such costs in 2009 these costs consisted of 570 million  of restructuring costs primarily severance and lease exit costs included in the above table within restructuring costs plus 721 million  of investment banking and other professional fees amortization of certain fair value adjustments and certain other integration costs 

in addition to the above charges homebuilding continued to experience low volumes in 2009  through 2011  the revenue decline for the year ended december 31 2011  was due in part to the impact of a federal homebuyer tax credit that existed during the first half of 2010  as well as lower average selling prices and fewer active communities in 2011  the lower revenue in 2011 and 2010 was partially offset by improved gross margins reduced overhead costs and lower impairment charges

centex merger 

as indicated above the centex merger had a significant impact on our postacquisition operating results centex was consolidated for the full year in our 2011 and 2010 operating results however if not for the impact of the centex merger our revenues closings and net new orders in 2010  would have experienced significant decreases from 2009  our reported home sale revenues closings and net new orders for 2010  as reflected in the above tables represent decreases of 19  22  and 28  respectively from the combined operating results of the two companies from 2009 however these lower volumes were offset by lower landrelated charges improved gross margins and operating leverage and our elimination of the substantial majority of duplicative overhead costs from the combined companies excluding the impact of the goodwill impairments and insurancerelated losses recorded in 2010 and 2009 our homebuilding income loss before income taxes in 2010  was significantly improved from the losses reported by either company or the combined companies in 2009 this illustrates the impact of the various actions we took to restructure our combined homebuilding operations into a more efficient organization as well as a somewhat more stable environment for the homebuilding industry albeit at lower industry volumes 

home sale revenues 

home sale revenues for 2011  were lower than 2010  by 4691 million  or 11  the decrease was attributable to an 11  decrease in closings as average selling prices remained stable from 2010  to 2011  the decline in closings for 2011  compared with 2010  occurred in each of our homebuilding segments except for florida and resulted primarily from lower industry volumes in part due to the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit that existed during 2010 for orders under contract by april 30 and closed by september 30 this tax credit favorably impacted new orders and closings during the first half of 2010 in part we believe by pulling forward customer demand the 11  decrease in our active communities also contributed to the lower closings 

home sale revenues for 2010  were higher than 2009  by 5505 million  or 14  the increase in home sale revenues in 2010  over 2009  was attributable to a 14  increase in closings as average selling prices remained stable from 2009  to 2010  as discussed above under centex merger  the increase in revenues in 2010 resulted from the centex merger which contributed 19 billion  in 2010  compared to 11 billion  in 2009  the federal homebuyer tax credit described above also contributed to increased revenues in the first half of 2010 which were partially offset by lower revenues in the second half of 2010 

home sale gross margins 

home sale gross margins were 128  in 2011  compared with 94  in 2010  and 105  in 2009  gross margins during 2011  benefited from lower land and community valuation adjustments of 159 million  compared with 1697 million  and 7512 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively the benefit of these lower charges was partially offset by increased amortization of capitalized interest due to debt assumed with the centex merger 

gross margins were also adversely impacted in 2009 by a fair value adjustment related to homes under construction inventory acquired in the centex merger we recognized this fair value adjustment as an increase of 311 million  to home sale cost of revenues as the related homes closed the amortization of this adjustment was not significant in 2011  or 2010  excluding the impact of land and community valuation adjustments amortization of capitalized interest and mergerrelated costs adjusted home sale gross margins improved to 179  in 2011  from 167  in 2010  and 123  in 2009  see the nongaap financial measures section for a reconciliation of adjusted home sale gross margins these improved gross margins reflect a combination of factors including shifts in the product and geographic mix of homes closed better alignment of our product offering with current market conditions and a shift in our sales strategy toward more “preselling” of homes 

land sales 

we periodically elect to sell parcels of land to third parties in the event such assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans or are zoned for commercial or other development land sale revenues and their related gains or losses vary between periods depending on the timing of land sales and our strategic operating decisions land sales had margin contributions of 236 million  257 million  and 1139 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively these margin contributions included net realizable value adjustments related to land held for sale totaling 98 million  391 million  and 1137 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively 

sga 

in order to further reduce overhead costs and drive greater leverage we reconfigured our organization during the fourth quarter of 2010 and again in the second quarter of 2011 consolidating certain local divisions along with these changes in our field operations we also further reduced corporate and support staffing across a number of functions to further consolidate and streamline our operating processes these actions were a continuation of a series of actions we have taken over the last several years to better align our overhead structure with expected volumes 

the gross dollar amount of our sga decreased 3755 million  or 42  in 2011  compared to 2010  sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 132  in 2011  compared with 203  in 2010  sga in 2010  included 2804 million  in insurance reserve adjustments substantially all of which related to general liability construction defect claims see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of insurance reserve adjustments sga as a percentage of home sales revenues excluding these insurance reserve adjustments was 132  and 139  in 2011  and 2010  respectively see the nongaap financial measures section for a reconciliation of sga as a percentage of home sale revenue excluding insurance reserve adjustments excluding the insurance reserve adjustments from 2010 our sga declined significantly in gross dollars in 2011  and resulted in an improvement in overhead leverage this improved overhead leverage resulted from a combination of better matching our overall cost structure with the current business environment and lower severance and equity compensation expense in 2011  

the gross dollar amount of our sga increased 2227 million  or 33  in 2010  compared to 2009  sga as a percentage of home sale revenues was 203  in 2010  compared with 174  in 2009  the increase in 2010  compared to 2009  was the result of the insurance reserve adjustments taken in 2010  noted above sga as a percentage of home sales revenues excluding these insurance reserve adjustments was 139  and 174  in 2010  and 2009  respectively this decrease resulted primarily from lower severance costs and the elimination of certain overhead costs directly related to the centex merger that impacted 2009 in 2010  sga included severance costs of 223 million  during 2009  sga included transaction and integration costs related to the centex merger including severance costs totaling 705 million  as well as certain duplicative corporate and divisional overhead costs during the transition period following the merger 

equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities 

equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities was 32 million  28 million  and 497 million  for 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively the primary cause for this change in results is the lower levels of impairments related to these entities recorded during 2011  and 2010  as compared to 2009  there were no  impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in 2011  while impairments totaled 19 million  and 541 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively the majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures as a result the timing of income and losses varies between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity 

other expense income net 

other expense income net includes the following 000’s omitted 



for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements miscellaneous expense income net includes 171 million in 2011  related to the writedown of a note receivable 

interest income net 

the decrease in interest income net in 2011  compared with 2010  resulted from lower invested cash balances that resulted primarily from the significant debt retirements we completed in 2011  and 2010  the slight decrease in interest income net in 2010  compared with 2009  resulted from higher invested cash balances offset by lower interest rates additionally 15 million  of homebuilding interest costs were expensed directly to interest expense in 2010  because our debt balance exceeded the amount of active inventory for certain periods and thus was not capitalized into inventory 

net new orders 

net new order levels were essentially flat for 2011  compared with 2010  net new orders reflect the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit that expired during 2010 which favorably impacted new orders during the first half of 2010 and the reduced number of active communities in 2011 at december 31 2011  we had 700  active communities a decrease of 11  from december 31 2010  the cancellation rate canceled orders for the period divided by gross new orders for the period for 2011  was unchanged from 2010  at 19  ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was essentially flat at december 31 2011  compared with december 31 2010  consistent with the overall new order levels 

for 2010  net new orders increased 7  compared with 2009  primarily due to incremental orders resulting from the centex merger and the positive impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit in the first half of 2010 partially offset in the latter half of 2010 by a lower average sales pace per community excluding centex net new order units decreased moderately during 2010  due to the uncertainty in the overall us housing industry cancellation rates were slightly lower in 2010  at 19  compared to 23  in 2009  at december 31 2010  we had 786  active selling communities a decrease of 11  from december 31 2009  ending backlog at december 31 2010  declined 33  from december 31 2009  as the result of the lower community count and the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which pulled forward demand into the first half of 2010 

homes in production 

the following is a summary of our homes in production at december 31 2011  and 2010  



included in our total homes in production were 2862  and 3494  homes that were unsold to customers “spec homes” at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively of which 1481  and 1856  homes respectively were completed “final specs” the reduction in homes in production at december 31 2011  compared to 2010  resulted primarily from our lower community count combined with a conscious effort to reduce the number of spec homes especially final specs 

controlled lots 

the following is a summary of our lots under control at december 31 2011  and 2010  



of our controlled lots 116933  and 131964  were owned and 10060  and 10082  were under option agreements approved for purchase at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively in addition there were 4017  and 5148  lots under option agreements pending approval at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively while we are purchasing land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so the reduction in lots resulting from closings land disposition activity and withdrawals from land option contracts exceeded the number of lots added by new transactions during the year ended december 31 2011  

the remaining purchase price related to land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated 6980 million  at december 31 2011  these land option agreements which may be canceled at our discretion and may extend over several years are secured by deposits and preacquisition costs totaling 570 million  of which only 46 million  is refundable this balance excludes contingent payment obligations which may or may not become actual obligations to us 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information about our home sale gross margins and selling general and administrative expenses “sga” reflecting certain adjustments these measures are considered nongaap financial measures under the secs rules and should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the comparable gaap financial measures as measures of our operating performance management and our local divisions use these measures in evaluating the operating performance of each community and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing construction and development pace product mix and other daily operating decisions we believe they are relevant and useful measures to investors for evaluating our performance through 1 gross profit generated on homes delivered during a given period and 2 the efficiency of our overhead cost structure and for comparing our operating performance to other companies in the homebuilding industry although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information the methods used may differ we urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate gross margins and sga and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to that of such other companies 

the following tables set forth reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the gaap financial measures that management believes to be most directly comparable 000s omitted

 northeast 

for 2011  northeast home sale revenues decreased 5  compared with 2010  due to a 10  decrease in closings offset in part by a 5  increase in the average selling price the reduction in closing volumes was primarily due to fewer closings in our midatlantic division in part due to a lower active community count the decreased income before income taxes was primarily due to expense of 219 million  in 2011  related to the writedown of a note receivable and the unfavorable resolution of certain contingencies such expense was partially offset by improved gross margin compared to the prior year landrelated charges were comparable between periods totaling 50 million  in 2011  compared with 42 million  in 2010  net new order units increased 6  in 2011  led by our operations in the northeast corridor and midatlantic 

for 2010  northeast home sale revenues increased 18  compared with 2009  due to a 19  increase in closings offset slightly by a 1  decrease in the average selling price the majority of the increase in volumes resulted from increased sales in our midatlantic division excluding centex home sale revenues and closings decreased moderately while average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009  the income before income taxes was primarily attributable to higher revenues increased gross margin improved overhead leverage compared with 2009  and a decrease in landrelated charges to 42 million  in 2010  compared with 2019 million  in 2009  net new orders decreased 5  compared with 2009  due to decreased activity in our northeast corridor division excluding centex net new orders decreased moderately compared with 2009  

southeast 

for 2011  southeast home sale revenues decreased 10  compared with 2010  due to a 10  decrease in closings as there was no  change in the average selling price the reduction in closing volumes was primarily due to fewer closings in our georgia division as well as a lower active community count across all divisions gross margin improved compared with the prior year period the increased income before income taxes was also due to lower landrelated charges which totaled 24 million  in 2011  compared with 141 million  in 2010  net new order units decreased 4  in 2011  due in part to decreased activity in our tennessee division 

for 2010  southeast home sale revenues increased 34  compared with 2009  due to a 35  increase in closings as there was no  change in the average selling price the increase in closing volumes was largely due to significant increases in our sales volumes in our coastal carolinas and tennessee divisions due to the centex merger excluding centex home sale revenues and average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009  and there was no change in closings the income before income taxes was primarily attributable to higher revenues increased gross margin improved overhead leverage compared with 2009  and a decrease in landrelated charges to 141 million  in 2010  from 542 million  in 2009  new orders increased 20  compared with 2009  largely due to the centex merger excluding centex net new orders decreased moderately compared with 2009  

florida 

for 2011  florida home sale revenues increased 3  compared with 2010  due to a 1  increase in closings combined with a 2  increase in the average selling price the majority of this improvement was due to increased closing volumes in north florida the income before income taxes in 2011  was attributable to improved gross margins and significantly lower landrelated charges than in 2010  landrelated charges were 40 million  in 2011  compared with 568 million  in 2010  net new order units increased by 13  in 2011  in part due to grand openings or grand reopenings at several large communities 

for 2010  florida home sale revenues increased 22  compared with 2009  due to a 13  increase in closings combined with a 8  increase in the average selling price the majority of this improvement was due to our south florida market as our north florida market experienced a significant reduction in revenues excluding centex home sale revenues decreased slightly closings decreased moderately and average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009  the significant decrease in loss before income taxes in 2010  was attributable to higher revenues and lower landrelated charges which totaled 568 million  and 2503 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively gross margins increased moderately compared with 2009  net new orders increased by 11  compared with 2009  primarily due to increased activity in our south florida market due to the centex merger excluding centex net new orders for 2010  decreased moderately from 2009  

texas 

for 2011  texas home sale revenues decreased 4  compared with the prior year period due to a 7  decrease in closings partially offset by a 3  increase in the average selling price the reduction in closing volumes was mainly due to central texas and san antonio the increased income before income taxes in 2011  was attributable to improved gross margins and lower landrelated charges than in the prior year period landrelated charges were 08 million  in 2011  compared with 68 million  in 2010  net new order units increased by 5  for 2011  in part due to the grand opening of a large community in houston

north 

for 2011  north home sale revenues decreased 16  compared with the prior year period due to a 16  decrease in closings as there was no  change in average selling price the decrease in closing volumes was due to significantly fewer closings in our minnesota st louis and northern california divisions gross margin decreased slightly the loss before income taxes was primarily due to the reduced revenues offset in part by reduced landrelated charges landrelated charges totaled 149 million  in 2011  compared with 281 million  in 2010  net new order units decreased by 3  in 2011  compared with 2010  primarily in our minnesota st louis and northern california divisions the sales volumes for our northern california division reflect the impact of the state homebuyer tax credit that existed in california during 2010  the expiration of this tax credit exacerbated the already challenging local market conditions these declines were partially offset by improvements in our other north divisions 

for 2010  north home sale revenues increased 13  compared with 2009  due to a 12  increase in closings combined with a 1  increase in the average selling price the increase in closing volumes was due to increased sales in our pacific northwest and st louis divisions due to the centex merger excluding centex home sale revenues and closings decreased slightly while average selling price increased slightly compared with 2009  in 2010  north recorded landrelated charges totaling 281 million  compared to landrelated charges of 973 million  in 2009  gross margins increased moderately compared with 2009  net new orders increased by 14  compared with 2009  primarily due to increased activity in our indianapolis st louis and minnesota markets largely due to the centex merger excluding centex net new orders for 2010  decreased moderately compared to 2009  

southwest 

for 2011  southwest home sale revenues decreased 24  compared with the prior year period due to a 20  decrease in closings and a 6  decrease in average selling price the decreases were due to weakness in each of our divisions combined with the closeout in late 2010  of our luxury condo community in hawaii that had average selling prices in excess of 1 million the increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to improved gross margins and the significant decrease in landrelated charges landrelated charges totaled 33 million  in 2011  compared with 781 million  in 2010  the southwest also benefited from land sale gains totaling 155 million  in 2011  net new order units decreased by 9  in 2011  compared with 2010  due to the closeout of our community in hawaii as well as reduced activity in our las vegas and southern california markets the sales volumes for our southern california division reflect the impact of the state homebuyer tax credit that existed in california during 2010  the expiration of this tax credit exacerbated the already challenging local market conditions 

for 2010  southwest home sale revenues decreased 11  compared with 2009  due to a 16  decrease in closings partially offset by a 6  increase in average selling price the majority of the decline in volumes was due to our las vegas and arizona markets excluding centex home sale revenues and closings decreased significantly while average sales price was unchanged compared with 2009  the decreased loss before income taxes in 2010  compared with 2009  was attributable primarily to lower landrelated charges of 781 million  in 2010  compared with 2880 million  in 2009  as well as moderately improved gross margins net new orders decreased by 20  in 2010  compared with 2009  primarily due to declines in las vegas and arizona excluding centex net new orders for 2010  decreased significantly compared to 2009  

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and funds available pursuant to a repurchase agreement with the company we subsequently sell such mortgage loans to outside investors substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination we sell the servicing rights for the loans we originate on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks and costs inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 to 120 days after sale 

the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

  

operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the operating results of our financial services operations are highly correlated to homebuilding since 2007 the mortgage industry has experienced a significant overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production and fixed rate loans versus adjustable rate mortgages “arms” our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production representing 99  of loan originations for 2011  and 98  of loan originations for both 2010  and 2009  

revenues 

total financial services revenues during 2011  decreased 15  compared to 2010  due in large part to a 12  decrease in loan origination volumes compared to 2010  resulting from lower homebuilding volumes interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was moderately lower in 2011  than in 2010  due to lower interest rates on loans originated 

financial services revenues during 2010  increased 3  compared with 2009  primarily as a result of improved loan pricing in 2010  compared to 2009  interest income was lower in 2010  than in 2009  due to a combination of lower interest rates and selling loans faster in 2010  

the substantial majority of loan production in 2011  2010  and 2009  consisted of fixed rate loans the majority of which are prime conforming loans the shift toward agency fixedrate loans has contributed to profitability as such loans generally result in higher profitability due to higher servicing values less competition and structured guidelines that allow for expense efficiencies when processing the loan additionally the historically low interest rates of the last two years has contributed to profitability by reducing the level of pricing competition in the market our capture rate which represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash closings decreased in 2011  and 2010  from 2009  

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

historically our overall losses relating to this risk were not significant beginning in 2009 however we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market during 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded additional provisions for losses as a change in estimate primarily to reflect projected claim volumes in excess of previous estimates losses related to loan origination liabilities totaled 593 million  169 million  and 609 million  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively and are reflected in financial services expenses given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates see our critical accounting policies and estimates  and note 15  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centexs mortgage operations which ceased loan origination activities in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor of loans originated by centex this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centexs mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans other than with respect to this pool of loans our contractual repurchase obligations are limited to our mortgage subsidiaries which are included in nonguarantor subsidiaries see note 16  for a discussion of nonguarantor subsidiaries 

the mortgage subsidiary of centex also sold loans to a bank for inclusion in residential mortgagebacked securities “rmbss” issued by the bank in connection with these sales centexs mortgage subsidiary entered into agreements pursuant to which it may be required to indemnify the bank for losses incurred by investors in the rmbss arising out of material errors or omissions in certain information provided by the mortgage subsidiary relating to the loans and loan origination process the bank has notified us that it has been named defendant in two lawsuits alleging various violations of federal and state securities laws asserting that untrue statements of material fact were included in the registration statements used to market the sale of two rmbs transactions which included 162 million  of loans originated by centexs mortgage subsidiary neither centexs mortgage subsidiary nor the company is named as a defendant in these actions these actions are in their preliminary stage and we cannot yet quantify centexs mortgage subsidiarys potential liability as a result of these indemnification obligations we do not believe however that these matters will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial position or 

cash flows of the company we are aware of six other rmbs transactions with such indemnity provisions that include an aggregate 116 million  of loans and we are not aware of any current or threatened legal proceedings regarding those transactions 

income before income taxes 

the loss before income taxes in 2011  was due to increased loss reserves related to contingent loan origination liabilities see loan origination liabilities  above in addition loan loss provisions related to our portfolio loans real estate owned and mortgage reinsurance reserves totaled 17 million  and 12 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively excluding these aggregate losses our financial services segment experienced higher profitability during 2011  primarily as the result of improved loan pricing 

income before income taxes increased significantly in 2010  compared with 2009  primarily due to lower expenses related to contingent loan origination liabilities see loan origination liabilities above in addition loan loss provisions related to our portfolio loans real estate owned and mortgage reinsurance reserves totaled 12 million  and 98 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively the 2009  loss before income taxes also included certain integration costs directly related to the centex merger totaling 84 million  which consisted primarily of severance benefits and lease exit and related asset impairment costs 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is affected by a number of factors the most significant of which are the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits our effective tax rates were a benefit of 322  112  and 401  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively due to the effect of our valuation allowance and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits our effective tax rates for 2009  through 2011  are not correlated to the amount of our pretax loss 

the income tax benefits for 2011  and 2010  were primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters our 2009  income tax benefit was primarily due to the impact of the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 the “act” the act allowed us to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisition development and construction activities and financial services operations by using internallygenerated funds and existing credit arrangements we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate accessing other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if market conditions deteriorate or if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations 

at december 31 2011  we had cash and equivalents of 11 billion  and senior notes of 31 billion  we also had restricted cash balances of 1019 million  the substantial majority of which related to cash serving as collateral under certain letter of credit facilities other financing sources include various letter of credit facilities and surety bond arrangements in recent years an additional source of liquidity has been refunds of federal income taxes paid in prior years especially in 2010 as a result of the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 

we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm investments generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities we monitor our investments with each bank and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 614  at december 31 2011  and 495  net of cash and equivalents including restricted cash while these debttocapital ratios remain above our desired targets they are not likely to improve significantly until we return to consistent profitability 

credit agreements 

we maintain an unsecured letter of credit facility expiring in june 2014  that permits the issuance of up to 2000 million  of letters of credit at december 31 2011  1527 million  of letters of credit were outstanding under this facility 

on march 25 2011  we voluntarily terminated our 2500 million  unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” the termination was effective march 30 2011  the credit facility was scheduled to expire in june 2012  and we did not pay any penalties as a result of the early termination although we did record a charge of 13 million  related to unamortized issuance costs the credit facility had no outstanding borrowings and was being used solely to issue letters of credit we determined it would be more cost effective to enter into separate cashcollateralized letter of credit agreements than to maintain the credit facility the termination of the credit facility released 2500 million  of cash that we were required by the credit facility to maintain in liquidity reserve accounts 

in connection with the termination of the credit facility we entered into separate cashcollateralized letter of credit agreements with a number of financial institutions these agreements provide capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to  1912 million  the majority of which is uncommitted letters of credit totaling 832 million  were outstanding under these agreements at december 31 2011  under these agreements we are required to maintain deposits with these financial institutions in amounts approximating the letters of credit outstanding such deposits are included in restricted cash 

pulte mortgage 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for the majority of our home closings by using its own funds and funds available pursuant to a repurchase agreement with the company pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors which generally occurs within 30 days given our liquidity position and the cost of third party financing relative to existing mortgage rates pulte mortgage allowed each of its third party borrowing arrangements to expire during 2010 and began funding its operations using company resources at december 31 2011  we funded 1273 million  of pulte mortgages financing needs via the repurchase agreement with the company 

stock repurchase programs 

pursuant to the two 100 million  stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october 2002  and october 2005  and the 200 million  stock repurchase authorization in february 2006  for a total stock repurchase authorization of 400 million  we have repurchased a total of 9688900  shares for a total of 2977 million  there have been no repurchases under these programs since 2006 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 1023 million  at december 31 2011  

dividends 

on november 24 2008 our board of directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on the companys common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009 future dividends will depend upon a variety of factors considered relevant by the board of directors including our earnings capital requirements financial condition market conditions and other factors 

cash flows 

in the years 2009  and 2010  we generated significant positive cash flow through refunds of income taxes paid in prior year combined with cash acquired in the centex merger and limiting the level of reinvestment into inventory we used this positive cash flow to among other things maintain significant cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt over the last three years we have retired 32 billion  of debt including debt assumed in the centex merger see note 8  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding these retirements additionally we used  266 million  and 1112 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively to repurchase at a discount prior to their maturity certain community development district obligations in order to improve the future financial performance of the related communities see note 15  to the consolidated financial statements and also voluntarily used company funds to finance pulte mortgage’s lending operations 

we do not anticipate that we will be able to generate positive cash flow in the near future at the same levels as in 2009  and 2010  during 2011  we generated positive operating cash flow however should growth conditions return to the homebuilding industry we may need to invest significant capital into our operations to support such growth

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2011  was 172 million  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 5909 million  and 7294 million  in 2010  and 2009  respectively generally the primary drivers of cash flow from operations are profitability and inventory levels the net losses for 2011  2010  and 2009  were largely the result of noncash asset impairments and insurance reserve adjustments so the cash flows from operations each period primarily relate to changes in working capital our positive cash flow from operations in 2011  was primarily the result of a net decrease in inventories combined with income tax refunds net of payments of 622 million  offset by financing pulte mortgages lending operations which reduced cash flows from operations by 528 million  in 2011  

our positive cash flow from operations for 2010  was primarily the result of income tax refunds net of payments of 9413 million  after adjusting for these tax refunds operating cash flow was negative for 2010  cash flows from operations in 2010 were negatively impacted by the voluntary repurchase of certain community development district obligations for 1112 million  see above and using 745 million  to finance pulte mortgages lending operations during 2010  inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale decreased slightly operating cash flows in 2009  benefited from a significant net decrease in inventory and residential mortgage loans availableforsale along with income tax refunds net of payments of 3572 million  

because we used company resources to finance pulte mortgages operations during 2011  the majority of cash flows related to pulte mortgage are now included in cash flows from operating activities represented primarily by changes in the balance of residential mortgage loans availableforsale previously including in 2009  changes in the balance of residential mortgage loans availableforsale were largely offset by changes in borrowings under pulte mortgages credit arrangements which were included in cash flows from financing activities 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 936 million  in 2011  compared with net cash used in investing activities of 195 million  in 2010  and net cash provided by investing activities of 17 billion  in 2009  the increase from 2010  to 2011  is primarily due to the 832 million  of restricted cash we are now required to maintain related to our new letter of credit facilities offset in part by increased proceeds from the sale of fixed assets related to the consolidation of certain facilities and a decrease in contributions to unconsolidated entities our contributions to unconsolidated entities and investments in capital expenditures have declined in recent years as the result of the reduction in our overall land investments and consolidations of local operating facilities 

the net cash used in investing activities in 2010  was primarily the result of investments in unconsolidated entities and capital expenditures partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated entities and a reduction in residential mortgage loans held for investment substantially all of the cash provided by investing activities in 2009  was the result of cash acquired in the centex merger 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 3239 million  9484 million  and 22 billion  in 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively cash used in financing activities in 2011  related primarily to the use of  3211 million  to reduce outstanding senior notes of which 139 million  was at their scheduled maturity date while the remainder was prior to their scheduled maturity dates 

net cash used in financing activities in 2010  was primarily the result of the repurchase of senior notes as well as repayments made under financial services credit arrangements as discussed above we are now using internal funds to finance pulte mortgages operations the effects of which are reflected in cash flows from operating activities 

the cash used in financing activities in 2009  was largely attributable to 19 billion  used to retire outstanding debt combined with reductions in amounts outstanding under our financial services credit arrangements resulting from the reduction in mortgage loans availableforsale 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass on to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices current industry conditions have resulted in significant pressure on sales prices in many of our markets if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly our revenues gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 

seasonality 

we experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry historically we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home closings however the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results during 2011 we experienced a return to a somewhat more traditional demand pattern as new orders were higher in the first half of the year and home closings increased in each quarter throughout the year however given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry we can make no assurances as to when and to what degree our historical seasonality will recur 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2011  

  

 we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our option which may serve to reduce our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2011  we had 525 million  of nonrefundable deposits and preacquisition costs relating to option agreements to acquire 14077  homesites with a remaining purchase price of 6980 million  we expect to acquire approximately half of these lots within the next two years and the remainder thereafter 

at december 31 2011  we had 1719 million  of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 369 million  of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 1998  2011  

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2011  



 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2011  we had outstanding letters of credit of 2359 million  surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 12 billion  at december 31 2011  are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years because significant construction and development work has been performed related to the applicable projects but has not yet received final acceptance by the respective counterparties the aggregate amount of surety bonds outstanding is in excess of the projected cost of the remaining work to be performed 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2011  these agreements had an aggregate remaining purchase price of 6980 million  pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices in certain instances we are required to record the land under option as if we own it at december 31 2011  we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of 249 million  as land not owned under option agreements 

at december 31 2011  aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 111 million  of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was 32 million  of our proportionate share of joint venture debt we provided limited recourse guaranties for 12 million  at december 31 2011  see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1  of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding  – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by asc 36020 “property plant and equipment  real estate sales” the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services  – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected 

gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services revenues at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory valuation 

inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value as determined in accordance with asc 36010 “property plant and equipment – impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “asc 36010” accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of home closings 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

in accordance with asc 36010 we record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of discounted cash models and market comparable transactions where available these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

investments in unconsolidated entities 

we have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities including joint ventures with independent third parties many of these unconsolidated entities purchase develop andor sell land and homes in the united states and puerto rico the equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20 and not more than 50 under the equity method of accounting we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities certain of these entities sell land to us in these situations we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold the cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20 ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with asc 323 “investments – equity method and joint ventures” if we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary we write down the investment to its estimated fair value any such losses are recorded to equity in earnings loss of 

unconsolidated entities additionally each unconsolidated entity evaluates its longlived assets such as inventory for recoverability in accordance with asc 36010 our proportionate share of any such impairments under asc 36010 are also recorded to equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities evaluations of recoverability under both asc 323 and asc 36010 are primarily based on projected cash flows supplemented by market comparable transactions where available due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loans held for investment consist of a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing these loans are carried at cost and are reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful 

loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors losses a “makewhole” payment 

we sell a substantial majority of the loans we originate to investors each month retaining limited risk related to such loans historically our overall losses relating to this risk were not significant beginning in 2009 however we experienced a significant increase in losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us to date the significant majority of these losses relates to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 during which period inherently riskier loan products became more common in the mortgage origination market in 2006 and 2007 we originated 395 billion  of loans excluding loans originated by centexs former subprime loan business sold by centex in 2006 because we generally do not retain the servicing rights to the loans we originate information regarding the current and historical performance credit quality and outstanding balances of such loans is limited estimating these loan origination liabilities is further complicated by uncertainties surrounding numerous external factors such as various macroeconomic factors including unemployment rates and changes in home prices actions taken by third parties including the parties servicing the loans and the us federal government in its dual capacity as regulator of the us mortgage industry and conservator of the governmentsponsored enterprises commonly known as fannie mae and freddie mac which own or guarantee the majority of mortgage loans in the us 

most requests received to date relate to makewhole payments on loans that have been foreclosed generally after a portion of the loan principal had been paid down which reduces our exposure requests not immediately refuted by us undergo extensive analysis to confirm the exposure attempt to cure the identified defect and when necessary determine our liability we establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon among other things the level of current unresolved repurchase requests the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase determining these estimates and the resulting liability requires a significant level of management judgment we are generally able to cure or refute over 60  of the requests received from investors such that repurchases or makewhole payments are not required for those requests requiring repurchases or makewhole payments actual loss severities generally approximate 50  of the outstanding principal balance 

 our current estimates assume that claim volumes will not decline to pre2009 levels until after 2013 an extension of two years beyond our previous estimates as of december 31 2010 given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates for example if the total number of loans we are required to repurchase is ultimately 10 lower or higher than our current estimates the amount of future losses would decrease or increase by approximately 130 million 

intangible assets 

we have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the centex merger completed in 2009 and the del webb merger completed in 2001 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives the carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists if the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value while the industry downturn in recent years has resulted in a decline in the fair value of these intangible assets this decline has not yet resulted in an impairment of the assets carrying values however if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of the intangible assets changes the related intangible assets may be impaired 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

selfinsured risks 

we maintain and require our subcontractors to maintain general liability insurance coverage we also maintain builders risk property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance coverage these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims however we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and claims in excess of available insurance policy limits 

our general liability insurance includes coverage for certain construction defects while construction defect claims can relate to a variety of circumstances the majority of our claims relate to alleged problems with siding plumbing foundations and other concrete work windows roofing and heating ventilation and air conditioning systems the availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited and the insurance policies available require companies to maintain higher per occurrence and aggregate retention levels in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a projectspecific insurance program provided by the company policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represent selfinsurance of these risks by the company this selfinsured exposure is limited by reinsurance policies that we purchase general liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex and our coverage varies from policy year to policy year we are selfinsured for a per occurrence deductible which is capped at an overall aggregate retention level beginning with the first dollar amounts paid on insured claims satisfy our per occurrence and aggregate retention obligations any amounts incurred in excess of the occurrence or aggregate retention levels are covered by insurance up to our purchased coverage levels our insurance policies including the captive insurance subsidiaries reinsurance policies are maintained with highlyrated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant 

at any point in time we are managing over 1000 individual claims related to general liability property errors and omission workers compensation and other business insurance coverage we reserve for costs associated with such claims including expected claims management expenses relating to legal fees expert fees and claims handling expenses on an undiscounted basis at the time product revenue is recognized for each home closing and evaluate the recorded liabilities based on actuarial analyses of our historical claims the actuarial analyses calculate an estimate of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses including estimates for incurred but not reported losses ibnr ibnr represents losses related to claims incurred but not yet reported plus development on reported claims these estimates make up a significant portion of our liability and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of its costs under various insurance policies or from its subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable 

the recorded reserves include loss estimates related to both i existing claims and related claim expenses and ii ibnr and related claim expenses liabilities related to ibnr and related claim expenses represented approximately 78  of the total general liability reserves which represent the vast majority of the total recorded reserves at both december 31 2011  and 2010  the actuarial analyses that determine the ibnr portion of reserves consider a variety of factors including the frequency and severity of losses which are based on our historical claims experience supplemented by industry data the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates and claims management expenses 

adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs because the majority of our recorded reserves relates to ibnr adjustments to reserve amounts for individual existing claims generally do not impact the recorded reserves materially however changes in the frequency and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values can impact the underlying inputs and trends utilized in the actuarial analyses which could have a material impact on the recorded reserves 

we have experienced a high level of insurancerelated expenses in recent years primarily due to the adverse development of general liability claims the frequency and severity of which have increased significantly over historical levels during 2010 we experienced a greater than anticipated frequency of newly reported claims and a significant increase in specific case reserves related to certain known claims the general nature of these claims was not out of the ordinary but the frequency and severity of the claims were in excess of our historical experience as a result of these unfavorable trends we recorded additional reserves totaling  2804 million   074  per basic and diluted share within selling general and administrative expenses substantially all of this additional reserve related to general liability exposures a large portion of which resulted from revising our actuarial assumptions surrounding the longterm frequency severity and development of claims during the industry downturn over the last several years and especially in 2010 we experienced adverse claim frequency and severity compared with longer term averages in 2010 we deemed it appropriate to assume that the longterm future frequency severity and development of claims will most closely resemble the claims activity experienced in recent years 

our recorded reserves for all such claims totaled  7414 million  and  7856 million  at december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively the vast majority of which relate to general liability claims because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating future losses related to these claims actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs based on the actuarial analyses performed we believe the range of reasonably possible losses related to these claims is 650 million to 850 million while this range represents our best estimate of our ultimate liability related to these claims due to a variety of factors including those factors described above there can be no assurance that the ultimate costs realized by us will fall within this range 

income taxes 

we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration and tax planning alternatives the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements asc 740 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and settlements of audit issues

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financings to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2011 and 2010 our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value 000’s omitted 



derivative instruments and hedging activities 

pulte mortgage is exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and canceled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2011  this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60  days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment principally cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities and whole loan investor commitments we enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments changes in the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and the other derivative financial instruments are recognized in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results 

special notes concerning forwardlooking statements

disclosure controls and procedures 

management including our chairman president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2011  based upon and as of the date of that evaluation our chairman president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2011  

internal control over financial reporting 

 management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed 

management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation additionally because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

in order to ensure that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of december 31 2011  management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management asserts that the company has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  

ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the company’s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report has issued its report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  

 the board of directors and shareholders of pultegroup inc 

we have audited pultegroup inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria pultegroup inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion pultegroup inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of pultegroup inc as of december 31 2011  and 2010  and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011  and our report dated february 9 2012  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item i business 

pultegroup inc 

on march 18 2010 we changed our name from pulte homes inc to pultegroup inc “pultegroup” or the “company” pultegroup is a publiclyheld holding company traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “phm” we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states pultegroup is a michigan corporation organized in 1956 though our founder began our homebuilding operations in 1950 while our subsidiaries engage primarily in the homebuilding business we also have mortgage banking operations conducted principally through pulte mortgage llc “pulte mortgage” and title operations 

on august 18 2009 we completed the acquisition of centex corporation “centex” through the merger of pultegroup’s merger subsidiary with and into centex pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of april 7 2009 among pultegroup pi nevada building company and centex as a result of the merger centex became a whollyowned subsidiary of pultegroup accordingly the results of centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger 

since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures among other factors when combined with significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and uncertainty in the united states economy in recent periods these conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes slower sales and heightened pricing pressures to attract homebuyers as a result we have experienced a pretax loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006 such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments 

homebuilding our core business is engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the continental united states and the construction of housing on such land targeted for firsttime first and second moveup and active adult home buyers in the fourth quarter of 2010 we realigned the organizational structure for certain of our areas as a result our reportable homebuilding segments are as follows 

 

 we also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations our financial services segment operates generally in the same geographic markets as our homebuilding segments 

financial information for each of our reportable business segments is included in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements

homebuilding operations 

 

 through our brands which include pulte homes del webb centex and divosta we offer a wide variety of home designs including singlefamily detached townhouses condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to all of our major customer segments firsttime first and second moveup and active adult over our 61year history we have delivered over 575000 homes 

as of december 31 2010 our homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in nearly 800 communities sales prices of unit settlements during 2010 ranged from less than 100000 to greater than 10 million with 89 falling within the range of 100000 to 400000 the average unit selling price in 2010 was 259000 compared with 258000 in 2009 284000 in 2008 322000 in 2007 and 337000 in 2006 the significant decrease in the average selling price of our homes since 2006 resulted from a combination of pricing pressures due to challenging industry conditions and a shift in product mix toward more firsttime buyers 

sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 79 in 2010 compared with 77 in 2009 75 in 2008 and 74 in both 2007 and 2006 the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses condominiums and other attached housing as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for firsttime and active adult homebuyers our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result help to insulate us from demand changes in individual markets since 2006 however such diversification has not insulated us from demand changes due to the nationwide downturn in the homebuilding industry that has had a significant adverse impact on operations in each of our markets as of december 31 2010 our homebuilding business operated in 67 markets spanning 29 states and the district of columbia 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 11 billion 3984 units at december 31 2010 and 16 billion 5931 units at december 31 2009 for each order in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and the required customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2010 substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2011 though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose to refund the deposit in certain instances 

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers though we periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development additionally we may determine that certain land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing a feasibility study which includes among other things soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work an evaluation of the necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements and extensive market research that enables us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we frequently manage a portion of the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of option contracts we typically acquire land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period as a result of the downturn in the homebuilding industry that began in 2006 however our supply of controlled land is in excess of our shortterm needs in many of our markets 

land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in the normal course of business we dispose of owned land not required by our homebuilding operations through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

land acquisition and development continued 

  

site planning and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2010 we controlled 147194 lots of which 131964 were owned and 15230 were under option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group 

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in home design and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features we typically offer a variety of potential options and upgrades such as different flooring countertop and appliance choices and design our base house and option packages to meet the needs of our customers as defined through rigorous market research 

typically our sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the construction field manager 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup after the close of the home and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our financial services operations 

through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults which is among the fastest growing homebuying segments we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these highly amenitized communities offer a variety of features including golf courses recreational centers and educational classes to the over age fiftyfive buyer to maintain an active lifestyle 

through our portfolio of brands each serving unique customer segments we are able to provide a distinct experience to potential customers we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements mobile applications and other advertising displays in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom wwwcentexcom and wwwdivostacom provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us approximately 65 million potential customers visited our websites during 2010 

construction 

the construction process for our homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers substantially all of our construction work is performed by independent subcontractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we believe that our subcontractors and material suppliers are an extension of our 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

construction continued 

  

production system and jointly focus on lean construction techniques to bring the highest value possible to our customers while maintaining strong trade relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier subcontractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the house construction process 

we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices we continue to shift toward component offsite manufacturing methods for certain portions of the construction process to provide high efficiency high quality and lower cost products to our customers to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain materials on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives 

we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future while the availability of materials and labor is not a significant concern under current market conditions we have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets in previous years 

competition regulation and other factors 

our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is fragmented and highly competitive in each of our local markets there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with sales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units for sale or to rent including apartment operators may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of location price reputation design community amenities and the quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in the costs of building materials and labor 3 changes in interest rates 4 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 5 the supply of new and existing housing including foreclosures 6 various demographic factors 7 changes in federal income tax laws 8 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 9 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in the overall demand for new homes 

our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected increased revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements however the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration “fha” or veterans administration “va” mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

on december 1 2009 the environmental protection agency “epa” promulgated new regulations regarding effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for discharges from construction and development sites the new rule requires all construction sites subject to national pollutant discharge elimination system construction storm water permits issued by the epa or an authorized state to implement certain sediment and erosion controls and pollution prevention measures these rules also require sampling of storm water discharges and compliance with a numeric effluent 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

competition regulation and other factors continued 

  

limitation of 280 nephelometric turbidity units “ntus” beginning august 1 2011 for sites disturbing 20 or more acres at once and beginning february 2 2014 for sites disturbing 10 or more acres at once effective january 4 2011 the effluent limitation standard of 280 ntus has been stayed by the epa until it can complete a new rulemaking to correct the numeric limitation the epa currently plans to prepare a revision to the current numeric limit of 280 ntus in early 2011 and to take final action in may 2011 the numeric limit is the only portion of the new rule that has been stayed by the epa 

in addition to the new elg rules the epa also announced that it is committed to and has begun a rulemaking to address postconstruction storm water discharges from newly developed and redeveloped sites this rulemaking is expected to be completed by november 2012 there can be no assurance whether the epa will adopt final rules regarding postconstruction storm water discharges or if it does the form the final rules will take 

we are currently assessing the impact that the new elg rules and potential postconstruction rules will have on its business and results of operations 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma fhlmc and private investors we believe that our customers’ use of our inhouse mortgage and title operations provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing needs 

we utilize a centralized fulfillment center to perform our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions and also use centralized loan consultants we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency consistency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on providing attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers the majority of our customers now send us their data online to start the mortgage process once the completed online questionnaire is received an interview is scheduled and the combination of the interview with the data sent online represents our mortgage application 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements we subsequently sell such mortgage loans to outside investors substantially all of the loans we originate are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 we originated mortgage loans for 63 70 and 72 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years as the primary purpose for our mortgage operations is to support our homebuilding business our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 78 in 2010 while the capture rate was 85 in 2009 and 92 in 2008 

we sell our servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 to 120 days after sale 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of competitors provide online approval for their customers 

  

financial services operations continued 

  

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by many of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations are also subject to potential losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may result from borrower fraud borrower early payment defaults or loans that have not been underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines in the normal course of business our mortgage operations also provide limited indemnities for certain loans sold to investors historically losses related to these indemnities were not significant beginning in 2009 we experienced a significant increase in anticipated losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us the vast majority of these losses relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 when industry lending standards were less stringent and borrower fraud is believed to have peaked 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in select markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell we have only limited risk associated with our title operations due to the low incidence of claims related to underwriting risk associated with issued title insurance policies and fiduciary risk resulting from closing services 

financial information about geographic areas 

substantially all of our operations are located within the united states however we have some nonoperating foreign subsidiaries and affiliates which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

other nonoperating expenses 

other nonoperating expenses consist of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange accordingly these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2010 we employed 4363 people of which 630 people were employed in our financial services operations except for a small group of employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit or the company each business unit is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle which has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

prior to 2006 land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets however since early 2006 the homebuilding industry has been impacted by weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards a significant increase in the number of foreclosed homes and large supplies of resale and new home inventories which have contributed to an industrywide softening of demand for new homes as a result of these factors we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability we have also incurred substantial impairments of our land and certain other assets we cannot predict the duration or the severity of the current market conditions nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

as a result of the changing market conditions in the homebuilding industry that have occurred since early 2006 we incurred significant landrelated charges in each of the respective periods resulting from the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs related to land transactions we no longer plan to pursue net realizable valuation adjustments related to land positions sold or held for sale impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future and impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures it is possible that the estimated cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation adjustments additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for additional impairments or writedowns which could result in additional charges that might be significant 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers 

  

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria continued 

  

for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in the past we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank interest rates have been at historical lows for several years as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business beginning in early 2007 the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained as the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime alta and other nonconforming mortgage products our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ additionally these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

in addition the federal reserve has purchased a sizeable amount of mortgagebacked securities in part to stabilize mortgage interest rates and to support the market for mortgagebacked securities as the federal reserve reduces its holdings of mortgagebacked securities over time the availability and affordability of mortgage loans including the consumer interest rates for such loans could be adversely affected 

we also believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes the fha has and may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards raise minimum down payment requirements impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs andor limit the number of mortgages it insures the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

significant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes any changes to income tax laws by the federal government or a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions as has been considered from time to time would increase the aftertax cost of owning a home increases in real estate taxes by local governmental authorities also increase the cost of homeownership any such increases to the cost of homeownership could adversely impact the demand for and sales prices of new homes 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years in many cases the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers we need liquidity for future growth and development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results one source of liquidity is our unsecured revolving credit facility in the event the current challenging market conditions persist or we incur additional landrelated charges or other asset impairments we may violate certain financial covenants in the credit facility these violations if not waived by the lenders or cured could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility and could also result in a default under our 34 billion of senior notes 

the ability to reach an agreement with our lenders or to seek alternative sources of financing if necessary would depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the homebuilding industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreases further due to the market downturn at december 31 2010 we had cash and equivalents of 15 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

another source of liquidity includes our ability to use letters of credit and surety bonds pursuant to certain performancerelated obligations and as security for certain land option agreements and under various insurance programs the majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds are in support of our land development and construction obligations to various municipalities other government agencies and utility companies related to the construction of roads sewers and other infrastructure if we are unable to obtain letters of credit or performance bonds when required or the conditions imposed by issuers increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of location price reputation design community amenities and the quality of our homes we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials additionally the cost of certain building materials especially lumber steel and concrete is influenced by changes in global commodity prices increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sale contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain our evaluation is based on a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law 

  

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any continued 

  

correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our net income for such period 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are appropriately recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results however if the reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income executing tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences we have recorded valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowance will fluctuate as conditions change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income andor to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we have not experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 to preserve our ability to utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

as a result of the merger with centex our ability to use certain of centex’s preownership change nols bils or deductions is limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code the applicable section 382 limitation is approximately 68 million per year for nols losses realized on builtin loss assets that are sold within 60 months of the ownership change and certain deductions the limitation may result in a significant portion of centex’s preownership change nols bils and tax credit carryforwards or deductions not being available for our use 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets if the goodwill becomes impaired then our profits may be significantly reduced or eliminated and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets related to prior business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we also perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year if the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets is deemed impaired the carrying value is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our operating earnings we recorded goodwill impairments of 6563 million 5630 million and 57 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and have 2405 million and 1754 million of goodwill and intangible assets respectively remaining at december 31 2010 if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly additional impairments of either goodwill or intangible assets may occur 

  

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies these may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

we are subject to claims related to mortgage loans we sold in the secondary mortgage market that may be significant 

our mortgage operations have made certain representations and warranties related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary mortgage market that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan our mortgage operations may be and have been required to repurchase loans andor indemnify the investors that purchased the loans for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties in addition we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centex’s mortgage operations which originated its last loan in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor in loans originated by centex’s mortgage operations this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans 

the repurchase liability we recorded is estimated based on several factors including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands and the severity of loss upon repurchase while we believe that our current repurchase liability reserves are adequate the factors referred to above upon which we estimate our repurchase liability are subject to change in light of market developments the economic environment and other circumstances some of which are beyond our control accordingly there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty construction defect and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits through our

captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly additionally we are exposed to counterparty default risk related to our and our subcontractors’ insurance carriers we seek to manage such risk by maintaining our policies with highlyrated carriers 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the united states could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

on august 18 2009 we completed the acquisition of centex through the merger of pultegroup’s merger subsidiary with and into centex pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of april 7 2009 among pultegroup pi nevada building company and centex as a result of the merger centex became a whollyowned subsidiary of pultegroup accordingly the results of centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger 

since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures among other factors when combined with the significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment higher than normal unemployment levels and uncertainty in the us economy in recent periods these conditions have contributed to sharply weakened demand for new homes slower sales and heightened pricing pressures to attract homebuyers as a result we have experienced a pretax loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006 such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments since the beginning of 2006 we have incurred total landrelated charges of 55 billion and goodwill impairments of 16 billion 

the us housing market and broader economy remain in a period of uncertainty however we are beginning to see signs of stabilization in certain of our local markets though at near historically low levels this more stable environment resulted in a significant reduction in the level of landrelated charges recorded during 2010 compared with recent years we believe our strategic merger with centex positions us well for a recovery in the homebuilding industry however significant shortterm uncertainty remains the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit associated with the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 “the act” which was applicable to orders under contract by april 30 and closed by september 30 2010 favorably impacted our revenues for the first half of 2010 but also contributed to industrywide softness in new orders in the latter half of 2010 

entering 2011 there are indications that certain of the aforementioned negative trends may be slowing or improving however there are also a number of factors that may further worsen market conditions or delay a recovery in the homebuilding industry such factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term while we are purchasing select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so our targeted profile for such investments consists of developed lots frequently under rolling lot option contracts that are cash flow positive early in the project cycle and accretive to earnings we also continue to evaluate each existing land parcel to determine whether the strategy and economics support holding the 

  

overview continued 

  

parcel or disposing of it we have closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses since the beginning of the industry downturn and in conjunction with the centex merger due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus we are also adjusting the content in our homes to provide our customers more affordable alternatives including building homes with smaller floor plans in certain of our communities 

as a result of the centex merger we have achieved significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs and interest costs for the combined entity we have also achieved synergies in our purchasing leverage and integrating the combined organization’s operational best practices the centex merger has contributed to growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional brands we believe that the combination of our operational improvement activities with the benefits of the centex merger will help strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future 

while signs of improvement for the overall us economy employment and consumer confidence provide reasons for some level of optimism our outlook is tempered for 2011 as the timing of a sustainable recovery in the homebuilding industry remains uncertain if the negative trends in economic conditions or financial market volatility experienced in recent years return either nationally or to any of our local markets it could adversely affect our business and results of operations in future periods including a further reduction in the demand for housing as well as difficulties in accessing financing on acceptable terms given these conditions and the continued weakness in new home sales visibility as to future earnings performance is limited our evaluation for landrelated charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested if conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for further impairments or writedowns which could result in future charges that might be significant 

the following is a summary of our operating results for 2010 2009 and 2008 000’s omitted except per share data 

 

  

  

   

  

overview continued 

  

for additional information on each of the above see the applicable notes to the consolidated financial statements mergerrelated costs relates to transaction and integration costs directly related to the centex merger in total homebuilding incurred 1237 million of such costs in 2009 these costs consisted of 570 million of restructuring costs primarily severance and lease exit costs included in the above table within restructuring costs plus 666 million of investment banking and other professional fees amortization of certain fair value adjustments and certain other integration costs 

in addition to the above charges homebuilding continued to experience declining revenues after adjusting for the incremental revenue resulting from the centex merger and challenged gross margins 

 

  

  

  

  

 the above operating results for centex’s homebuilding operations included the aforementioned goodwill impairment charges of 5630 million and the majority of the mergerrelated transaction and integration costs

 as indicated above the centex merger had a significant impact on the operating results for 2010 and 2009 excluding the impact of the centex merger our revenues unit settlements and net new orders in both 2010 and 2009 would have experienced significant decreases from the respective prior year periods our reported home sale revenues unit settlements and net new orders for 2010 as reflected in the above tables represent decreases of 19 22 and 28 respectively from the combined operating results of the two companies from 2009 however these lower volumes were offset by lower landrelated charges improved gross margins and operating leverage and removal of the substantial majority of duplicative overhead costs from the combined companies excluding the impact of the goodwill impairments and insurancerelated losses recorded in 2010 and 2009 our homebuilding loss before income taxes in 2010 was significantly improved from the losses reported by either company or the combined companies in the prior year periods this illustrates the impact of the various actions we have taken to restructure our combined homebuilding operations into a more efficient organization as well as the more stable environment that we believe the homebuilding industry has entered 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

home sale revenues for 2010 which include 19 billion related to centex were higher than 2009 by 5505 million or 14 in 2009 home sale revenues which included 11 billion related to centex were lower than those for 2008 by 22 billion or 35 the increase in home sale revenues in 2010 over 2009 was mainly attributable to increased unit settlements of 14 as average selling price remained stable from 2009 to 2010 the decrease in home sale revenues in 2009 from 2008 was attributable to a decrease in unit settlements of 29 combined with a decrease in the average selling price of 9 the lower average selling price in 2010 and 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from a combination of pricing pressures due to challenging industry conditions and a shift in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the periods including an increased concentration in the firsttime buyer segment resulting from the centex merger along with adjusting the product offering in certain communities to better align with current market conditions 

homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2010 were 94 compared with negative 105 in 2009 and negative 101 in 2008 the improvement in our gross margin is largely due to the significant decrease in land and community valuation adjustments to 1697 million in 2010 compared with 7512 million in 2009 and 12 billion in 2008 gross profit margins were also adversely impacted in 2009 by the fair value adjustment related to homes under construction inventory acquired with the centex merger we recognized this fair value adjustment as an increase of 311 million to home cost of revenues as the related homes closed home sale gross profit margins excluding land and community valuation adjustments amortization of capitalized interest and mergerrelated costs were 167 in 2010 compared to 123 in 2009 and 122 in 2008 the increase in gross margin reflects a combination of factors including shifts in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the year better alignment of our product offering with current market conditions and our various initiatives to reduce the construction cost of our homes see the nongaap financial measure section for reconciliation of home sale gross profit margins excluding land and community valuation adjustments amortization of capitalized interest and mergerrelated costs to home sale gross profit margins 

we continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital land sale revenues and their related gains or losses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of land sales land sales had a negative margin contribution of 257 million for 2010 and negative margin contributions of 1139 million and 2622 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively these margin contributions in 2010 2009 and 2008 included net realizable value adjustments totaling 391 million 1137 million and 2711 million respectively related to land held for sale 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sale revenues were 194 in 2010 compared with 163 in 2009 and 130 in 2008 this increase was largely the result of 2804 million in insurancerelated charges taken during 2010 substantially all of which related to general liability construction defect claims inclusive of this charge insurancerelated expenses totaled 3136 million 349 million and 1035 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively excluding the charge recorded in 2010 insurancerelated expenses decreased in 2010 and 2009 from 2008 primarily as the result of lower revenues we also experienced some adverse development in our projected general liability claims during 2008 that contributed to that year’s expense excluding such charges our selling general and administrative expense both in dollars and as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased significantly from 2009 homebuilding selling general and administrative expense also included severance costs of 223 million in 2010 during 2009 homebuilding selling general and administrative expense included transaction and integration costs related to the centex merger including employee severance costs totaling 650 million as well as certain duplicative corporate and divisional overhead costs during the transition period following the merger employee severance costs recorded to homebuilding selling general and administrative expense during 2008 totaled 281 million overall we have achieved significant reductions in overhead costs since the centex merger however our overhead leverage remains high relative to our sales volumes so achieving a more efficient overhead structure remains an area of focus in order to further reduce overhead cost and drive greater leverage we reconfigured our organization during the fourth quarter of 2010 reducing the number of operating areas from six to four and consolidating certain divisions along with these changes in our field operations we also further reduced corporate and support staffing across a number of functions to further consolidate and streamline our operating processes we expect that these changes in our operating structure along with the completion of our integration activities related to the centex merger will significantly reduce our selling general and administrative costs in 2011 

equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities was 28 million 497 million and 129 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the primary cause for this change in results is the lower levels of impairments related to these entities in 2010 and 2008 compared with 2009 the majority of our unconsolidated entities represent land development joint ventures so the timing of income and losses can vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of transactions and circumstances specific to each entity

other income expense net includes the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions which totaled 56 million 543 million and 333 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these writeoffs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital other income expense net also includes lease exit costs and asset impairments related to overhead reduction efforts totaling 284 million in 2010 and 133 million in 2008 in 2009 other income expense included certain integration costs including lease exit costs directly related to the centex merger totaling 275 million 

other income expense net also includes goodwill impairment charges of 6563 million 5630 million and 50 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these impairments 

for 2010 net new orders increased 7 to 15148 units compared with 14185 units in 2009 the increase in net new order units was primarily attributable to the positive impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit in the first half of 2010 and incremental orders resulting from the centex merger partially offset in the latter half of 2010 by a lower average sales pace per community for 2009 net new order units decreased 7 to 14185 units compared with 15306 units in 2008 excluding centex net new order units decreased moderately during 2010 and significantly during 2009 due to the uncertainty in the overall us housing industry most markets continue to have significant resale and new home inventory on the market and this combined with low consumer confidence difficulties experienced by customers in selling their existing homes the high rate of foreclosures and the tighter mortgage financing market has resulted in reduced net new orders cancellation rates were 19 in 2010 23 in 2009 and 33 in 2008 as the cancellation rate for 2010 reverted back to our more typical historical range compared with the heightened cancellation rates experienced during 2006 through 2008 

the dollar value of net new orders increased 1908 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased 3930 million in 2009 compared to 2008 at december 31 2010 we had 786 active selling communities a decrease of 11 from december 31 2009 at december 31 2009 we had 882 active selling communities an increase of 54 from december 31 2008 centex contributed 435 active communities at december 31 2009 ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 3964 units at december 31 2010 with a dollar value of 11 billion compared with ending backlog of 5931 units at december 31 2009 with a dollar value of 16 billion 

we had 6284 and 6653 homes in production at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively excluding 1452 and 1657 model homes respectively included in our total homes in production were 3494 and 2793 homes that were unsold to customers at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively of which 1856 and 1309 homes respectively were completed 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 our homebuilding operations controlled 147194 and 154694 lots respectively of these controlled lots 131964 and 138273 lots were owned and 10082 and 14208 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively in addition there were 5148 and 2213 lots under option agreements pending approval at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively while we are purchasing select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so the reduction in lots resulting from unit settlements land disposition activity and withdrawals from land option contracts exceeded the number of lots added by new transactions during the year ended december 31 2010 

the total purchase price related to land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated 7095 million at december 31 2010 these land option agreements which may be cancelled at our discretion and may extend over several years are secured by deposits and preacquisition costs totaling 951 million of which only 31 million is refundable this balance excludes contingent payment obligations which may or may not become actual obligations to us 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information about our home sale gross profit margins excluding land and community valuation adjustments amortization of capitalized interest and mergerrelated costs which is considered a nongaap financial measure under the sec’s rules and should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for home sale gross margin which we define as home sale revenues less home cost of revenues as a measure of our operating performance management and our local divisions use this measure in evaluating the operating performance of each 

  

nongaap financial measures continued 

  

community and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing construction and development pace product mix and other daily operating decisions we believe it is a relevant and useful measure to investors for evaluating our performance through gross profit generated on homes delivered during a given period and for comparing our operating performance to other companies in the homebuilding industry although other companies in the homebuilding industry report similar information the methods used may differ we urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies in the homebuilding industry to calculate gross margins and any adjustments thereto before comparing our measures to that of such other companies

west

west home sale revenues decreased 35 in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to a 32 decrease in unit settlements and a 5 decrease in average selling price as the majority of our west markets experienced lower home sale revenues excluding centex home sale revenues and settlements decreased significantly and average selling price decreased moderately compared with 2008 during 2009 the reduction in revenues was partially offset by higher gross margins in several of our markets which also included 1900 million in landrelated charges and a 12 million valuation adjustment related to unconsolidated joint ventures the decreased loss before income taxes in 2009 was primarily due to significantly lower landrelated charges and lower impairments in unconsolidated joint ventures which totaled 4642 million and 154 million respectively in 2008 excluding landrelated charges we experienced increased gross margins in each of our west markets with the exception of the bay area net new orders decreased by 11 in 2009 compared with 2008 cancellation rates were 25 in 2009 compared with 41 in 2008 

  

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which include mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries we originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors also we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

 

 operating as a captive business model primarily targeted to supporting our homebuilding operations the operating results of our financial services operations are directly linked to homebuilding since 2007 the mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from subprime alta and high loantovalue loans brought about by investors’ reluctance to purchase these loans due to their perceived risk this among other things has resulted in an overall tightening of lending standards and a shift toward agency production and fixed rate loans versus adjustable rate mortgages “arms” 

our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production representing 98 of loan originations for 2010 98 for 2009 and 99 for 2008 total financial services revenues during 2010 increased 3 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of increased home settlement volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 financial services revenues for 2009 decreased 22 compared with 2008 primarily as a result of lower loan origination volume due to lower home settlements within our homebuilding operations interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was moderately lower in 2010 than in 2009 due to the combination of lower interest rates and selling loans faster in 2010 and significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008 due to the decrease in loan origination volume revenues from our title operations increased 9 in 2010 compared with 2009 due to increased home settlement volume and increased 59 in 2009 compared with 2008 due to the centex merger 

agency production for funded origination principal was 99 99 and 98 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively within the funded agency origination principal fha loans were approximately 38 40 and 25 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our capture rate for 2010 was 78 compared with 85 for 2009 and 92 for 2008 our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash settlements our customers’ average fico scores for 2010 2009 and 2008 were 749 743 and 739 respectively at december 31 2010 our loan application backlog was 5588 million compared with 8779 million at december 31 2009 

substantially all loan production in 2010 2009 and 2008 consisted of fixed rate loans the majority of which are prime conforming loans we define prime loans as full documentation first mortgages with fico scores of 621 or higher alta loans as nonfull documentation first mortgages with fico scores of 621 or higher and subprime loans as first mortgages with fico scores of 620 or lower the shift toward agency fixedrate loans from arms and interestonly mortgages a component of arms has contributed to profitability as fixed rate loans generally result in higher profitability due to higher servicing values less competition and structured guidelines that allow for expense efficiencies when processing the loan 

income before income taxes increased significantly in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower expenses related to loan repurchase liabilities combined with improved operating efficiencies income before income taxes decreased significantly in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to increased loan loss reserves decreased loan 

  

financial services operations continued 

  

origination volumes and lower values of servicing rights the 2009 loss before income taxes also includes certain integration costs directly related to the centex merger totaling 84 million which consist primarily of severance benefits and lease exit and related asset impairment costs financial services also incurred goodwill impairment charges of 07 million in 2008 but none in either 2009 or 2010 

since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate our overall loan losses have historically not been significant in 2010 and 2009 however we experienced higher than historical losses on our loans held for investment repurchased or reinsured loans and foreclosed properties the largest source of these losses has been a significant increase in anticipated losses for loans previously originated and sold to investors such losses may result from certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan if determined to be at fault we either repurchase the loans from the investors or reimburse the investors’ losses we establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon among other things the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands and the severity of loss upon repurchase beginning in 2009 we have experienced a significant increase in anticipated losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us additionally centex’s mortgage operations were historically broader than those of pulte mortgage so our exposure to losses related to loans previously originated increased significantly as a result of the centex merger while not increasing our exposure to centex’s contingent loan origination liabilities we entered into an agreement in conjunction with the wind down of centex’s mortgage operations which originated its last loan in december 2009 that provides a guaranty for one major investor in loans originated by centex’s mortgage operations this guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of centex’s mortgage operations related to breaches of representations and warranties in the origination of a certain pool of loans other than with respect to this pool of loans our contractual repurchase obligations are limited to our nonguarantor subsidiaries see note 17 for a discussion of nonguarantor subsidiaries 

the vast majority of losses related to our overall exposure for loans previously originated and sold to investors relate to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 when industry lending standards were less stringent and borrower fraud is believed to have peaked given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims it is reasonably possible that future losses may exceed our current estimates changes in these liabilities are as follows 000’s omitted 

 

 in addition to the above loan loss provisions related to our portfolio loans real estate owned and mortgage reinsurance reserves totaled 12 million 98 million and 170 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we are exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and cancelled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment these financial instruments can include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury futures contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments the changes in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment and the other derivative financial instruments are included in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

other nonoperating 

other nonoperating expenses consist of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange accordingly these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve the following table presents a summary of other nonoperating expenses 000’s omitted 

 

 the slight decrease in net interest income in 2010 compared with 2009 resulted from higher invested cash balances and a corporate note receivable offset by lower interest rates the decrease in net interest income in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from significantly lower interest rates on our invested cash balances the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses for 2010 compared with 2009 is due primarily to the prior year period containing certain integration costs directly related to the centex merger totaling 54 million other income expense net consists of gains losses on debt retirements see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

we capitalize interest cost into inventory during the active development and construction of our communities each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements interest expensed to homebuilding cost of revenues for 2010 2009 and 2008 includes 276 million 682 million and 848 million respectively of capitalized interest related to inventory impairments during the second and third quarters of 2010 the level of our active inventory was lower than our debt level accordingly 15 million of homebuilding interest costs were expensed directly to interest expense in 2010 during 2009 and 2008 we capitalized all of our homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the level of our active inventory exceeded our debt levels given the substantial reduction in debt that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2010 our active inventory exceeded our debt levels at december 31 2010 while the amount of interest incurred and capitalized into homebuilding inventory will decline as the result of these debt retirements the amount of interest expensed will actually increase in the near term due to the amortization of previously capitalized amounts 

information related to interest capitalized into inventory is as follows 000’s omitted 

 

  homebuilding interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt shortterm borrowings and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our financial services segment and certain other interest costs 

income taxes 

our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors the most significant of which is the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits due to the effect of our valuation allowance and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits our effective tax rates for 2008 through 2010 are not meaningful as our income tax benefit is not correlated to the amount of our pretax loss our effective tax rates were a benefit of 112 for 2010 compared with a benefit of 401 and 124 for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

income taxes continued 

  

the income tax benefit for 2010 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters our 2009 income tax benefit of 7926 million was primarily due to the impact of the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 the “act” which was enacted into law on november 6 2009 the act amended section 172 of the internal revenue code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years previously limited to two years the act allowed us to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes we recorded income taxes receivable of 8673 million at december 31 2009 related to the carryback of net operating losses pursuant to the act 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisitions development and construction activities by using internallygenerated funds and existing credit arrangements we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources including securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations or if we incur additional landrelated charges 

at december 31 2010 we had cash and equivalents of 15 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” we also had 34 billion of senior notes outstanding other financing included limited recourse landcollateralized financing totaling 06 million sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents our credit facility and our unsecured letter of credit facility the “loc agreement” an additional source of liquidity during 2010 was the receipt of federal tax refunds aggregating 9347 million such refunds resulted primarily from the carryback of taxable losses provided by the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 

we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm investments generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities we monitor our investments with each bank on a daily basis and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however given the volatility in the global financial markets there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding our landcollateralized debt was 614 at december 31 2010 and 474 net of cash and equivalents 

in june 2009 we entered into the loc agreement a fiveyear unsecured letter of credit facility that permits the issuance of up to 2000 million of letters of credit the loc agreement supplements our existing letter of credit capacity included in our credit facility described below at december 31 2010 1672 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the loc agreement 

given the difficult conditions in the homebuilding industry in recent years we have reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit facility as the result of a combination of reduced working capital needs and challenges in meeting the credit facility’s financial covenants on december 23 2010 we entered into the fifth amendment to third amended and restated credit agreement the “fifth amendment” which decreased the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from 7500 million to 2500 million and also reduced the required level of cash and equivalents to be maintained in certain liquidity reserve accounts previously on december 11 2009 we entered into the fourth amendment and waiver to third amended and restated credit agreement which reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from 12 billion to 7500 million replaced the maximum debt to capitalization ratio with a maximum debt to tangible capital limit reduced the tangible net worth minimum and waived any default under the previous credit facility resulting from failure to comply with the tangible net worth financial covenant 

under the terms of the credit facility we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to 2500 million borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding the credit facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

fitch ratings moody’s investor service and standard and poor’s corporation the “rating agencies” we currently do not have investment grade ratings from any of the rating agencies and are therefore subject to the borrowing base limitation given the uncertainty of current market conditions we anticipate operating under the borrowing base limitation for the remainder of the credit facility’s term under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the credit facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets at december 31 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining 284 million under the credit facility after consideration of 2216 million of outstanding letters of credit as a result the borrowing base limitation did not restrict our borrowing availability at december 31 2010 

we are also required to maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test specifically if the interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility is less than 20 to 10 we are required to maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks while our access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted failure to maintain sufficient balances within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts our ability to utilize the credit facility we maintained the required cash and equivalents of 2500 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at december 31 2010 calculated under the credit facility as two times the amount by which the interest incurred over the last four quarters exceeds interest income over the last four quarters excluding financial services with a maximum amount of 2500 million to be maintained in the liquidity reserve accounts effective with the fifth amendment additionally failure to satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to libor margin and letter of credit pricing our interest coverage ratio for the quarter ended december 31 2010 was negative 066 for the period ending march 31 2011 we will be required to maintain cash and equivalents of 2500 million within the liquidity reserve accounts 

the credit facility contains certain financial covenants we are required to not exceed a debt to tangible capital ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth covenant each quarter at december 31 2010 our debt to tangible capital ratio as defined in the credit facility was 575 compared with the requirement not to exceed 600 while our tangible net worth as defined in the credit facility cushion was 4362 million accordingly we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility as of december 31 2010 however the required debt to tangible capital ratio adjusts to 575 as of both march 31 and june 30 2011 and 550 as of the end of each quarter thereafter in the event we are not able to reduce our debt to tangible capital ratio below our current level our compliance with the required covenant levels may be adversely impacted violations of the financial covenants in the credit facility if not waived by the lenders or cured could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in the event these violations were not waived by the lenders or cured the violations could also result in a default under our 34 billion of senior notes based on current market conditions we believe that we may need to take action in order to avoid violating the debt to tangible capital ratio potentially as early as march 31 2011 possible actions could include negotiating changes to the credit facility’s financial covenants with our group of lenders or arranging a new credit facility terminating the credit facility which would release the funds currently maintained in the liquidity reserve accounts 2500 million and using our available cash to collateralize required letters of credit 2216 million at december 31 2010 or replacing the credit facility with a separate letter of credit facility similar to our existing loc agreement while there can be no assurances that we could complete any of these actions given the uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and the financial markets we believe that the combination of these potential actions will allow us to avoid any violations of covenants under either the credit facility or senior notes for the near term 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to certain third party and intercompany borrowings pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors generally within 30 days at december 31 2009 pulte mortgage had a combination of repurchase lending agreements in place with various banks that provided borrowing capacity totaling 1750 million given our strong liquidity and the cost of third party financing relative to existing mortgage rates pulte mortgage allowed each of its third party borrowing arrangements to expire during 2010 and began funding its operations using internal company resources at december 31 2010 we elected to fund 745 million of pulte mortgage’s financing needs via a repurchase agreement with the company in order to satisfy regulatory requirements in certain states pulte mortgage also maintains a 25 million repurchase lending agreement with a bank that expires in october 2011 there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of december 31 2010 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

pursuant to the two 100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october 2002 and 2005 and the 200 million stock repurchase authorization in february 2006 for a total stock repurchase authorization of 400 million we have repurchased a total of 9688900 shares for a total of 2977 million there have been no repurchases under these programs since 2006 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 1023 million at december 31 2010 

for the last three years we have generated significant positive cash flow primarily through the liquidation of land inventory without a corresponding level of reinvestment combined with refunds of income taxes paid in prior years we have used this positive cash flow to among other things increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt over the last three years we have retired 31 billion of debt including debt assumed with the centex merger see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding these retirements the majority of this debt was retired prior to its stated maturity in the fourth quarter of 2010 we retired 8985 million of senior notes additionally we voluntarily used 1112 million to repurchase at a discount prior to their maturity certain community development district obligations with an aggregate principal balance of 1241 million in order to improve the future financial performance of the related communities see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and also voluntarily used 745 million of company funds to finance pulte mortgage’s lending operations rather than continue to use third party financing arrangements however we do not anticipate that we will be able to continue to generate positive cash flow at these same levels in the near future additionally should growth conditions return to the homebuilding industry we will need to invest significant capital into our operations to support such growth 

our net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 5803 million in 2010 7389 million in 2009 and 12 billion in 2008 during 2010 we received federal income tax refunds of 9347 million compared with 3620 million and 2121 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively after adjusting for these tax refunds operating cash flow was negative for 2010 generally the primary drivers of cash flow from operations are inventory levels and profitability for the years ended 2008 through 2010 our net losses were largely attributable to noncash asset impairments including landrelated charges and goodwill impairments cash flows from operations in 2010 were negatively impacted by the voluntary repurchase of certain community development district obligations for 1112 million see above and using 745 million to internally finance pulte mortgage’s lending operations during 2010 inventory levels and residential mortgage loans availableforsale decreased slightly while operating cash flows in 2009 and 2008 benefited from a significant net decrease in inventory and residential mortgage loans availableforsale  

net cash used by investing activities was 195 million at december 31 2010 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 17 billion in 2009 and net cash used in investing activities of 559 million in 2008 the net cash used in 2010 was primarily the result of investments in unconsolidated entities and capital expenditures partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated entities and a reduction in residential mortgage loans held for investment our contributions to unconsolidated entities and investments in capital expenditures have declined in recent years as the result of the reduction in our overall land investments substantially all of the cash provided by investing activities in 2009 was the result of cash acquired through the centex merger for 2008 the majority of the cash used by investing activities related to contributions to our unconsolidated entities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 9484 million 22 billion and 5677 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively net cash used in 2010 was primarily the result of the repurchase of senior notes as mentioned above as well as repayments made under financial services credit arrangements the large increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2009 was largely attributable to 20 billion used to retire outstanding debt combined with reductions in amounts outstanding under our financial services credit arrangements net cash used in 2008 was largely attributable to the repurchase of outstanding senior notes combined with reductions in amounts outstanding under our financial services credit arrangements 

on november 24 2008 our board of directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on our common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

inflation continued 

  

homebuyers while we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in substantially all of our markets if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly affecting our prospective homebuyers’ willingness or ability to adequately finance home purchases our revenues gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 

seasonality 

we experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry historically we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements however the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

  

  

  

 we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them this reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2010 we had agreements to acquire 15230 homesites through option contracts at december 31 2010 we had 920 million of nonrefundable option deposits and preacquisition costs related to these agreements 

at december 31 2010 we had 2580 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 484 million of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 19982010 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2010 

 

  

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and performance and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2010 we had outstanding letters of credit of 3889 million performance bonds and surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 13 billion at december 31 2010 are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years we do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance or surety bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2010 these agreements totaled approximately 7095 million pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices in certain instances we are required to record the land under option as if we own it at december 31 2010 we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of 508 million as land not owned under option agreements 

at december 31 2010 aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 155 million of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was 51 million of our proportionate share of joint venture debt we provided limited recourse guaranties for 14 million of such joint venture debt at december 31 2010 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for 2010 2009 and 2008 we recognized equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities of 29 million 497 million and 128 respectively the earnings losses in 2010 2009 and 2008 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 19 million 541 million and 185 million respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by asc 36020 “property plant and equipment  real estate sales” the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred expected gains and losses from the sale of residential mortgage loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through financial services at the time of commitment subsequent changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in financial services revenues as they occur interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory valuation 

inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value as determined in accordance with asc 36010 “property plant and equipment – impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “asc 36010” accumulated cost

inventory valuation continued 

  

includes costs associated with land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements 

cost of revenues includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

in accordance with asc 36010 we record valuation adjustments on land inventory when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of market comparable transactions where available and discounted cash flow models these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

investments in unconsolidated entities 

we have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities including joint ventures with independent third parties many of these unconsolidated entities purchase develop andor sell land and homes in the united states and puerto rico the equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20 and not more than 50 under the equity method of accounting we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities certain of these entities sell land to us in these situations we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold the cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20 ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with asc 323 “investments – equity method and joint ventures” if we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary we write down the investment to its estimated fair value any such losses are recorded to equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statements of operations additionally each unconsolidated entity evaluates its longlived assets such as inventory for recoverability in accordance with asc 36010 our proportionate share of any such impairments under asc 36010 are also recorded to equity in earnings

investments in unconsolidated entities continued 

  

loss of unconsolidated entities in the consolidated statements of operations evaluations of recoverability under both asc 323 and asc 36010 are primarily based on projected cash flows due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans 

in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we use the fair value option for our residential mortgage loans availableforsale asc 825 permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contractbycontract basis election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loans held for investment consist of a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing these loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful 

mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations have established liabilities for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may result from certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan we establish liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon among other things the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by investors our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase demands and the severity of loss upon repurchase 

from time to time our mortgage operations will be required to repurchase certain loans we originated and sold to third parties if a repurchased loan is performing it is classified as a residential mortgage loan availableforsale and recorded at fair value such repurchased loans are typically resold to third party investors if a repurchased loan is nonperforming the loan is classified as loans held for investment we establish an allowance for such loans based on our historical loss experience and current loss trends 

although we consider our mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities to be adequate there can be no assurance that these allowances and liabilities will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations these allowances and liabilities may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy the mortgage market or discrete events adversely affecting specific borrowers 

goodwill 

we recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to the centex merger completed in 2009 goodwill which represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable in the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded a goodwill impairment of 5630 million as part of our annual goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test in 2010 we performed an eventdriven assessment as of september 30 2010 in light of certain unfavorable indicators 

we test goodwill at the reporting unit level which represents an operating segment or one level below because goodwill is assigned at the reporting unit level after an acquisition and reflects the current overall operating structure of the business it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition we allocated goodwill resulting from the centex merger to 24 reporting units of which 23 reporting units related to our homebuilding reporting segments and one reporting unit related to our financial services reporting segment as a result of the impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2009 and impairment tests in 2010 we have recorded cumulative impairments of the goodwill acquired with the centex merger totaling 12 billion as a result our remaining goodwill totals 2405 million at december 31 2010 allocated amongst 13 of our homebuilding reporting units goodwill for the other 11 reporting units included in the original allocation of goodwill has been writtenoff due to either impairment or disposal 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

goodwill continued 

  

we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by following a two step process step one of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation methods including the use of discounted cash flows supplemented by marketbased assessments of fair value the fair values are significantly impacted by estimates related to current market valuations current and future economic conditions in each of our geographical markets including the demand for new housing and our strategic plans within each of our geographical markets the discounted cash flow valuations involve the use of certain key assumptions including projected revenue growth profitability and working capital levels as well as marketbased discount rates a discount rate of 100 was used for all reporting units in the 2010 and 2009 goodwill impairment tests based on a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital for the homebuilding industry in performing these valuations we rely on our internal forecasts trended toward longterm averages that vary by reporting unit based on a combination of historical performance and our expectations for the future due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing actual results could differ significantly from such estimates as a result of step one of the september 2010 goodwill impairment test we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for the majority of our reporting units with goodwill we perform step two of the goodwill impairment test for any reporting unit whose carrying value exceeds its fair value step two involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities with the excess representing implied goodwill an impairment loss is recognized if the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill as a result of step 2 at both september 30 2010 and october 31 2009 we determined that a significant portion of our goodwill balance was impaired we also performed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill as of october 31 2010 which determined that no additional impairments existed 

the below table summarizes our 2010 goodwill impairment test results 000’s omitted 

 

 as reflected in the above table 2280 million of the goodwill remaining at december 31 2010 the sum of lines a and b relates to goodwill allocated to 11 reporting units that are at increased risk of future impairment our overall outlook and cash flow projections for each reporting unit involve the use of certain key assumptions many of which are interdependent upon each other a change in any one or combination of these assumptions could impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or other economic conditions deteriorate goodwill may be further impaired also while not directly triggering an impairment of goodwill a significant decrease in our market capitalization in the future may indicate that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units has decreased should subsequent analysis confirm that a decrease has occurred for one or more reporting units an impairment of goodwill may result a hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of each reporting unit would have resulted in an additional impairment loss of approximately 1599 million related to the 11 reporting units with goodwill balances remaining at december 31 2010

the below table summarizes the goodwill at increased risk of future impairment by reportable segment as of december 31 2010 000’s omitted 

 

 we will continue to monitor each of our reporting units and perform goodwill impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable see note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our goodwill impairment 

intangible assets 

we have recorded intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the centex merger completed in 2009 and the del webb merger completed in 2001 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives the carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists if the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of such intangible assets changes the related intangible assets may be impaired 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

selfinsured risks 

we maintain and require the majority of our subcontractors to maintain general liability insurance coverage including coverage for certain construction defects we also maintain property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance coverage these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims however we retain a significant portion of the overall risk for such claims either through policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiaries or through our own selfinsured per occurrence and aggregate retentions deductibles and available policy limits the availability of general liability insurance for the homebuilding industry and its subcontractors has become increasingly limited and more expensive in recent years in certain instances we may offer our subcontractors the opportunity to purchase insurance through one of our captive insurance subsidiaries or to participate in a project specific insurance program provided by us any policy issued by the captive insurance subsidiaries represents selfinsurance of these risks by us while general liability coverage for the homebuilding industry is complex and our coverage varies significantly based on the policy year in recent years we have generally been selfinsured for 50 million to 75 million on a per occurrence basis and up to 600 million on an annual aggregate basis at which point our excess or reinsurance coverage begins 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

selfinsured risks continued 

  

we generally reserve for costs associated with insurance claims and their related lawsuits including expected legal fees based on an actuarial analysis of our historical claims the actuarial analysis includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported these estimates make up a significant portion of our estimates and are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including changes in claims reporting and resolution patterns third party recoveries insurance industry practices the regulatory environment and legal precedent state regulations vary but construction defect claims are reported and resolved over an extended period often exceeding ten years as a result actual costs could differ significantly from estimated costs 

adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs our recorded reserves for all insurance claims totaled 8138 million and 5667 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively substantially all of which relates to general liability insurance the increase in the liability at december 31 2010 was due to recording additional expense to insurance reserves during 2010 as a result of experiencing greater than anticipated frequency of newly reported claims and an increase in specific case reserves related to known claims for homes closed in prior periods substantially all of these increases related to general liability reserves the recorded reserves included an actuarial assessment of incurred but not reported claims which represented approximately 76 and 75 of the total general liability reserves at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively changes in the number and timing of reported claims and the estimates of specific claim values will significantly impact estimates of future reserves which are reflected by the incurred but not reported reserve 

in certain instances we have the ability to recover a portion of its costs under various insurance policies or from our subcontractors or other third parties estimates of such amounts are recorded when recovery is considered probable the actuarial analyses of the reserves also consider historical third party recovery rates our insurance policies are maintained with highlyrated underwriters for whom we believe counterparty default risk is not significant 

stockbased compensation 

we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited 

income taxes 

we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses forecasts of future profitability the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration and tax planning alternatives the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

we follow the provisions of asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements asc 740 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and disclosure significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and settlements of audit issues

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financing to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2010 and 2009 our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value 000’s omitted 

 

 pulte mortgage operating as a mortgage banker is also subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreedupon terms ie commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2010 and 2009 this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

we minimize interest rate risk by hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of plus 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results 

at december 31 2010 our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining nonoperating investments in mexico which approximated 02 million

 management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed 

management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation additionally because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

in order to ensure that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of december 31 2010 management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management asserts that the company has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010

 the board of directors and shareholders of pultegroup inc 

we have audited pultegroup inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria pultegroup inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion pultegroup inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of pultegroup inc as of december 31 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 and our report dated february 10 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item i business 

pulte homes inc 

pulte homes inc “pulte” or the “company” is a publiclyheld holding company whose subsidiaries engage in the homebuilding and financial services businesses pulte homes inc is a michigan corporation organized in 1956 our assets consist principally of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries our direct subsidiaries include pulte diversified companies inc del webb corporation “del webb” centex corporation “centex” and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business pulte diversified companies inc’s operating subsidiaries include pulte home corporation pulte international corporation “international” and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business we also have mortgage banking operations conducted principally through pulte mortgage llc “pulte mortgage” and title operations 

on august 18 2009 the company completed the acquisition of centex through the merger of pulte’s merger subsidiary with and into centex pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of april 7 2009 among pulte pi nevada building company and centex as a result of the merger centex became a whollyowned subsidiary of pulte accordingly the results of centex are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger 

since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by a lack of consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures these factors have contributed to weakened demand for new homes slower sales and increased price discounts and sales incentives to attract homebuyers during 2009 these conditions were accompanied by significant foreclosure activity a more challenging appraisal environment increasing unemployment and significant uncertainty in the us economy as a result of the combination of these homebuilding industry mortgage financing and broader economic factors we have experienced a net loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006 such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments 

homebuilding our core business is engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the continental united states and the construction of housing on such land targeted for firsttime first and second moveup and active adult home buyers in the third quarter of 2009 in connection with the centex merger we realigned the organizational structure for certain of our markets as a result our reportable homebuilding segments are as follows 

 

  our homebuilding operations located in reno nevada are reported in the west segment while our remaining nevada homebuilding operations are reported in the southwest segment also our hawaii and puerto rico operations are included in other homebuilding which does not represent a reportable segment

homebuilding operations 

 

 through our brands which include pulte homes del webb centex fox  jacobs and divosta we offer a wide variety of home designs including singlefamily detached townhouses condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to all of our major customer segments firsttime first and second moveup and active adult over our 60year history we have delivered over 550000 homes 

as of december 31 2009 our homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 882 communities sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 88 of our communities fall within the range of 100000 to 400000 with a 2009 average unit selling price of 258000 compared with 284000 in 2008 322000 in 2007 337000 in 2006 and 315000 in 2005 sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 77 in 2009 compared with 75 in 2008 74 in both 2007 and 2006 and 72 in 2005 the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses condominiums and duplexes as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for firsttime and active adult homebuyers our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result help to insulate us from demand changes in individual markets since 2006 however such diversification has not insulated us from demand changes due to the nationwide downturn in the homebuilding industry that has had a significant adverse impact on our operations in each of our markets as of december 31 2009 our homebuilding business operated in 69 markets spanning 29 states 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 16 billion 5931 units at december 31 2009 and 6310 million 2174 units at december 31 2008 for each order in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and the required customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2009 substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2010 though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by or final negotiations with the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose not to retain the deposit in certain instances

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers though we periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development additionally we may determine that certain of our land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of option contracts we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other large projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period as a result land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2009 we controlled 154694 lots of which 138273 were owned and 16421 were under option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer groups segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group 

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features in certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which most features shown in the home are included in the sales price 

typically our sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the construction field manager 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features in the case of firsttime buyers in the low to moderate price range financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our financial services operations we also enjoy sales to the moveup buyer in higher price ranges

construction 

the construction process for our homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction field managers the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we continue to shift toward component offsite manufacturing methods to provide high efficiency high quality and lower cost products to our customers we believe that our trades are an extension of our production system and jointly focus on lean construction techniques to bring the highest value possible to our customers while setting the standard in trade relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the house construction process 

we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain of our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives 

we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future while the availability of materials and labor is not a significant concern under current market conditions we have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets in previous years

competition regulation and other factors 

our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is fragmented and highly competitive in each of our local markets there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with the resales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units for sale or to rent including apartment operators may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in the costs of building materials and labor 3 changes in interest rates 4 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 5 various demographic factors 6 changes in federal income tax laws 7 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 8 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in the overall demand for new homes 

our homebuilding operating cycle historically reflected escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth quarters however the challenging market conditions experienced in recent years have lessened the seasonal variations of our results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration “fha” or veterans administration “va” mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

on december 1 2009 the environmental protection agency “epa” promulgated new regulations regarding effluent limitation guidelines “elg” for discharges from construction and development sites the new rule requires all construction sites subject to national pollutant discharge elimination system construction storm water permits issued by epa or an authorized state to implement certain sediment and erosion controls and pollution prevention measures these rules also require sampling of storm water discharges and compliance with a numeric effluent limitation of 280 nephelometric turbidity units beginning august 1 2011 for sites disturbing 20 or more acres at once and beginning february 2 2014 for sites disturbing 10 or more acres at once 

in addition to the new elg rules epa also announced that it is committed to and has begun a rulemaking to address postconstruction storm water discharges from newly developed and redeveloped sites this rulemaking is expected to be completed by november 2012 there can be no assurance whether epa will adopt final rules regarding postconstruction storm water discharges or if it does the form the final rule will take 

the company is currently assessing the impact that the new elg rules and potential postconstruction rules will have on its business and results of operations 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma fhlmc and private investors 

  

financial services operations continued 

  

we utilize a centralized fulfillment center to perform our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions and also use centralized loan consultants we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed efficiency consistency and quality of our mortgage operations improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers in 2009 we had a high level of utilization of our online customer questionnaire the majority of our customers now send us their data online to start the mortgage process once the questionnaire is received an interview is scheduled and the combination of the interview with the data sent online represents our mortgage application 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements we subsequently sell such mortgage loans to outside investors substantially all of the loans originated by the company are sold in the secondary market within a short period of time after origination 

during 2009 2008 and 2007 we originated mortgage loans for 70 72 and 76 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years our capture rate which we define as loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements was 85 in 2009 while the capture rates for both 2008 and 2007 were 92 

we sell our servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 to 120 days after sale 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our mortgage operations are also subject to potential losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may result from borrower fraud certain borrower early payment defaults or loans that have not been underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines in the normal course of business our mortgage operations also provide limited indemnities for certain loans sold to investors during 2009 our mortgage operations have experienced a significant increase in actual and anticipated losses as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to us 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in selected markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell 

financial information about geographic areas 

we currently operate primarily within the united states however we have some nonoperating foreign entities which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

discontinued operations 

in 2007 income from discontinued operations included 187 million in refundable income taxes related to our investment in our discontinued mexico homebuilding operations we disposed of our mexico homebuilding operations in december 2005 

  

other nonoperating expenses 

other nonoperating expenses net consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publiclytraded entity listed on the new york stock exchange 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 5700 people of which approximately 900 people were employed in our verticallyintegrated construction operations in our southwest reporting segment and approximately 800 people were employed in our financial services operations except for certain employees in our st louis homebuilding division our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors our local and corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on a combination of individual performance and the performance of the applicable business unit subsidiary or the company each subsidiary is given a level of autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle which has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

prior to 2006 land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets however since early 2006 the homebuilding industry has been impacted by lack of consumer confidence rising unemployment a significant increase in the number of foreclosed homes and large supplies of resale and new home inventories which resulted in an industrywide softening of demand for new homes as a result of these factors we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability we have also incurred substantial impairments of our land and certain other assets we cannot predict the duration or the severity of the current market conditions nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

as a result of the changing market conditions in the homebuilding industry that have occurred since early 2006 we incurred significant landrelated charges in each of the respective periods resulting from the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs related to land transactions we no longer plan to pursue net realizable valuation adjustments related to land positions sold or held for sale impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future and impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures it is possible that the estimated cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation adjustments additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for additional impairments or writedowns which could result in additional charges that might be significant 

  

item 1a risk factors continued 

  

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in recent years we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank interest rates have been at historical lows for several years as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business beginning in early 2007 the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained as the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime alta and other nonconforming mortgage products our financial services business could also be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ additionally these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

in addition the federal reserve has purchased a sizeable amount of mortgagebacked securities in part to stabilize mortgage interest rates and to support the market for mortgagebacked securities recently the federal reserve announced plans to discontinue its purchase of mortgagebacked securities in the coming months the availability and affordability of mortgage loans including the consumer interest rates for such loans could be adversely affected by the federal reserve’s actions 

we also believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes the fha recently reported that its cash reserves have fallen below legal requirements due to defaults on mortgages it has insured and as a result it has and may continue to impose stricter loan qualification standards raise minimum down payment requirements impose higher mortgage insurance premiums and other costs andor limit the number of mortgages it insures the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is also critical to the housing market the impact of the federal government’s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac on the shortterm and longterm demand for new housing remains unclear any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

  

item 1a risk factors continued 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing significant volatility in many cases the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers we need liquidity for future growth and development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results one source of liquidity is our unsecured revolving credit facility in the event market conditions deteriorate further or we incur additional landrelated charges or other asset impairments we may violate certain financial covenants in the credit facility these violations if not waived by the lenders or cured could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility and could also result in a default under our 43 billion of senior notes 

the ability to reach an agreement with our lenders or to seek alternative sources of financing if necessary would depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the homebuilding industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreases further due to the market downturn at december 31 2009 we had cash and equivalents of 19 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor lumber framing concrete steel and other building materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sale contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our net income for such period 

  

item 1a risk factors continued 

  

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any continued 

  

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are appropriately recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results however if the reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets if the goodwill becomes impaired then our profits may be significantly reduced or eliminated and shareholders’ equity may be reduced 

we have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets related to prior business combinations we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we also perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value impairment is deemed to have occurred and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value this would result in a charge to our operating earnings we recorded goodwill impairments of 5630 million 57 million and 3700 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and have 8959 million and 1885 million of goodwill and intangible assets respectively remaining at december 31 2009 if management’s expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly additional impairments of either goodwill or intangible assets may occur 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income executing tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowance will fluctuate as conditions change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” builtin losses “bils” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income andor to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols bils and tax credit carryforwards we have not experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 to preserve our ability utilize nols bils and other tax benefits in the future without a section 382 limitation we adopted a shareholder rights plan which is triggered upon certain transfers of our securities and amended our bylaws to prohibit certain transfers of our securities notwithstanding the foregoing measures there can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section 382 

as a result of the merger with centex our ability to use certain of centex’s preownership change nols bils or deductions will be limited under section 382 of the internal revenue code the applicable section 382 limitation is approximately 68 million per year for nols losses realized on builtin loss assets that are sold within five years of the ownership change and certain deductions the limitation may result in a significant portion of centex’s preownership change nols bils and tax credit carryforwards or deductions not being available for our use 

  

item 1a risk factors continued 

  

pulte may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the centex merger 

the company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the centex merger will depend to a large extent on the ability of the company to integrate the businesses of centex with the company the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result the company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and centex the integration process may disrupt the business of the company and if implemented ineffectively would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by the company the failure of the company to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully the operations of centex or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the centex merger could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the company and could seriously harm its results of operations in addition the overall integration of the two companies may result in unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer and supplier relationships and diversion of management’s attention 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies these may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent in these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently costly and limited we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the united states could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

on august 18 2009 we completed the acquisition of centex through the merger of pulte’s merger subsidiary with and into centex pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger dated as of april 7 2009 among pulte pi nevada building company and centex as a result of the merger centex became a whollyowned subsidiary of pulte accordingly the results of centex are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the merger 

since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by a lack of consumer confidence tightened mortgage standards and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures these factors have contributed to weakened demand for new homes slower sales and increased price discounts and sales incentives to attract homebuyers during 2009 these conditions were accompanied by significant foreclosure activity increasing unemployment and significant uncertainty in the us economy as a result of the combination of these homebuilding industry mortgage financing and broader economic factors we have experienced a net loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006 such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments since the beginning of 2006 we have incurred total landrelated charges of 52 billion and goodwill impairments of 9387 million 

the us economy remains in a period of economic uncertainty and the related financial markets are experiencing significant volatility these factors have contributed to continued significant declines throughout the homebuilding industry in response to these adverse macroeconomic conditions the us government has made significant efforts to stabilize these conditions and increase the regulatory oversight of the financial markets however significant uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact these programs or their expiration will have on the demand for new housing including enactment into law on november 6 2009 of the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 the “act” the act amended section 172 of the internal revenue code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years previously limited to a twoyear carryback this change will allow us and certain of our subsidiaries to carry back 2009 taxable losses to prior years and receive refunds of previously paid federal income taxes the act also extended and expanded the current homebuyer tax credit until april 30 2010 

entering 2010 there are indications that certain of the aforementioned negative trends may be slowing or improving however there are also a number of factors that may further worsen market conditions or delay a recovery in the homebuilding industry such factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

overview continued 

  

accordingly we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term while we plan to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so our targeted profile for such investments consists of rolling lot option contracts for developed lots that are cash flow positive early in the project cycle and accretive to earnings additionally we are closely managing the number of speculative homes put into production we have also closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus we are also adjusting the content in our homes to provide our customers more affordable alternatives and are building homes with smaller floor plans in certain of our communities we are maintaining our focus on our lean operating goals a longterm initiative designed to extract unnecessary waste out of the home construction process the targeted benefits include better scheduling directorder materials eliminating waste at the construction site and reducing the amount of time it takes to build our homes as a result of the centex merger we expect to achieve significant savings in corporate and divisional overhead costs and interest costs for the combined entity as well as synergies in the areas of purchasing leverage and operational best practices we also anticipate that the centex merger will contribute to growth through expanded geographic and customer segment diversity and the ability to leverage additional brands we believe that the combination of our operational improvement activities with the benefits of the centex merger will help strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future 

if the current trends in economic conditions or financial market volatility continue it could adversely affect our business and results of operations in future periods including a further reduction in the demand for housing as well as difficulties in accessing financing on acceptable terms given these conditions and the continued weakness in new home sales and closings visibility as to future earnings performance is limited our evaluation for landrelated charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested if conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for further impairments or writedowns which could result in future charges that might be significant

the following is a summary of loss before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 home sale revenues for 2009 which include 11 billion related to centex were lower than those for 2008 by 21 billion or 35 and in 2008 were lower than those for 2007 by 29 billion or 33 the decrease in home sale revenues in 2009 and 2008 were attributable to decreases in unit settlements of 29 and 24 respectively combined with decreases in the average selling price of 9 and 12 respectively the decreases in average selling price in 2009 and 2008 reflect a combination of factors including changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the periods as well as lower market selling prices and elevated sales incentives home sale revenues unit settlements and average selling prices decreased in each of our homebuilding segments during 2009 and 2008 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2009 were negative 105 compared with negative 101 in 2008 and positive 50 in 2007 we recorded land and community valuation adjustments of 7512 million 12 billion and 16 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively gross profit margins were also adversely impacted in 2009 by the fair value adjustment related to homes under construction inventory acquired with the centex merger we recognized this fair value adjustment as an increase of 311 million to cost of sales as the related homes closed excluding these inventory valuation adjustments gross profit margins held steady in 2009 compared with 2008 while gross margins in 2008 were lower than 2007 primarily as a result of lower average selling prices 

we continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital land sale revenues and their related gains or losses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of land sales land sales had negative margin contributions of 1139 million 2622 million and 1780 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these negative margin contributions in 2009 2008 and 2007 included net realizable value adjustments totaling 1137 million 2711 million and 1992 million respectively related to land held for sale 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sale revenues increased to 163 compared with 130 in 2008 and 119 in 2007 while our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and matching our overall cost structure with the current business environment have resulted in significant reductions in our selling general and administrative expense we experienced an increase in our selling general and administrative expenses relative to home sale revenues during 2009 primarily as the result of duplicative corporate and divisional overhead costs during the transition period following the centex merger during 2009 homebuilding selling general and administrative expenses also include transaction and integration costs related to the centex merger including employee severance costs totaling 650 million employee severance costs during 2008 and 2007 totaled 281 million and 319 million respectively during 2009 we experienced a 19 decrease in selling general and administrative expenses compared with 2008 despite such mergerrelated costs and the duplicative overhead expenses discussed above the reductions in selling general and administrative expenses have been offset by reduced operating leverage resulting from the significant decrease in home sale revenues and lower absorption into inventory of overhead costs due to lower construction volumes in addition to the significant cuts in overhead spending such reductions were partially attributable to decreases in certain casualty insurancerelated expenses such expenses totaled 349 million 1035 million and 1412 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively while the majority of these decreases resulted from the lower sales volumes between periods our exposure to general liability product claims did not develop as adversely during 2009 as in 2008 and 2007 when we experienced significant increases in the frequency and severity of claims 

equity loss was 497 million 129 million and 1904 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the equity losses experienced for 2009 2008 and 2007 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 541 million 185 million and 1899 million respectively 

other income expense net includes the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions which totaled 543 million 333 million and 2397 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these writeoffs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital other income expense net includes certain integration costs including lease exit costs directly related to the centex merger totaling 275 million in 2009 other income expense during 2008 and 2007 includes lease termination costs and asset impairments totaling 133 million and 137 million respectively related to overhead reduction efforts 

other income expense net also includes goodwill impairment charges of 5630 million 50 million and 3700 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the 2008 and 2007 impairments resulted from the deteriorating market conditions throughout the homebuilding industry the 2009 impairment resulted from a number of factors including a significant decline in our overall market capitalization between the centex merger date and the goodwill valuation date in the fourth quarter the relationship of our market capitalization to our stockholders’ equity and the requirement under asc 350 to allocate all goodwill to our reporting units even though a significant portion of the goodwill is attributable to the economic value of deferred tax assets and corporate and financing synergies that are not directly reflected in the fair values of the individual reporting units if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly goodwill may be further impaired of our remaining goodwill of 8959 million at december 31 2009 approximately 350 million relates to reporting units that are at increased risk of future impairment management will continue to monitor these reporting units and perform goodwill impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable

 our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production representing 98 of loan originations for 2009 and 99 of loan originations in both 2008 and 2007 total financial services revenues during 2009 which include 306 million related to centex decreased 22 compared with 2008 primarily as a result of lower loan origination volume due to lower home settlements within our homebuilding operations financial services revenues for 2008 increased 12 compared with 2007 the increase was attributable to a combination of a shift in product mix to agency loans which are more profitable to us and the adoption of two new accounting standards sec staff accounting bulletin no 109 “written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings” “sab 109” and the financial instruments topic of the accounting standards codification these standards were adopted effective january 1 2008 and require that the fair value of interest rate lock loan commitments include the fair value of future servicing rights and that loans held for sale for which we elected the fair value option be carried at fair value rather than at the lower of cost or market the adoption of these standards resulted in an increase to mortgage operations revenues of 320 million during 2008 and an increase to expenses of 275 million partially offsetting these favorable impacts was a significant decrease in loan origination volume interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was significantly lower in 2009 than in 2008 and significantly lower in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to the decrease in loan origination volume revenues from our title operations increased 59 in 2009 compared with 2008 due to the centex merger and decreased 25 in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the declines in home settlements 

  

financial services operations continued 

  

mortgage origination unit volume and principal volume decreased 29 and 33 respectively in 2009 compared with 2008 and 35 and 36 respectively in 2008 compared with 2007 the decrease in unit volume is due primarily to lower home settlements excluding centex mortgage origination unit volume decreased 46 in 2009 compared with 2008 while mortgage origination principal volume decreased 48 in 2009 compared with 2008 agency production for funded origination principal was 99 98 and 82 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively within the funded agency origination principal fha loans were approximately 40 25 and 6 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our capture rate for 2009 was 853 while the capture rates for 2008 and 2007 were both 92 our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash settlements the decrease in mortgage origination principal volume resulted from the reduced settlement volume combined with lower average selling prices which reduced the average loan size at december 31 2009 our loan application backlog was 8779 million compared with 3420 million at december 31 2008 

the mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from adjustable rate mortgages “arms” which generally have a lower profit per loan to fixed rate mortgages during 2009 and 2008 interestonly mortgages a component of arms also decreased significantly during 2009 and 2008 substantially all loan production in 2009 and 2008 consisted of fixed rate loans the majority of which are prime conforming loans we define prime loans as full documentation first mortgages with fico scores of 621 or higher alta loans as nonfull documentation first mortgages with fico scores of 621 or higher and subprime loans as first mortgages with fico scores of 620 or lower 

income before income taxes decreased 831 million in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to decreased loan origination volumes lower values of servicing rights and increased loan loss reserves including 609 million related to mortgage loan repurchase obligations the 2009 loss before income taxes also includes certain integration costs directly related to the centex merger totaling 84 million income before income taxes decreased 35 in 2008 compared with 2007 as the higher mortgage operations revenues were offset by decreased loan origination volumes increased loan loss reserves an impairment of goodwill totaling 07 million and restructuring expenses of 41 million related to our overhead reduction initiatives 

since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate our overall loan loss reserves have historically not been significant during recent years however we experienced increased losses in our loans held for investment repurchased or reinsured loans and foreclosed properties the largest source for these losses has been a significant increase in actual and anticipated losses for loans previously originated and sold to investors which have increased as a result of the high level of loan defaults and related losses in the mortgage industry and increasing aggressiveness by investors in presenting such claims to the company additionally centex’s mortgage operations were historically broader than pulte mortgage’s so our exposure to losses related to loans previously originated has increased significantly as a result loan loss provisions related to our portfolio loans real estate owned and mortgage reinsurance included in expenses totaled 98 million 170 million and 78 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively additionally we recorded provisions for losses related to contingent consideration repurchase obligations of 609 million 24 million and 18 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

we are exposed to market risks from commitments to lend movements in interest rates and cancelled or modified commitments to lend a commitment to lend at a specific interest rate an interest rate lock commitment is a derivative financial instrument interest rate is locked to the borrower in order to reduce these risks we use other derivative financial instruments to economically hedge the interest rate lock commitment these financial instruments can include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury futures contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we enter into one of the aforementioned derivative financial instruments upon accepting interest rate lock commitments the changes in the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment and the other derivative financial instruments are included in financial services revenues we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

other nonoperating 

other nonoperating expenses consist of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange accordingly these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve the following table presents a summary of other nonoperating expenses 000’s omitted 

 

 the decrease in net interest income in 2009 compared with 2008 resulted from significantly lower interest rates on our invested cash balances net interest income in 2008 exceeded the prior year as a result of higher invested cash balances other income expense net includes gains losses on debt retirements of 316 million 16 million and 05 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the loss before income taxes also includes certain integration costs directly related to the centex merger totaling 54 million for 2009 which consists primarily of severance benefits additionally compared with the prior year period compensationrelated expenses increased in 2009 primarily as a result of duplicative corporate overhead expenses during the transition period following the centex merger other income expense net in 2008 exceeded 2007 primarily as a result of expenses related to the amendments of our unsecured revolving credit facility and the repurchase of 3134 million of our senior notes due 2009 by means of a tender offer completed in june 2008 

we capitalize interest cost into inventory during the active development and construction of our communities each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements interest expensed to homebuilding cost of revenues for 2009 2008 and 2007 includes 682 million 848 million and 1108 million respectively of capitalized interest related to inventory impairments during 2009 2008 and 2007 we capitalized all of our homebuilding interest costs into inventory because the level of our active inventory exceeded our debt levels as a result of our inventory management strategies and potential future inventory impairments it is reasonably possible that our debt levels will exceed the amount of our active inventory at some point during 2010 which would require us to expense some portion of our homebuilding interest costs as incurred 

information related to interest capitalized into inventory is as follows 000’s omitted 

 

  interest incurred includes interest on our senior debt shortterm borrowings and other financing arrangements and excludes interest incurred by our financial services operations 

income taxes 

our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors the most significant of which is the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets due to the effect of our valuation allowance adjustments in 2009 2008 and 2007 our effective tax rates for these years are not meaningful our effective tax rates were a benefit of 401 for 2009 compared with expense of 124 and 89 for 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

income taxes continued 

  

our 2009 income tax benefit of 7926 million is primarily due to the impact of the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 the “act” which was enacted into law on november 6 2009 the act amended section 172 of the internal revenue code to allow net operating losses realized in either tax year 2008 or 2009 to be carried back up to five years previously limited to two years the company recorded income taxes receivable of 8673 million at december 31 2009 related to net operating losses pursuant to the act 

the effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the effective tax rate for 2007 primarily as the result of the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2007 

discontinued operations 

in 2007 income from discontinued operations includes 187 million in refundable income taxes related to our investment in our discontinued mexico homebuilding operations we disposed of our mexico homebuilding operations in december 2005 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisitions development and construction activities by using internallygenerated funds and existing credit arrangements we routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources including securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if market conditions continue to deteriorate or if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations 

at december 31 2009 we had cash and equivalents of 19 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” we also had 43 billion of senior notes outstanding other financing included limited recourse landcollateralized financing totaling 20 million sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents our credit facility our unsecured letter of credit facility the “loc agreement” and pulte mortgage’s committed credit arrangements additionally we expect to receive significant federal tax refunds as a result of the carryback of taxable losses provided for under the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 we expect to receive the majority of these refunds in the first half of 2010 including the receipt of 1930 million in january 2010 

we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm investments generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities we monitor our investments with each bank on a daily basis and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however given the current volatility in the global financial markets there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding our landcollateralized and financial services debt was 573 at december 31 2009 and 428 net of cash and equivalents 

as of september 30 2009 the company was not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant under the credit facility the company subsequently requested and received a limited waiver from its banks until december 15 2009 permitting the company to utilize letters of credit under the credit facility during the term of the waiver on december 11 2009 the company entered into the fourth amendment and waiver to third amended and restated credit agreement which decreased the company’s borrowing capacity from 10 billion to 7500 million reduced the credit facility’s uncommitted accordion feature from 175 billion to 10 billion replaced the maximum debt to capitalization ratio with a maximum debt to tangible capital limit reduced the tangible net worth minimum and waived any default under the previous credit facility resulting from failure to comply with the tangible net worth financial covenant 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

under the terms of the credit facility we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to 7500 million borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding the credit facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of fitch ratings moody’s investor service and standard and poor’s corporation the “rating agencies” we currently do not have investment grade ratings from any of the rating agencies and are therefore subject to the borrowing base limitation given the uncertainty of current market conditions we anticipate operating under the borrowing base limitation throughout 2010 under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the credit facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets at december 31 2009 we had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining 2494 million under the credit facility after consideration of 5006 million of outstanding letters of credit as a result the borrowing base limitation did not restrict our borrowing at december 31 2009 

we are also required to maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test specifically if the interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility is less than 20 to 10 we are required to maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks while our access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted failure to maintain sufficient balances within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts our ability to utilize the credit facility we maintained the required cash and equivalents of 4151 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at december 31 2009 calculated under the credit facility as two times the amount by which the interest incurred over the last four quarters exceeds interest income over the last four quarters excluding financial services additionally failure to satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to libor margin and letter of credit pricing our interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 was negative 129 due to the increase in our senior notes outstanding resulting from the centex merger we expect the required cash and equivalents to be maintained within the liquidity reserve accounts to increase in 2010 for the period ending march 31 2010 we will be required to maintain cash and equivalents of 4556 million within the liquidity reserve accounts calculated as of december 31 2009 

the credit facility contains certain financial covenants we are required to not exceed a debt to tangible capital ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth covenant each quarter at december 31 2009 our debt to tangible capital ratio as defined in the credit facility was 573 compared with the requirement not to exceed 600 while our tangible net worth as defined in the credit facility cushion was 8557 million violations of the financial covenants in the credit facility if not waived by the lenders or cured could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in the event these violations were not waived by the lenders or cured the violations could also result in a default under the company’s 43 billion of senior notes 

as of december 31 2009 the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility however in the event market conditions deteriorate in the future or the company incurs additional landrelated charges the company’s compliance with the required covenant levels may be adversely impacted additionally the company’s ability to utilize the full capacity of the credit facility may be limited under the terms of the borrowing base 

in june 2009 the company entered into the loc agreement a fiveyear unsecured letter of credit facility that permits the issuance of up to 2000 million of letters of credit by the company the loc agreement supplements the company’s existing letter of credit capacity included in our credit facility at december 31 2009 286 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the loc agreement 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to its committed credit arrangements pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors at december 31 2009 pulte mortgage had 184 million outstanding under three separate master repurchase agreements with a total borrowing capacity of 1750 million subject to certain sublimits these repurchase agreements expire at different dates in 2010 beginning in may and contain various affirmative and negative covenants including certain financial covenants based on current market conditions there is a reasonable risk that pulte mortgage may not be able to comply with at least one of the required covenants prior to the maturity of the related repurchase agreement violations of any of the covenants in the repurchase agreements if not waived by the lenders or cured could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders which might require repayment of any borrowings given the uncertainty in the capital markets there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew or replace the repurchase agreements on commercially reasonable terms upon their expiration in the event of any of these occurrences we believe we have adequate liquidity to meet pulte mortgage’s anticipated financing needs 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

ctx mortgage which we acquired with the centex merger previously maintained a master repurchase agreement with jp morgan chase bank na that provided for advances of up to 500 million subject to certain sublimits and was scheduled to expire on january 31 2010 as of december 31 2009 we had transitioned all of ctx mortgage’s loan origination production to pulte mortgage accordingly we terminated ctx mortgage’s master repurchase agreement in december 2009 

pursuant to the two 1000 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october 2002 and 2005 and the 2000 million stock repurchase authorization in february 2007 for a total stock repurchase authorization of 400 million we have repurchased a total of 9688900 shares for a total of 2977 million there were no repurchases under these programs during 2009 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 1023 million at december 31 2009 

for the last three years we have generated significant positive cash flow primarily through the liquidation of land inventory without a corresponding level of reinvestment combined with refunds of income taxes paid in prior years we have used this positive cash flow to among other things increase our cash reserves as well as retire outstanding debt while we expect to receive significant federal tax refunds in the first half of 2010 there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to generate positive cash flow at the same levels in the future 

our net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 7389 million in 2009 and 12 billion in each of 2008 and 2007 the primary drivers of cash flow from operations are profitability and inventory levels for the years 2007 through 2009 our net loss was largely attributable to noncash asset impairments including landrelated charges and investments in unconsolidated entities goodwill impairments and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance we have also generated significant cash flow by focusing on rightsizing our land and house inventory in 2009 and 2008 to better match current market conditions which resulted in a significant net decrease to inventories in addition we received federal income tax refunds totaling 3620 million 2121 million and 675 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

cash provided by investing activities totaled 17 billion in 2009 substantially all of which resulted from the 17 billion of cash acquired with the centex merger excluding cash acquired with the centex merger cash used in investing activities decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily as a result of lower investments in unconsolidated entities offset by higher capital expenditures cash used in investing activities was 559 million in 2008 compared with 2214 million in 2007 the significant decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2008 compared with 2007 resulted primarily from lower investments in unconsolidated entities and lower capital expenditures 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 22 billion 5677 million and 4876 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the significant increase in cash used in investing activities in 2009 resulted primarily from the repurchase of 15 billion of senior notes during a tender offer completed in september 2009 we also retired 2364 million of senior notes at scheduled maturity dates and repurchased an additional 1929 million of senior notes during 2009 the increase in net cash used in 2008 compared with 2007 was largely attributable to the repurchase of 3134 million of senior notes by means of a tender offer in 2008 compared with total senior note repurchases of 612 million in 2007 this was partially offset by reduced repayments under our financial services credit agreements as the result of lower volumes 

on november 24 2008 our board of directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on our common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in substantially all of our markets if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly affecting our prospective homebuyers’ ability to adequately finance home purchases our revenues gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

seasonality 

we experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry historically we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements however the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  

  

 we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including land option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them this reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2009 we had agreements to acquire 16421 homesites through option contracts at december 31 2009 we had 1408 million of nonrefundable option deposits and preacquisition costs related to these agreements 

at december 31 2009 we had 3261 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 806 million of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 19982008 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  

   

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use letters of credit and performance and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2009 we had outstanding letters of credit of 5292 million performance bonds and surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 29 billion at december 31 2009 are typically outstanding over a period of approximately three to five years we do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance or surety bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2009 these agreements totaled approximately 6665 million pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices in certain instances we are required to record the land under option as if we own it at december 31 2009 we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of 1741 million as land not owned under option agreements 

at december 31 2009 aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 695 million of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was 253 million of our proportionate share of joint venture debt we provided limited recourse guaranties for 190 million of such joint venture debt at december 31 2009 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

for 2009 2008 and 2007 we recognized equity loss from our unconsolidated joint ventures of 497 million 128 million and 1900 million respectively the equity loss recognized during 2009 2008 and 2007 includes land valuation adjustments of 541 million 185 million and 1899 million respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by asc 36020 “property plant and equipment  real estate sales” the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

financial services – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned with the adoption of sfas 159 codified within asc 825 “financial instruments” effective january 1 2008 loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred previously such fees and costs were deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related loans and recognized as an adjustment to revenues upon the sale of such loans gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

inventory valuation 

inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value as determined in accordance asc 36010 “property plant and equipment – impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “asc 36010” accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements 

cost of sales includes the construction cost average lot cost estimated warranty costs and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

in accordance with asc 36010 we record valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a combination of market comparable transactions where available and discounted cash flow models these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

investments in unconsolidated entities 

we have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities including joint ventures with independent third parties many of these unconsolidated entities purchase develop andor sell land and homes in the united states and puerto rico the equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20 and not more than 50 under the equity method of accounting we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities certain of these entities sell land to us in these situations we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold the cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20 ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

investments in unconsolidated entities continued 

  

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with asc 323 “investments – equity method and joint ventures” if we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary we write down the investment to its estimated fair value any such losses are recorded to equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations additionally each unconsolidated entity evaluates its longlived assets such as inventory for recoverability in accordance with asc 36010 our proportionate share of any such impairments under asc 36010 are also recorded to equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations evaluations of recoverability under both asc 323 and asc 36010 are primarily based on projected cash flows due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans 

prior to january 1 2008 residential mortgage loans availableforsale were stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value in accordance with asc 825 “financial instruments” “asc 825” we elected the fair value option for our portfolio loans availableforsale and for first mortgage loans originated subsequent to december 31 2007 asc 825 permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contractbycontract basis election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loans held for investment consist of interim financing mortgage loans for certain of our customers as well as a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing these loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful 

mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities 

our mortgage operations have established liabilities for anticipated losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors that may result from borrower fraud borrower early payment defaults or loans that have not been underwritten in accordance with the investor guidelines in the normal course of business our mortgage operations also provide limited indemnities for certain loans sold to investors we establish the liabilities for such anticipated losses based upon among other things historical loss rates current trends in loan originations and the geographic location of the underlying collateral 

from time to time our mortgage operations will be required to repurchase certain loans we originated and sold to third parties if a repurchased loan is performing it is classified as a residential mortgage loan availableforsale and recorded at fair value such repurchased loans are typically resold to third party investors if a repurchased loan is nonperforming the loan is classified as loans held for investment we establish an allowance for such loans based on our historical loss experience and current loss trends 

although we consider our mortgage loan allowances and loan origination liabilities reflected in our condensed consolidated balance sheets to be adequate there can be no assurance that these allowances and liabilities will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations these allowances and liabilities may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy the mortgage market or discrete events adversely affecting specific borrowers 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill related to the centex merger completed in 2009 goodwill which represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of the net assets at the acquisition date is subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation methods including the use of discounted cash flows supplemented by marketbased assessments of fair value and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded carrying value such fair values are significantly impacted by estimates related to current market valuations current and future economic conditions in each of our geographical markets and our strategic plans within each of our markets due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing actual results could differ significantly from such estimates if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly goodwill may be impaired 

we have also recorded certain intangible assets related to tradenames acquired with the centex merger completed in 2009 and the del webb merger completed in 2001 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives the carrying values and ultimate realization of these assets are dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if we determine that the carrying values of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists if the carrying values of the intangible assets exceed the expected undiscounted cash flows then we measure impairment as the difference between the fair value of the asset and the recorded carrying value if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly or if our strategy related to the use of such intangible assets changes the related intangible assets may be impaired 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a one to twoyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates 

selfinsured risks 

we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and related lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including extended lag times in the reporting and resolution of claims which generally occur over several years and can occur in excess of ten years and trends or changes in claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations as a result actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 

stockbased compensation 

we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

income taxes 

we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” codified within asc 740 “income taxes” “asc 740” effective january 1 2007 fin 48 created a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provided guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and settlements of audit issues

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financing to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2009 and 2008 our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value 000’s omitted 

 

 the increase in senior notes outstanding at december 31 2009 compared with december 31 2008 resulted from the senior notes assumed with the centex merger 

pulte mortgage operating as a mortgage banker is also subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreedupon terms ie commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2009 and 2008 this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

we minimize interest rate risk by i financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to libor and ii hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of plus 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results 

at december 31 2009 our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining nonoperating investments in mexico which approximated 02 million

internal control over financial reporting 

 

 management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management’s judgments and estimates concerning events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed 

management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control and effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation additionally because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

in order to ensure that the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of december 31 2009 management’s assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission on august 18 2009 the company completed the acquisition of centex corporation “centex” as permitted by the securities and exchange commission management excluded the centex operations from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 centex operations constituted approximately 21 billion of consolidated total assets excluding goodwill and other intangible assets as of december 31 2009 and 11 billion of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended based on this assessment management asserts that the company has maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009

internal control over financial reporting continued 

  

 the board of directors and shareholders of pulte homes inc 

we have audited pulte homes inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria pulte homes inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of centex corporation which is included in the 2009 consolidated financial statements of pulte homes inc and constituted 21 billion of total assets excluding goodwill and other intangible assets as of december 31 2009 and 11 billion of revenues for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of pulte homes inc also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of centex corporation 

in our opinion pulte homes inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of pulte homes inc as of december 31 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 and our report dated february 19 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item i business tableend pulte homes inc 

pulte homes inc the “company” is a publiclyheld holding company whose subsidiaries engage in the homebuilding and financial services businesses pulte homes inc is a michigan corporation and was organized in 1956 our assets consist principally of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries our direct subsidiaries include pulte diversified companies inc del webb corporation “del webb” and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business pulte diversified companies inc’s operating subsidiaries include pulte home corporation pulte international corporation “international” and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business we also have a mortgage banking company pulte mortgage llc “pulte mortgage” which is a subsidiary of pulte home corporation 

since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by a lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability tightened mortgage standards and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures these factors have contributed to weakened demand for new homes slower sales higher cancellation rates and increased price discounts and sales incentives to attract homebuyers during 2008 these conditions continued to deteriorate and were accompanied by increased foreclosure activity constraints on the availability of certain mortgage financing products increasing unemployment and significant uncertainty in the us economy as a result of the combination of these homebuilding industry mortgage financing and broader economic factors we have experienced a net loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006 such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments 

homebuilding our core business is engaged in the acquisition and development of land primarily for residential purposes within the continental united states and the construction of housing on such land targeted for firsttime first and second moveup and active adult home buyers our reportable homebuilding segments are as follows 

 

   we also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations conducted through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries our financial services segment operates generally in the same markets as our homebuilding segments

homebuilding operations 

 

 through our brands which include pulte homes del webb and divosta we offer a wide variety of home designs including single family detached townhouses condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to all of our major customer segments firsttime first and second moveup and active adult over our 59year history we have delivered over 500000 homes 

as of december 31 2008 our homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 459 communities sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 84 of our communities fall within the range of 100000 to 400000 with a 2008 average unit selling price of 284000 compared with 322000 in 2007 337000 in 2006 315000 in 2005 and 287000 in 2004 sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 75 in 2008 compared with 74 in both 2007 and 2006 72 in 2005 and 80 in 2004 the increase in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to a weakened demand for townhouses condominiums and duplexes as prices for detached new homes have become more affordable for firsttime and active adult homebuyers our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result help to insulate us from demand changes in individual markets as of december 31 2008 our homebuilding business operated in 49 markets spanning 25 states 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 631 million 2174 units at december 31 2008 and 25 billion 7890 units at december 31 2007 for each order in backlog we have received a signed customer contract and the required customer deposit which is refundable in certain instances of the orders in backlog at december 31 2008 substantially all are scheduled to be closed during 2009 though all orders are subject to potential cancellation by the customer in the event of cancellation the majority of our sales contracts stipulate that we have the right to retain the customer’s deposit though we may choose not to retain the deposit in certain instances 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

land acquisition and development 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers though we periodically sell select parcels of land to third parties for commercial or other development additionally we may determine that certain of our land assets no longer fit into our strategic operating plans we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of option contracts we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes as a result land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2008 we controlled 120796 lots of which 97473 were owned and 23323 were under option agreements 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer profiles segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group 

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features in certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which most features shown in the home are included in the sales price 

typically our sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the superintendent 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have success with the firsttime buyer in the low to moderate price range in such cases financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company we also enjoy sales to the moveup buyer and in certain markets offer semicustom homes in higher price ranges 

through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults among the fastest growing homebuying segments we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these communities with highly amenitized products such as golf courses recreational centers and educational classes offer the active adult buyer many options to maintain an active lifestyle

we have received recognition and awards as a result of our achievements as a homebuilder in april 2008 we ranked 282 on the fortune 500 list in addition our albuquerque central valley chicago del webb ft myersnaples houston inland empire calif del webb jacksonville laventura orlando palm beach divosta philadelphia del webb tucson del webb and washington dc operations were recognized for ranking the highest in their markets in the jd power and associates ® 2008 newhome builder customer satisfaction study six of our operations ranked second in their respective markets while three operations ranked third pulte brands which include pulte homes del webb and divosta were surveyed in 26 of the 33 total markets analyzed the survey noted customer service home readiness at the time of closing and the company’s sales staff as the three factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of satisfaction the 2008 homebuilder rankings also included studies which evaluated homebuyers’ satisfaction with newhome quality and newhome design our market operations earned top rankings for newhome quality in seven markets tied for the most among all builders and earned the most top rankings for newhome design with top scores in six markets 

our homeowner for life tm philosophy has increased our business from customers who have previously owned a pulte home or have been referred by a pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home owning experience we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements and other advertising displays in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom and wwwdivostacom provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us approximately 55 million potential customers visited our websites during 2008 

construction 

the construction process for our homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we continue to shift toward component offsite manufacturing methods to provide high efficiency high quality and lower cost products to our customers we believe that our trades are an extension of our production system and jointly focus on lean construction techniques to bring the highest value possible to our customers while setting the standard in trade relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes 

we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and utilizing standard construction practices to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating certain of our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives 

we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future while the availability of materials and labor is not a significant concern under current market conditions we have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets in recent years 

competition and other factors 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration “fha” or veterans administration “va” mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

competition and other factors continued 

  

our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is fragmented and highly competitive in each of our local markets there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with the resales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units for sale or to rent including apartment operators may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in the costs of building materials and labor 3 changes in interest rates 4 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 5 various demographic factors 6 changes in federal income tax laws 7 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 8 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes 

our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth quarters however during 2008 we continued to experience challenging conditions in most of our markets which contributed to decreased revenues and closings as compared to prior periods including prior quarters thereby reducing typical seasonal variations 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries pulte mortgage arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma fhlmc and private investors 

our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado using a centralized fulfillment center we also use centralized loan officers in an origination center located in denver we believe centralizing both the fulfillment and origination of our loans improves the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers in 2008 we had a high level of utilization of our online customer questionnaire the majority of our customers now send us their data online to start the mortgage process once the questionnaire is received an interview is scheduled and the combination of the interview with the data sent online represents our mortgage application 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans to outside investors 

our capture rates for 2008 2007 and 2006 were 92 92 and 91 respectively our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements during 2008 2007 and 2006 we originated mortgage loans for 72 76 and 77 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years 

we sell our servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 days after sale 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

financial services continued 

  

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in selected markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell 

financial information about geographic areas 

we currently operate primarily within the united states however we have some nonoperating foreign entities which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

discontinued operations 

in 2007 income loss from discontinued operations includes 187 million in refundable income taxes related to our investment in our discontinued mexico homebuilding operations we disposed of our mexico homebuilding operations in december 2005

 item 1a risk factors tableend discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle which has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

prior to 2006 land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets however since early 2006 the homebuilding industry has been impacted by lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability rising unemployment a significant increase in the number of foreclosed homes and large supplies of resale and new home inventories which resulted in an industrywide softening of demand for new homes as a result of these factors we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability we have also incurred substantial impairments of our land and certain other assets we cannot predict the duration or the severity of the current market conditions nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to write down our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

as a result of the changing market conditions in the homebuilding industry that have occurred since early 2006 we incurred significant landrelated charges in each of the respective periods resulting from the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs related to land transactions we no longer plan to pursue net realizable valuation adjustments related to land positions sold or held for sale impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future and impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures it is possible that the estimated cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation adjustments additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for additional impairments or writedowns which could result in additional charges that might be significant 

  

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build in recent years we experienced significant competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank interest rates have been at historical lows for several years as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business beginning in early 2007 the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained as the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime alta and other nonconforming mortgage products while we do not retain any material risks associated with the loans we originate our financial services business could be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ additionally these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

in addition we believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes we also believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

  

adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital and cost of capital 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility in recent months the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels in many cases the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for issuers 

we need liquidity for future growth and development of our business without sufficient liquidity we may not be able to purchase additional land or develop land which could adversely affect our financial results one source of liquidity is our unsecured revolving credit facility in the event market conditions deteriorate further or we incur additional landrelated charges or other asset impairments we may violate certain financial covenants in the credit facility these violations if not waived by the lenders or cured could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility and could also result in a default under our 32 billion of senior notes 

the ability to reach an agreement with our lenders or to seek alternative sources of financing if necessary will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to the homebuilding industry our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if the level of our business activity decreases further due to the market downturn at december 31 2008 we had cash and equivalents of 17 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility however our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor lumber framing concrete steel and other building materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sale contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

  

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our net income for such period 

we are periodically audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are appropriately recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results however if the reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income executing tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets the valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change 

our ability to utilize net operating losses “nols” and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future taxable income andor to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code the “irc” in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the irc increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period 

an ownership change under section 382 of the irc would establish an annual limitation to the amount of nols and tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our nols and tax credit carryforwards we have not experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 however whether a change in ownership occurs in the future is largely outside of our control and there can be no assurance that such a change will not occur 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

  

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results continued 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies these may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the united states could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

since early 2006 the us housing market has been unfavorably impacted by a lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability tightened mortgage standards and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures these factors have contributed to weakened demand for new homes slower sales higher cancellation rates and increased price discounts and sales incentives to attract homebuyers during 2008 these conditions continued to deteriorate and were accompanied by increased foreclosure activity constraints on the availability of certain mortgage financing products increasing unemployment and significant uncertainty in the us economy as a result of the combination of these homebuilding industry mortgage financing and broader economic factors we have experienced a net loss in each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2006 such losses resulted from a combination of reduced operational profitability and significant asset impairments since the beginning of 2006 we have incurred total landrelated charges of 43 billion and goodwill impairments of 3757 million 

we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term we expect these trends in our unit settlements and pricing to continue and the majority of the markets we serve to remain challenging throughout 2009 we have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and development and construction practices and continue to shorten our land pipeline limit land development expenditures reduce production volumes and balance home price and profitability with sales pace and cash flow at each of our communities we are delaying planned land purchases and development spending and have significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option additionally we are closely managing the number of speculative homes put into production while we will continue to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so we anticipate minimal investment in new land parcels in the near term we have also closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses as a result of these actions we incurred restructuring charges of 455 million during 2008 in may 2007 we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve ongoing operating efficiencies which resulted in related charges of 457 million in 2007 due to the persistence of these difficult market conditions improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus we believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future 

the us economy is currently undergoing a period of economic uncertainty and the related financial markets are experiencing significant volatility in response the us government has made significant efforts in recent months to stabilize these conditions and increase the regulatory oversight of the financial markets these actions have included 

 

  

  

  

 while the ultimate impact of laws already enacted are not yet known thus far these actions have not proven stimulative for the homebuilding industry due to the uncertainties as to the provisions that may be included in any future legislation we can not estimate the impact that such new laws if enacted would have on our business or future results of operations 

  

overview continued 

if the current trends in economic conditions or financial market volatility continue it could adversely affect our business and results of operations in future periods including a further reduction in the demand for housing as well as difficulties in accessing financing on acceptable terms given these conditions and the continued weakness in new home sales and closings visibility as to future earnings performance is limited our evaluation for landrelated charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested if conditions in the homebuilding industry or our local markets worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for further impairments or writedowns which could result in future charges that might be significant

 the following is a comparison of income loss before income taxes for 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

  

  

   

homebuilding operations 

the following is a summary of income loss before income taxes for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 

 

  

     home sale revenues for 2008 were lower than those for 2007 by 29 billion or 33 and in 2007 were lower than those for 2006 by 51 billion or 36 the lower home sale revenues in 2008 and 2007 were attributable to decreases in unit settlements of 24 and 34 respectively combined with decreases in the average selling price of 12 and 4 respectively the declines in unit settlements resulted from both reductions in the number of our active communities down 28 and 8 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively compared with the respective prior year and the challenging sales conditions in our local markets the decreases in average selling price in 2008 and 2007 reflect a combination of factors including changes in the product and geographic mix of homes closed during the periods as well as lower market selling prices and higher sales incentives home sale revenues unit settlements and average selling prices decreased in all of our homebuilding segments during 2008 and 2007 

homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2008 were negative 101 compared with negative 50 in 2007 and positive 174 in 2006 the significant decreases in gross profit margins that commenced in 2006 and continued through 2008 were attributable to the difficult market conditions and challenging sales environment which have resulted in lower average selling prices and increased sales incentives in addition we recorded land and community valuation adjustments of 12 billion 16 billion and 2038 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

homebuilding operations continued 

  

we continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital land sale revenues and their related gains or losses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of land sales gross profit from land sales had negative margin contributions of 2622 million 1780 million and 387 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these negative margin contributions in 2008 2007 and 2006 included net realizable value adjustments totaling 2711 million 1992 million and 546 million respectively related to land held for sale 

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sale revenues increased to 130 compared with 119 in 2007 and 81 in 2006 while our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and matching our overall cost structure with the current business environment have resulted in significant reductions in our selling general and administrative expenses since 2006 these reductions have been offset by reduced operating leverage resulting from the significant decrease in home sale revenues and lower absorption into inventory of overhead costs due to lower construction volumes we incurred employee severance costs related to overhead reductions totaling 281 million in 2008 we also initiated a restructuring plan in may 2007 that resulted in employee severance costs totaling 319 million in 2007 additionally we incurred incremental insurancerelated expenses in 2008 and 2007 related to the adverse development of general liability product claims 

equity loss was 129 million 1904 million and 952 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the equity losses experienced for 2008 2007 and 2006 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 185 million 1899 million and 954 million respectively 

other income expense net includes the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions which totaled 333 million 2397 million and 1512 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these writeoffs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital other income expense net also includes goodwill impairment charges of 50 million and 3700 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively additionally other income expense net includes restructuring charges primarily asset impairments and lease termination costs of 133 million in 2008 related to overhead reduction efforts 137 million in 2007 related to the reorganization initiated in may 2007 and 185 million in 2006 related to the closure of a production facility located in virginia 

for 2008 net new order units decreased 39 to 15306 units compared with 2007 for 2007 net new order units decreased 26 to 25175 units compared with 2006 cancellation rates were 33 33 and 29 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively most markets experienced a substantial increase in resale and new home inventory and this combined with declining consumer confidence decreased housing affordability difficulties experienced by customers in selling their existing homes and the more restrictive mortgage financing market has resulted in higher than historical cancellation rates and reduced net new orders during 2008 2007 and 2006

for 2008 california home sale revenues decreased 45 compared with 2007 due to a 34 decrease in unit settlements combined with a 16 decrease in average selling prices as all of our california markets experienced home sale revenue reductions this reduction in revenues and significant decline in gross margin contributed to the loss before income taxes which also included 2700 million in landrelated charges and a 154 million valuation adjustment related to unconsolidated joint ventures the 2008 loss before income taxes was lower than in 2007 primarily due to the lower landrelated charges which totaled 4681 million in 2007 in 2007 california also recorded valuation adjustments totaling 1283 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures excluding landrelated charges our bay area market experienced the most sizable decrease in gross margin net new orders declined by 48 in 2008 due to the difficult market conditions cancellation rates were 44 in 2008 compared with 43 in 2007

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services operations which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries we originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors also we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

 

 total financial services revenues for 2008 increased 12 compared with 2007 the increase was attributable to a combination of a shift in product mix to agency loans which are more profitable to us and the adoption of two new accounting standards sec staff accounting bulletin no 109 “written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings” “sab 109” and sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” these standards were adopted effective january 1 2008 and require that the fair value of interest rate lock loan commitments include the fair value of future servicing rights and that loans held for sale for which we elected the fair value option be carried at fair value rather than at the lower of cost or market the adoption of these standards resulted in an increase to mortgage operations revenues of 320 million during 2008 and an increase to expenses of 275 million partially offsetting these favorable impacts was a significant decrease in loan origination volume interest income which is included in mortgage operations revenues was 39 lower in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to the significant decrease in loan origination volume for 2007 interest income decreased 35 compared with 2006 also due to the decrease in loan origination volume partially offset by higher loan yields resulting from the shift to agency loans revenues from our title operations decreased 25 in 2008 compared with 2007 and 30 in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the declines in home settlements 

mortgage origination unit volume and principal volume decreased 35 and 36 respectively in 2008 compared with 2007 and 42 and 39 respectively in 2007 compared with 2006 the decrease in unit volume is due primarily to lower home settlements our capture rates for 2008 2007 and 2006 were 92 92 and 91 respectively our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash settlements the decrease in mortgage origination principal volume resulted from the reduced settlement volume combined with lower average selling prices which reduced the average loan size our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production representing nearly 100 of pulte mortgage unit production for 2008 2007 and 2006 at december 31 2008 our loan application backlog was 3420 million compared with 15 billion and 21 billion at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

financial services operations continued 

  

the table below provides certain selected operating data for our financial services operations 

 

   the mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from adjustable rate mortgages “arms” which generally have a lower profit per loan to fixed rate mortgages during 2008 and 2007 interestonly mortgages a component of arms also decreased significantly during 2008 and 2007 because we sell our loans monthly and retain only limited risk for sold loans for a short period of time we believe that our financial services operations do not have any material direct risks related to subprime and alta loans however the availability of certain mortgage financing products has become more constrained as the mortgage industry is now more closely scrutinizing subprime alta and other nonconforming mortgage products these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of both our homebuilding and financial services businesses 

income before income taxes decreased 35 in 2008 compared with 2007 as the higher mortgage operations revenues were offset by decreased loan origination volumes increased loan loss reserves an impairment of goodwill totaling 07 million and restructuring expenses of 41 million related to our overhead reduction initiatives income before income taxes decreased 63 in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the sale of our investment in su casita a mexicobased mortgage banking company in 2006 as a result of this transaction we recognized a pretax gain of approximately 316 million in 2006 excluding this gain income before income taxes still decreased significantly in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to lower loan origination volumes and increased loan loss reserves this decrease was partially offset by an increase in average loan size and the shift in funded product mix toward fixed rate and agency loans which are more profitable for us 

since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate our overall loan loss reserves have historically not been significant during 2008 and 2007 however we experienced increases in our loans held for investment nonperforming portfolio loans and foreclosed properties as well as higher expected losses on repurchased or reinsured loans as a result our overall loan loss reserves increased to 234 million at december 31 2008 compared with 124 million and 21 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively loan loss provisions included in expenses totaled 204 million 116 million and 15 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

we hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

other nonoperating 

other nonoperating expenses consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange accordingly these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve the following table presents a summary of other nonoperating expenses 000’s omitted 

 

 the increases in net interest income in 2008 and 2007 resulted from higher average invested cash balances and lower borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility other expenses net in 2008 exceeded those in 2007 primarily as a result of expenses related to the amendments of our unsecured revolving credit facility and the repurchase of 3134 million of our senior notes due 2009 by means of a tender offer completed in june 2008 the lower levels of other expenses net in 2008 and 2007 compared with 2006 resulted primarily from reductions in compensationrelated costs 

interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities interest expensed to homebuilding cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 includes 848 million 1108 million and 160 million respectively related to land and community valuation adjustments information related to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows 000’s omitted 

 

  

 income taxes 

our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors income taxes were provided at an effective tax rate of 124 89 and 363 for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were lower than the rate for 2006 due to the noncash deferred tax asset valuation allowances and impairments of goodwill recorded in those periods excluding the valuation allowances and goodwill impairment charges which are discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 would have been approximately 373 and 381 respectively 

  

discontinued operations 

in 2007 income loss from discontinued operations includes 187 million in refundable income taxes related to the our investment in our discontinued mexico homebuilding operations we disposed of our mexico homebuilding operations in december 2005 

in 2006 income loss from discontinued operations includes a provision of 23 million net of tax which resulted from a contractual adjustment related to the disposition of our mexico homebuilding operations in december 2005 income loss from discontinued operations for 2006 also includes 02 million of income net of tax related to the disposal of first heights our former bank subsidiary which was completed in 2005 a provision of 01 million net of tax resulting from a contractual adjustment related to the january 2005 disposition of our former argentina homebuilding operations is also included in income loss from discontinued operations in 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our land acquisitions development and construction activities by using internallygenerated funds and existing credit arrangements we routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources including securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our current and foreseeable capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are appropriate if market conditions continue to deteriorate or if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations 

at december 31 2008 we had cash and equivalents of 17 billion and no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility we also had 32 billion of senior notes outstanding other financing included limited recourse landcollateralized financing totaling 57 million sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents our committed unsecured revolving credit facility and pulte mortgage’s committed credit arrangements 

we follow a diversified investment approach for our cash and equivalents by maintaining such funds with a diversified portfolio of banks within our group of relationship banks in high quality highly liquid shortterm investments generally money market funds and federal government or agency securities we monitor our investments with each bank on a daily basis and do not believe our cash and equivalents are exposed to any material risk of loss however given the current volatility in the global financial markets there can be no assurances that losses of principal balance on our cash and equivalents will not occur 

our ratio of debttototal capitalization excluding our landcollateralized and pulte mortgage debt was 528 at december 31 2008 and 348 net of cash and equivalents 

we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility twice during 2008 decreasing the borrowing capacity from 186 billion to 12 billion adjusting the required tangible net worth minimum and maximum allowed debttototal capitalization ratio increasing the costs of borrowing or issuing letters of credit and establishing certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event that we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test the maturity date of june 2012 was not impacted under the terms of the credit facility we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to 1125 billion borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding the credit facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of fitch ratings moody’s investor service and standard and poor’s corporation the “rating agencies” we currently do not have investment grade ratings from any of the rating agencies and are therefore subject to the borrowing base limitation given the uncertainty of current market conditions we anticipate operating under the borrowing base limitation throughout 2009 under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the revolving credit facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets at december 31 2008 we had no borrowings outstanding and full availability of the remaining 8467 million under the credit facility after consideration of 3533 million of outstanding letters of credit as a result the borrowing base limitation did not restrict our borrowing at december 31 2008 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

effective with the november 2008 amendment we are required to maintain certain liquidity reserve accounts in the event we fail to satisfy an interest coverage test specifically if the interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility is less than 20 to 10 we are required to maintain cash and equivalents in designated accounts with certain banks while our access to and utilization of cash and equivalents maintained in liquidity reserve accounts is not restricted failure to maintain sufficient balances within the liquidity reserve accounts restricts our ability to utilize the credit facility we maintained the required cash and equivalents of 3933 million within the liquidity reserve accounts at december 31 2008 additionally failure to satisfy the interest coverage test can also result in an increase to libor margin and letter of credit pricing 

the credit facility contains certain financial covenants we are required to not exceed a debttototal capitalization ratio as well as to meet a tangible net worth minimum each quarter at december 31 2008 our debttototal capitalization ratio as defined in the credit facility was 494 compared with the requirement not to exceed 55 while our tangible net worth as defined in the credit facility cushion was 722 million violations of any of the covenants in the credit facility if not waived by the lenders or cured could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders which might require repayment of any borrowings and replacement or cash collateralization of any letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility in the event these violations were not waived by the lenders or cured the violations could also result in a default under our 32 billion of senior notes as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility however in the event market conditions deteriorate in the future or we incur additional landrelated charges our compliance with the required covenant levels may be adversely impacted additionally our ability to utilize the full capacity of the credit facility may be limited under the terms of the borrowing base 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to its committed credit arrangements pulte mortgage uses these resources to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to third party investors at december 31 2008 pulte mortgage had a committed credit arrangement consisting of a 405 million revolving credit facility which expires may 2009 the previous assetbacked commercial paper program was repaid and terminated in may 2008 the revolving credit facility requires pulte mortgage to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth minimum each month and restricts funded debt to 15 times tangible net worth at december 31 2008 pulte mortgage had 2376 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility we believe that pulte mortgage will be able to renew or replace its revolving credit facility when it expires however given the uncertainty in the capital markets there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete such renewal or replacement on commercially reasonable terms in the event of such an occurrence we believe we have capacity through other sources to meet pulte mortgage’s anticipated financing needs 

pursuant to the two 100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october 2002 and 2005 and the 200 million stock repurchase authorization in february 2006 for a total stock repurchase authorization of 400 million we have repurchased a total of 9688900 shares for a total of 2977 million there were no repurchases under these programs during 2008 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 1023 million at december 31 2008 

our net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 12 billion in each of 2008 and 2007 for 2006 net cash used in operating activities was 2675 million the primary drivers of cash flow from operations are inventory levels and profitability in 2008 and 2007 our net loss was largely attributable to noncash asset impairments including landrelated charges and investments in unconsolidated entities goodwill impairments and a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in addition we focused on rightsizing our land and house inventory in 2008 and 2007 to better match current market conditions which resulted in a significant net decrease to inventories in 2006 net income was offset primarily by significant investments in land inventory 

cash used in investing activities was 559 million in 2008 compared with 2214 million in 2007 and 869 million in 2006 the significant decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2008 compared with 2007 resulted primarily from reduced investments in unconsolidated entities and lower capital expenditures the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared with 2006 resulted primarily from investments of 2175 million in unconsolidated entities in addition we received cash of 492 million in 2006 for the sale of subsidiaries and equity investments primarily resulting from the sale of our mexico homebuilding operations though this was offset by the use of 658 million net of cash acquired to purchase the remaining 50 of our verticallyintegrated construction operations in our southwest reporting segment 

  

liquidity and capital resources continued 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 5677 million 4876 million and 962 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the cash used in financing activities in 2008 2007 and 2006 was largely attributable to reductions in outstanding borrowings under various credit arrangements as the result of the lower volumes in our homebuilding and financial services operations additionally we repurchased 3134 million of our senior notes due 2009 by means of a tender offer completed in june 2008 offsetting this to some degree in 2008 and 2007 was a significant reduction in stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs 

on november 24 2008 our board of directors discontinued the regular quarterly dividend on our common stock effective in the first quarter of 2009 

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in substantially all of our markets if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly affecting our prospective homebuyers’ ability to adequately finance home purchases our revenues gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 

seasonality 

we experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry historically we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements however the challenging market conditions experienced since early 2006 have lessened the seasonal variations of our results given the current significant uncertainty in the homebuilding industry we can make no assurances as to when and whether our historical seasonality will recur 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

 we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them this reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2008 we had agreements to acquire 23323 homesites through option contracts at december 31 2008 we had 2241 million of nonrefundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements 

at december 31 2008 we had 1263 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 361 million of related accrued interest and penalties we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 19982007 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2008 

 

    

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2008 we had outstanding letters of credit of 3639 million performance bonds and surety bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 11 billion at december 31 2008 are typically outstanding over a period of approximately 35 years we do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2008 these agreements totaled approximately 13 billion pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity at december 31 2008 we consolidated certain land option agreements and recorded assets of 1566 million as land not owned under option agreements 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 5193 million and 6025 million respectively of which our proportionate share of such joint venture debt was 920 million and 1340 million respectively of our proportionate share of joint venture debt we provided limited recourse guaranties for 843 million and 1245 million of such joint venture debt at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k for additional information 

for 2008 2007 and 2006 we recognized equity loss from our unconsolidated joint ventures of 128 million 1900 million and 629 million respectively the equity loss recognized during 2008 2007 and 2006 includes land valuation adjustments of 185 million 1899 million and 954 million respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

homebuilding – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by sfas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed unless there is a loss on the sale in which case the loss on such sale is recognized at the time of closing 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  

financial services – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received or the subservicing fees are earned with the adoption of sfas 159 effective january 1 2008 loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred previously such fees and costs were deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related loans and recognized as an adjustment to revenues upon the sale of such loans gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan

inventory is stated at the lower of accumulated cost or fair value as determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets” “sfas 144” accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction for those communities for which construction and development activities have been idled applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred land acquisition and development costs are allocated to individual lots using an average lot cost determined based on the total expected land acquisition and development costs and the total expected home closings for the community the specific identification method is used to accumulate home construction costs 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated over the period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements 

cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home the average lot cost for the home estimated warranty costs for the home and commissions and closing costs applicable to the home the construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total community land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete the development cycles for our communities range from under one year to in excess of ten years for certain master planned communities adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the community affect the amounts costed for the community’s remaining lots 

in accordance with sfas 144 we record valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts for communities that demonstrate indicators of impairment we compare the expected undiscounted cash flows for these communities to their carrying value for those communities whose carrying values exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows we calculate the fair value of the community impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of the community’s inventory is less than its carrying value 

we generally determine the fair value of each community’s inventory using a discounted cash flow model these estimated cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates related to expected average selling prices and sale incentives expected sales paces and cancellation rates expected land development and construction timelines and anticipated land development construction and overhead costs such estimates must be made for each individual community and may vary significantly between communities due to uncertainties in the estimation process the significant volatility in demand for new housing and the long life cycles of many communities actual results could differ significantly from such estimates

investments in unconsolidated entities 

we have investments in a number of unconsolidated entities including joint ventures with independent third parties many of these unconsolidated entities purchase develop andor sell land and homes in the united states and puerto rico the equity method of accounting is used for unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence generally this represents partnership equity or common stock ownership interests of at least 20 and not more than 50 under the equity method of accounting we recognize our proportionate share of the profits and losses of these entities certain of these entities sell land to us in these situations we defer the recognition of profits from such activities until the time the related homes are sold the cost method of accounting is used for investments in which we have less than a 20 ownership interest and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 

we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for recoverability in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” “apb 18” if we determine that a loss in the value of the investment is other than temporary we write down the investment to its estimated fair value any such losses are recorded to equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations additionally each unconsolidated entity evaluates its longlived assets such as inventory for recoverability in accordance with sfas 144 our proportionate share of any such impairments under sfas 144 are also recorded to equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations evaluations of recoverability under both apb 18 and sfas 144 are primarily based on projected cash flows due to uncertainties in the estimation process and the significant volatility in demand for new housing actual results could differ significantly from such estimates 

residential mortgage loans 

prior to january 1 2008 residential mortgage loans availableforsale were stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value in accordance with sfas 159 we elected the fair value option for our portfolio loans availableforsale and for first mortgage loans originated subsequent to december 31 2007 sfas 159 permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contractbycontract basis election of the fair value option for residential mortgage loans availableforsale allows a better offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions changes in the fair value of these loans are reflected in revenues as they occur 

loans held for investment consist of interim financing mortgage loans for certain of our customers as well as a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing these loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill most of which relate to the del webb merger in 2001 intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure impairment using accepted valuation methods for intangible assets we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows for goodwill we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control as of december 31 2008 all of our recorded goodwill has been written off 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects including a oneyear comprehensive limited warranty and coverage for certain other aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for periods of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability for each geographic market in which we operate and adjust the amounts as necessary actual warranty costs in the future could differ from our estimates

insurance 

we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and related lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors including extended lag times in the reporting and resolution of claims which generally occur over several years and can occur in excess of ten years and trends or changes in claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations as a result actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs stockbased compensation 

we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective method of transition 

income taxes 

we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” effective january 1 2007 fin 48 creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions evaluations of our tax positions consider changes in facts or circumstances changes in law correspondence with taxing authorities and settlements of audit issues

 pulte mortgage operating as a mortgage banker is also subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreedupon terms ie commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2008 and 2007 this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

we minimize interest rate risk by i financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to libor and ii hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1 business 

pulte homes inc 

pulte homes inc is a publicly held holding company whose subsidiaries engage in the homebuilding and financial services businesses pulte homes inc is a michigan corporation and was organized in 1956 our assets consist principally of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and our income primarily consists of dividends from our subsidiaries our direct subsidiaries include pulte diversified companies inc del webb corporation “del webb” and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business pulte diversified companies inc’s operating subsidiaries include pulte home corporation pulte international corporation “international” and other subsidiaries engaged in the homebuilding business we also have a mortgage banking company pulte mortgage llc “pulte mortgage” which is a subsidiary of pulte home corporation 

during 2007 and 2006 the us housing market was impacted by a lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures during 2007 these conditions continued to deteriorate and were accompanied by increased foreclosure activity and constraints on the availability of certain mortgage financing products these factors contributed to weakened demand for new homes slower sales higher cancellation rates and increased price discounts and selling incentives to attract homebuyers compared with recent years when we had experienced record growth the combination of these homebuilding industry and related mortgage financing developments resulted in significant decreases in our revenues and profitability during 2007 

homebuilding our core business is engaged in the acquisition and development of land principally for residential purposes within the continental united states and puerto rico and the construction of housing on such land targeted for the firsttime first and second moveup and active adult home buyers we have determined our operating segments to be our areas which are aggregated into seven reportable segments based on similarities in the economic and geographic characteristics of our homebuilding operations accordingly our reportable homebuilding segments are as follows 

 

 

 our homebuilding operations located in reno nevada are reported in the california segment while our remaining nevada homebuilding operations are reported in the southwest segment 

we also have one reportable segment for our financial services operations which consists principally of mortgage banking and title operations conducted through pulte mortgage and our other subsidiaries our financial services segment operates generally in the same markets as our homebuilding segments

homebuilding operations 

 

through our brands which include pulte homes del webb and divosta we offer a wide variety of home designs including single family detached townhouses condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities to all of our major customer segments firsttime first and second moveup and active adult over our 58year history we have delivered over 500000 homes 

as of december 31 2007 our homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 636 communities sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 72 of our communities fall within the range of 100000 to 400000 with a 2007 average unit selling price of 322000 compared with 337000 in 2006 315000 in 2005 287000 in 2004 and 259000 in 2003 sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 74 in both 2007 and 2006 compared with 72 in 2005 80 in 2004 and 83 in 2003 the decline in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to an increase in sales of townhouses condominiums and duplexes which are most popular among our firsttime and active adult homebuyers our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result help to insulate us from demand changes in individual markets as of december 31 2007 our homebuilding business operated in 51 markets spanning 26 states 

land acquisition and development 

we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through the use of option contracts we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community buildout requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes as a result land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning and obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2007 we controlled approximately 157900 lots of which 131400 were owned and 26500 were under option agreements 

homebuilding operations continued 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer profiles segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group 

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features in certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which most features shown in the home are included in the sales price 

typically our sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including our customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the superintendent 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have success with the firsttime buyer in the low to moderate price range in such cases financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company we also enjoy sales to the moveup buyer and in certain markets offer semicustom homes in higher price ranges 

through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults among the fastest growing homebuying segments we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these communities with highly amenitized products such as golf courses recreational centers and educational classes offer the active adult buyer many options to maintain an active lifestyle 

we have received recognition and awards as a result of our achievements as a homebuilder in june 2007 pulte homes was named among the top 100 best places to work in it in computerworld’s annual rankings in april 2007 we ranked number 170 on the fortune 500 list in addition our albuquerque central valley chicago del webb ft myersnaples houston jacksonville laventura orlando palm beach divosta philadelphia del webb and tucson del webb operations were recognized for ranking the highest in their markets in the jd power and associates ® 2007 new homebuilder customer satisfaction study nine of our operations ranked second in their respective markets while six operations ranked third pulte brands which include pulte homes del webb and divosta were surveyed in 26 of the 34 total markets analyzed the survey noted customer service home readiness at the time of closing and the company’s sales staff as the three factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of satisfaction this year’s homebuilder rankings also included new studies which evaluated homebuyers’ satisfaction with newhome quality newhome design and builder mortgage origination pulte homes’ market operations earned top rankings for newhome quality in eight markets newhome design in nine markets and builder mortgage origination in three markets

homebuilding operations continued 

construction 

the construction process for our homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis in certain markets we provide a unique design and production process that is highly efficient and results in lower costs higher overall specification and increased value to our customers we believe that pulte preferred partnerships p 3  an extension of our quality assurance program continues to establish new standards for contractor relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes 

we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and when possible by building on contiguous lots to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives 

we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future and have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets 

competition and other factors 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration “fha” or veterans administration “va” mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is highly competitive in each of our market areas there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with the resales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units for sale or to rent including apartment builders may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in the costs of building materials and labor 3 changes in interest rates 4 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 5 various demographic factors 6 changes in federal income tax laws 7 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 8 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma fhlmc and private investors 

our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado and charlotte north carolina using a mortgage operations center “moc” concept we also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at mortgage application centers “mac” in denver and charlotte we believe both the moc and the mac improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers in 2007 we had a high level of utilization of our online customer questionnaire the majority of our customers now send us their data online to start the mortgage process once the questionnaire is received an interview is scheduled and the combination of the interview with the data sent online represents our mortgage application 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to outside investors 

our capture rates for 2007 2006 and 2005 were 92 91 and 89 respectively our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding business excluding cash settlements during 2007 2006 and 2005 we originated mortgage loans for 76 77 and 75 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented substantially all of our total originations in each of those years 

we sell our servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 days after sale or securitization 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to our homebuyers the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in selected markets by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell 

financial information about geographic areas

in december 2005 we sold substantially all of our mexico homebuilding operations to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development we realized cash of 1315 million related to the sale the sale of these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in mexico as well as various nonoperating entities which are not considered to be material to our results of operations or our financial position for 2007 2006 and 2005 the mexico homebuilding operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements

other nonoperating expenses net consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit’s management andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 8500 people of which approximately 2200 people were employed in our verticallyintegrated construction operations in our southwest reporting segment our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is based on the performance of the applicable business unit subsidiary or the company our corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our overall performance each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle which has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

prior to 2006 land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets however during 2007 and 2006 the homebuilding industry was impacted by lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories which resulted in an industrywide softening of demand for new homes as a result of these factors we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and profitability we have also incurred substantial impairments of our land and certain other assets we cannot predict the duration or the severity of the current market conditions nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to writedown our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

as a result of the changing market conditions in the homebuilding industry which occurred during 2007 and 2006 we incurred significant landrelated charges in 2007 and 2006 resulting from the writeoff of deposit and other related costs related to land transactions we no longer plan to pursue net realizable valuation adjustments related to land positions sold or held for sale impairments on land assets related to communities under development or to be developed in the future and impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures it is possible that the estimated cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation or net realizable adjustments additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for additional impairments or writedowns which could result in additional charges that might be significant 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build over the past few years we have experienced an increase in competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business and financial results 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank interest rates have been at historical lows for several years many homebuyers have also chosen adjustable rate interestonly or other types of mortgages that involve lower initial monthly payments as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business beginning in early 2007 the availability of certain mortgage financing products has become more constrained as the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime alta and other nonconforming mortgage products while we do not retain any material risks associated with the loans we originate our financial services business could be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ additionally these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations for our homebuilding business 

in addition we believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes we also believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market any limitations or restrictions on the availability of financing by these agencies could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

our future growth may require additional capital which may not be available 

our operations require significant amounts of cash we may be required to seek additional capital whether from sales of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings for the future growth and development of our business we can give no assurance as to the availability of such additional capital or if available whether it would be on terms acceptable to us moreover the indentures for most of our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving credit facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital it could reduce our sales and may adversely affect our future growth and financial results 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor lumber framing concrete steel and other building materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays the current national debate related to immigration reform could impact the related laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate and result in shortages of skilled labor and higher labor and compliance costs potentially affecting our ability to complete construction and land development we generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sale contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

our income tax provision and tax reserves may be insufficient if a taxing authority is successful in asserting positions that are contrary to our interpretations and related reserves if any 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our reserves for federal state and local taxes in the ordinary course of business there may be matters for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain although we believe our approach to determining the tax treatment is appropriate no assurance can be given that the final tax authority review will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision and related tax reserves such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and consequently on our net income for such period 

from time to time we are audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding tax matters our current audits are in various stages of completion however no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit appeal and in some cases litigation process as each audit is concluded adjustments if any are appropriately recorded in our financial statements in the period determined to provide for potential tax exposures we maintain tax reserves based on reasonable estimates of potential audit results however if the reserves are insufficient upon completion of an audit there could be an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 

the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon utilization of taxable income in prior carryback years generating future taxable income executing tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred income tax assets the valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change or if we are unable to implement certain tax planning strategies an increase in the valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred income tax assets and have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies these may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensations and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the united states could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

 item 3 legal proceedings

in april 2004 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us we have provided the epa with this information although the matter has since been referred to the united states department of justice “doj” for enforcement the epa has asked that we engage in “prefiling” negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation we are actively engaged in these negotiations if the negotiations fail and the doj alleges that we have violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges the government may seek injunctive relief and penalties we believe that we have defenses to any such allegations at this time however we can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we currently estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

during 2007 and 2006 the us housing market was impacted by a lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures during 2007 these conditions continued to deteriorate and were accompanied by increased foreclosure activity and constraints on the availability of certain mortgage financing products these factors contributed to weakened demand for new homes slower sales higher cancellation rates and increased price discounts and selling incentives to attract homebuyers compared with recent years when we had experienced record growth the combination of these homebuilding industry and related mortgage financing developments resulted in significant decreases in our revenues and profitability during 2007 additionally we incurred total landrelated charges of 2 billion and 4095 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively which represent significant increases from landrelated charges of 30 million in 2005 we also recorded impairments of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 1899 million and 954 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively and goodwill impairments of 370 million in 2007 

we continue to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term we expect these trends in our unit settlements and pricing to continue and the majority of the markets we serve to remain challenging throughout 2008 we have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and development and construction practices and continue to shorten our land pipeline limit land development expenditures reduce production volumes and balance home price and profitability with sales pace we are delaying planned land purchases and development spending and have significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option additionally we are significantly reducing the number of speculative homes put into production while we will continue to purchase select land positions where it makes strategic and economic sense to do so we currently anticipate minimal investment in new land parcels in the near term we have also closely evaluated and made significant reductions in employee headcount and overhead expenses in may 2007 we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve ongoing operating efficiencies which resulted in related charges of 457 million in 2007 given the persistence of these difficult market conditions improving the efficiency of our overhead costs will continue to be a significant area of focus we believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may develop in the future 

given the continued weakness in new home sales and closings visibility as to future earnings performance is limited our outlook is tempered with caution as conditions in many of the markets we serve across the united states have become increasingly challenging our evaluation for landrelated charges recorded to date assumed our best estimates of cash flows for the communities tested if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future or if our strategy related to certain communities changes we may be required to evaluate our assets including additional projects for additional impairments or writedowns which could result in additional charges that might be significant

the following is a comparison of pretax income loss for 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

homebuilding operations 

the following table presents a summary of pretax income loss for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 

 

 

 home sale revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 were lower than those for the prior year by approximately 51 billion or 36 unit settlements decreased 34 in 2007 to 27540 units compared with 2006 and increased 9 for 2006 to 41487 units compared with 2005 the average selling price for homes closed in 2007 2006 and 2005 was 322000 337000 and 315000 respectively the changes in average selling price reflect a combination of factors including changes in product mix and geographic mix of homes closed during the period as well as lower market selling prices the average selling price decreased in the majority of our homebuilding segments during 2007 

homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2007 were negative 5 compared with positive 174 in 2006 in 2006 homebuilding gross profit margins decreased 600 basis points from 234 in 2005 the significant decreases in gross profit margins that commenced in 2006 and continued into 2007 were attributable to the difficult market conditions and challenging sales environment where we have realized lower average selling prices and increased sales incentives related to homes closed during the year in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 we recorded land and community valuation adjustments of 16 billion and 2038 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively which included capitalized interest of 1108 million and 16 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively there were no significant valuation adjustments recorded during the year ended december 31 2005 

homebuilding operations continued 

we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments we also will on occasion sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders gross profit from land sales had negative margin contributions of 178 million and 387 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively compared with a positive margin contribution of 182 million for 2005 land sale revenues and their related gainslosses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of land sales we continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital land held for disposition was 2526 million as of december 31 2007 compared with 4658 million at december 31 2006 during 2007 and 2006 we recorded net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of 1992 and 546 million respectively there were no significant net realizable value adjustments in 2005 

for the year ended december 31 2007 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues increased 380 basis points to 119 compared with 2006 after increasing 40 basis points to 81 in 2006 compared with 2005 these increases are attributable primarily to reduced overhead leverage as a result of the significant decrease in revenues lower absorption into inventory of overhead costs due to lower construction volume net increases in insurance related expenses of 577 million and 155 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively and employee severance benefits including 32 million of severance benefits related to the restructuring plan initiated in may 2007 

equity loss was 1904 million and 952 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively compared with equity income of 726 million for 2005 the equity losses experienced for 2007 and 2006 included impairments related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 1899 million and 954 million respectively additionally the decrease in 2006 equity income compared with the prior year is also the result of our january 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems as a result of this acquisition we own 100 of this entity which is consolidated in our financial statements in 2005 earnings for this investment were recorded in equity income in addition earnings from our 50 investment in a nevadabased joint venture related to the sale of commercial and residential properties decreased in 2006 as the venture substantially completed its operations in 2005 

other income expense net includes the writeoff of deposits and other related costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options insurancerelated expenses and settlements and other nonoperating expenses the changes in other income expense net are due in part to writeoffs of deposit and other related costs during 2007 2006 and 2005 of 2397 million 1512 million and 192 million respectively these writeoffs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital other income expense net also includes goodwill impairment charges of 370 million in 2007 and charges of 23 million and 185 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively related to the closure of a production facility located in virginia

for 2007 northeast home sale revenues decreased 33 compared with the prior year period due to a 26 decrease in unit settlements combined with an 8 decrease in the average selling price including significant home sale revenue reductions in our metro new york market the loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and 1933 million in impairments and landrelated charges which resulted in a reduction of approximately 12800 lots under control northeast recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 592 million in 2006 net new orders decreased 13 compared with 2006 while the cancellation rate increased to 24 compared with 22 in 2006

southeast 

our southeast segment continued to contribute positively to operating results in 2007 due to strength in local demographic factors and a continued shift in our product mix toward higher price point customers especially active adult buyers as large active adult communities were opened in our markets in georgia and the carolinas at various points during 2006 and 2007 for 2007 southeast home sale revenues decreased 6 compared with the prior year period as an 11 decrease in unit settlements was offset by a 6 increase in the average selling price income before income taxes decreased compared with the prior year period due to 269 million in impairments and landrelated charges which resulted in a reduction of approximately 4700 lots under control southeast recorded landrelated charges of 56 million in 2006 net new orders declined by 23 compared with 2006 partially due to 2006 including new orders from the successful openings of our large active adult communities in our charlotte raleigh and georgia markets the cancellation rate in 2007 was 28 compared with 24 in 2006 

for 2006 southeast operations contributed positively to our homebuilding operating results evidenced by increased revenues and unit settlements as well as higher average selling prices and profits compared with prior year periods the increases in the southeast’s profitability were attributable to a continued shift in product mix toward the active adult homebuyer additionally we opened a new large active adult community in charlotte during 2006 southeast home sale revenues increased 32 compared with 2005 due to a 9 increase in unit settlements combined with a 21 increase in the average selling price our southeast operations recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 56 million in 2006 there were no significant impairments or landrelated charges recorded in 2005 net new orders in 2006 decreased 5 compared with 2005 the reduction in new orders during 2006 contributed to the increase in cancellation rates cancellation rates for 2006 were 24 compared with 18 for 2005

florida  

our florida segment continues to be challenged due to the combination of a significant decrease in demand combined with high levels of new and existing home inventories especially in the southern portion of the state for 2007 florida home sale revenues decreased 51 compared with the prior year period due to a 46 decrease in unit settlements combined with a 9 decrease in the average selling price including significant home sale revenue reductions in our orlando and southwest florida markets the loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and 3583 million in impairments and landrelated charges which resulted in a reduction of approximately 7700 lots under control florida recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 534 million in 2006 net new orders declined by 10 due to the difficult market conditions cancellation rates for 2007 were 30 which was comparable to the 2006 cancellation rate of 31 

during 2006 our florida operations experienced weakened demand largely attributable to increased existing home inventories especially in orlando and naplesft myers florida experienced high cancellation rates and pricing pressures associated with excess inventories and aggressive sales incentives offered by competitors florida’s home sale revenues decreased 2 compared with 2005 as a 16 decrease in unit settlements was offset by a 17 increase in average selling price during 2006 we recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 534 million there were no significant impairments and landrelated charges recorded in 2005 net new orders for 2006 decreased 46 compared with 2005 for 2006 increased cancellation rates were attributable to lower new order signup activity and increased cancellations in all florida markets for 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 31 compared with 12 for 2005 

midwest

central 

for 2007 central home sale revenues decreased 36 compared with the prior year period due to a 46 decrease in unit settlements as all of our central markets experienced home sale revenue reductions this lower unit volume was partially offset by an 18 increase in average selling prices the loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues and 1221 million in impairments and landrelated charges which resulted in a reduction of approximately 1400 lots under control central recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 159 million in 2006 net new orders declined by 45 due to the difficult market conditions for 2007 cancellation rates were approximately 34 compared with 30 for 2006

in 2006 the southwest operations contributed positively to our homebuilding operating results evidenced by increased revenues unit settlements and higher average selling prices compared with 2005 southwest home sale revenue increased 13 in 2006 due to a 3 increase in unit settlements combined with a 10 increase in average selling price however during 2006 our southwest operations recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 378 million there were no significant impairments or landrelated charges recorded in 2005 operating results for the southwest segment were positively impacted by our january 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems in both arizona and nevada during 2005 income from this entity was recorded as equity income and had no impact on segment pretax income net new orders for 2006 decreased 22 compared with 2005 during 2006 reduced new order signup activity resulted in higher cancellation rates for 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 35 compared with 16 for 2005 

california 

our california operations have been impacted by significantly weakened demand for new homes affordability issues and an excess supply of resale inventory in substantially all of our markets for 2007 california home sale revenues decreased 44 compared with the prior year period due to a 40 decrease in unit settlements combined with an 8 decrease in average selling prices as a majority of our california markets experienced home sale revenue reductions the loss before income taxes was primarily attributable to this reduction in revenues combined with a significant decline in gross margin and 4681 million in impairments and landrelated charges which resulted in a reduction of approximately 6900 lots under control also included in california’s results for 2007 is an impairment of 1283 million related to unconsolidated joint ventures in 2006 california recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 89 million and a 954 million valuation adjustment related to two of our unconsolidated joint ventures located in sacramento net new orders declined by 31 in 2007 due to the difficult market conditions cancellation rates were approximately 43 for 2007 compared with 36 for 2006 

the california segment was impacted in 2006 by weakened demand for new homes evidenced by increased resale inventories and pricing pressures especially in sacramento california home sale revenues decreased 18 in 2006 due primarily to a 17 decrease in unit settlements average selling prices remained consistent with 2005 in 2006 california recorded impairments and landrelated charges of 89 million and a 954 million valuation adjustment related to two of our unconsolidated joint ventures located in sacramento there were no significant impairments or landrelated charges recorded in 2005 during 2006 reduced new order signup activity resulted in higher cancellation rates net new orders for 2006 decreased 32 compared with 2005 for 2006 cancellation rates were approximately 36 compared with 24 for 2005 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries we originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans monthly to outside investors also we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held we do not amortize the servicing asset since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts there are no impairment issues related to these assets 

the following table presents selected financial information for our financial services operations 000’s omitted 

 

mortgage origination unit volume and principal volume decreased 42 and 39 respectively in 2007 compared with 2006 the decreases in unit and principal volume are due primarily to lower home settlements in 2007 compared with 2006 this factor was partially offset by an increase in the capture rate to 92 in 2007 from 91 in 2006 as well as a higher average loan size during 2006 mortgage origination unit volume decreased 6 while mortgage origination principal volume increased 2 compared with 2005 the decrease in unit volume is attributable to lower home settlements offset by a higher capture rate in 2006 91 compared with 2005 89 while the increase in origination principal volume is attributable to a higher average loan size our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding operations as a percentage of total loan opportunities from our homebuilding operations excluding cash settlements our homebuilding customers continue to account for substantially all loan production representing nearly 100 of pulte mortgage unit production for 2007 and 2006 compared with 98 in 2005 

the mortgage industry experienced a significant shift away from adjustable rate mortgages arms to fixed rate mortgages during 2007 and 2006 arms which generally have a lower profit per loan than fixed rate products represented 8 of total funded origination dollars and 6 of total funded origination units in 2007 compared with 28 and 22 respectively in 2006 and 45 and 39 respectively in 2005 interestonly mortgages a component of arms represented 74 of arms origination dollars and 72 of arms origination units in 2007 compared with 79 and 81 respectively in 2006 and 65 and 56 respectively in 2005 as a result interestonly mortgages represented 6 22 and 29 of total funded origination dollars in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

financial services operations continued 

our customers’ average fico scores for 2007 2006 and 2005 were 745 743 and 741 respectively average combined loantovalue was 82 for both 2007 and 2006 and 81 for 2005 at december 31 2007 our loan application backlog was 15 billion compared with 21 billion and 42 billion at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

based on principal dollars approximately 4 of the loans we originated during 2007 were considered subprime loans which we define as first mortgages with fico scores below 620 approximately 14 of 2007 originations were considered alta loans which we define as nonfull documentation first mortgages with fico scores of 620 or higher the remaining 82 of 2007 originations were prime loans which we define as full documentation first mortgages with fico scores of 620 or higher because we sell our loans monthly and retain only limited risk for sold loans for a short period of time we believe that our financial services operations do not have any material direct risks related to subprime and alta loans however the availability of certain mortgage financing products has become more constrained in 2007 as the mortgage industry is now more closely scrutinizing subprime alta and other nonconforming mortgage products these developments have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the overall demand for new housing and thereby on the results of operations of both our homebuilding and financial services businesses 

pretax income decreased 63 in 2007 compared with 2006 during 2006 we sold our investment in su casita a mexicobased mortgage banking company as a result of this transaction we recognized a pretax gain of approximately 316 million in 2006 excluding this gain pretax income decreased significantly in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to lower originations and increased loan loss reserves this decrease was partially offset by an increase in average loan size and the shift in funded product mix toward fixed rate and agency loans which are more profitable for us the percentage of total origination dollars from brokered loans which are funded by third party lenders and are therefore less profitable to us was comparable in 2007 and 2006 

pretax income increased 64 in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to the sale of our investment in su casita excluding this gain pretax income increased in 2006 compared with 2005 due to the combination of increased origination principal volume and a shift in product mix to more profitable loans including a small decline in the mix from brokered loans 

interest income in 2007 was 35 lower than in 2006 primarily due to the significant decrease in loan origination volume offset slightly by higher loan yields for 2006 interest income increased 29 compared with 2005 due to the increase in funded origination volume combined with higher loan yields revenues from our title operations decreased 30 in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the decline in loan origination volume and stayed fairly even in 2006 compared with 2005 based on the lack of significant change in origination principal volume expenses decreased significantly in 2007 due to the decrease in volume and reduced headcount offset by higher loan loss reserves and less leverage of our fixed operating costs 

since we sell the majority of our loans monthly and retain only limited risk related to the loans we originate our overall loan loss reserves have historically not been significant during 2007 however we experienced increases in our loans held for investment nonperforming portfolio loans and foreclosed properties as well as higher expected losses on repurchased loans as a result our overall loan loss reserves increased to 117 million at december 31 2007 compared with 17 million at december 31 2006 

we hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

other nonoperating 

other nonoperating expenses consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange accordingly these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve 

the following table presents results of operations 000’s omitted 

 

our higher invested cash balances during 2007 resulted in interest income in excess of amounts expensed compared with net interest expense in 2006 the decrease in net interest expense in 2006 compared with 2005 was the result of an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory changes in other expenses net for 2007 and 2006 compared with 2005 were primarily due to reductions in compensationrelated costs 

interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities interest expensed to homebuilding cost of sales for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 includes 1108 and 16 million respectively related to land and community valuation adjustments information related to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows 000’s omitted 

 

 

 income taxes 

our income tax assets and liabilities and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors income taxes were provided at an effective tax rate of 89 363 and 369 for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than in prior years primarily due to a 6219 million noncash deferred tax valuation allowance excluding the valuation allowance and goodwill impairment charges the effective tax rate would have been approximately 38 for 2007 

discontinued operations 

first heights 

in 2005 we completed the disposal of first heights our former bank subsidiary during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 aftertax income was 189 thousand and 565 million respectively and is included in income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2005 includes 78 million related to the recognition of income tax benefits resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters we also received payment in december 2005 of a 487 million judgment resulting from litigation related to first heights’ 1988 acquisition from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation and first heights’ ownership of five failed thrifts the payment was recorded as income from discontinued operations 

mexico homebuilding operations 

in january 2005 the minority shareholders of pulte mexico s de rl de cv “pulte mexico” exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of december 31 2001 to sell their shares to us the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100 of pulte mexico in march 2005 we purchased 60 of the minority interest of pulte mexico for approximately 187 million in cash in june 2005 we purchased the remaining 40 of the minority interest of pulte mexico for approximately 125 million in cash 

in december 2005 we sold substantially all of our mexico homebuilding operations to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development we realized cash of 1315 million related to the sale the sale of these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in mexico as well as various nonoperating entities which are not considered to be material to the company’s results of operations or its financial position 

for 2007 2006 and 2005 the mexico homebuilding operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2007 income from discontinued operations represents 187 million in refundable income taxes related to our investment in our discontinued mexico homebuilding operations 

argentina operations

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our homebuilding land acquisitions development and construction activities by using internallygenerated funds and existing credit arrangements we routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financing sources including securities offerings based on our current financial condition and credit relationships we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and longterm capital requirements however we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are necessary if market conditions continue to deteriorate or if the current difficult market conditions extend beyond our expectations 

at december 31 2007 we had cash and equivalents of 11 billion and 35 billion of senior notes outstanding other financing included nonrecourse collateralized financing totaling 94 million sources of our working capital include our cash and equivalents our committed unsecured revolving credit facility and pulte mortgage’s committed credit arrangements 

our ratio of debttototal capitalization excluding our landcollateralized and pulte mortgage debt was 446 at december 31 2007 and approximately 359 net of cash and equivalents 

we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility twice during 2007 decreasing the borrowing capacity from 201 billion to 186 billion and extending the maturity date from october 2010 to june 2012 in february 2008 we amended the credit facility again and decreased the borrowing capacity to 16 billion under the terms of the credit facility we have the capacity to issue letters of credit totaling up to 1125 billion borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding the credit facility includes a borrowing base limitation when we do not have an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from at least two of fitch ratings moody’s investor service and standard and poor’s corporation under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on the revolving credit facility may not exceed an amount based on certain percentages of various categories of our unencumbered inventory and other assets 

liquidity and capital resources continued 

the credit facility contains certain financial covenants we are required to not exceed a debttototal capitalization ratio of 55 and we are required to meet a tangible net worth minimum each quarter at december 31 2007 our debttototal capitalization ratio as defined in the credit facility was 426 while our tangible net worth as defined in the credit facility cushion was 8185 million after giving effect to the february 2008 amendment in the event market conditions deteriorate in the future and result in additional significant landrelated charges our tangible net worth may come close to or fall below the required minimum violations of any of the covenants in the credit facility if not cured or waived by the lenders could result in an optional maturity date acceleration by the lenders in the event this were to occur we would seek to replace the financing provided by the credit facility the credit facility no longer contains an interest coverage ratio covenant that could create an event of default for us but if the interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility is less than 2 to 1 libor margin and letter of credit pricing under the credit facility can increase in increments ranging from 0125 to 0375 and the debttototal capitalization ratio covenant threshold can decrease in increments of 25 the credit facility’s uncommitted accordion feature remains unchanged at 225 billion as of december 31 2007 we had no borrowings outstanding and 141 billion available for borrowing under this facility 

pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements at december 31 2007 pulte mortgage had committed credit arrangements of 705 million comprised of a 405 million bank revolving credit facility and a 300 million assetbacked commercial paper program due to the reduced loan origination volume and unfavorable changes in the assetbacked commercial paper market pulte mortgage amended its commercial paper program twice during 2007 which among other things reduced the capacity from 550 million to the 300 million available at december 31 2007 in february 2008 pulte mortgage further amended the commercial paper program to reduce the capacity to 150 million after giving effect to the most recent amendment pulte mortgage has committed credit arrangements of 555 million comprised of a 405 million bank revolving credit facility and a 150 million commercial paper program the credit agreements require pulte mortgage to maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of at least 50 million or eightyfive percent of the average monthend tangible net worth for the last twelve months of the preceding calendar year 528 million for 2008 and funded debt cannot exceed 15 times tangible net worth pulte mortgage had 4406 million outstanding under its committed credit arrangements at december 31 2007 

we have experienced downgrades in our credit ratings during 2007 by each of the major credit rating agencies while such downgrades do not directly impact our senior notes they could increase the cost of borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility and limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms in the event of additional downgrades the lenders under pulte mortgage’s assetbacked commercial paper program may have the right at their discretion to require early repayment of outstanding balances or place other restrictions on our ability to utilize the assetbacked commercial paper program in the event of such an occurrence we believe we have capacity through other sources to meet pulte mortgage’s anticipated financing needs 

our net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 amounted to 12 billion while net cash used in operating activities was 2675 million in 2006 for 2005 net cash provided by operating activities was 187 million the primary drivers of cash flow from operations are profitability and investments in inventory in 2007 the net loss was largely attributable to noncash asset impairments including landrelated charges impairments of goodwill and investments in unconsolidated entities and a deferred tax valuation allowance in addition we significantly reduced our investments in land inventory in light of the challenging conditions in the homebuilding industry in 2006 the reduced profitability compared with 2005 was coupled with significant investments in land inventory in 2005 net income was offset primarily by significant investments in land inventory 

cash used in investing activities was 2214 million in 2007 compared with 867 million in 2006 and 253 million in 2005 the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2007 compared with 2006 resulted primarily from investments of 2175 million in unconsolidated entities the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared with 2005 resulted primarily from the use of 658 million net of cash acquired to purchase the remaining 50 of an entity that installs basic building components and operating systems in addition we received cash of 492 million in 2006 for the sale of subsidiaries and equity investments primarily resulting from the sale of our mexico homebuilding operations 

liquidity and capital resources continued 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 4876 million and 962 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively compared with net cash provided by financing activities of 7004 million in 2005 the cash used in financing activities in 2007 and 2006 were largely attributable to reductions in outstanding borrowings under various credit arrangements as the result of the lower volumes in our homebuilding and financial services operations offsetting this to some degree in 2007 was a significant reduction in stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs the cash provided by financing activities in 2005 resulted primarily from increased borrowings under our pulte mortgage credit arrangements to fund the increase in funded loan originations and the issuance of 650 million in senior notes to help fund additional investments in land inventory 

pursuant to the two 100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october 2002 and 2005 and the 200 million stock repurchase authorization in february 2006 for a total stock repurchase authorization of 400 million we have repurchased a total of 9688900 shares for a total of 2977 million there were no repurchases under these programs during 2007 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 1023 million at december 31 2007

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation may also increase our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers while we attempt to pass to our customers increases in our costs through increased sales prices the current industry conditions have resulted in lower sales prices in many of our markets if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly affecting our prospective homebuyers’ ability to adequately finance home purchases our revenues gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 

seasonality 

we experience variability in our quarterly results from operations due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry historically we have experienced significant increases in revenues and cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter based on the timing of home settlements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them this reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2007 we had agreements to acquire approximately 26500 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments at december 31 2007 we had 2225 million of nonrefundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements 

we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions we are also subject to income tax in certain foreign jurisdictions related to operations previously sold or discontinued as of december 31 2007 we had 862 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits and 211 million and 121 million of related accrued interest and penalties respectively we are currently under examination by various taxing jurisdictions and anticipate finalizing the examinations with certain jurisdictions within the next twelve months however the final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 19982006 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2007

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2007 we had outstanding letters of credit of 4936 million performance bonds and surety bonds do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 15 billion at december 31 2007 are typically outstanding over a period of approximately 35 years we do not believe that there will be draws upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2007 these agreements totaled approximately 16 billion pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity at december 31 2007 we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling 208 million 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 6025 million and 9359 million respectively at december 31 2007 and 2006 our proportionate share of joint venture debt was approximately 134 million and 3128 million respectively at december 31 2007 and 2006 we provided nonrecourse debt guarantees for 1245 million and 3041 million respectively of joint venture debt in the case of most joint ventures we have agreed to indemnify the joint venture’s lenders for certain environmental contingencies and most guarantee arrangements provide that we are responsible for our proportionate share of the outstanding debt if the joint venture voluntarily files for bankruptcy we would not be responsible under these guarantees unless the joint venture was unable to meet its contractual borrowing obligations or in instances of fraud misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by us 

for 2007 2006 and 2005 we recognized equity income loss from our unconsolidated joint ventures of 190 million 629 million and 754 million respectively the equity loss recognized during 2007 and 2006 includes land valuation adjustments of 1899 million and 954 million respectively which relate to certain of our joint ventures located in our california and southwest reportable segments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

  homebuilding – homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by sfas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  financial services – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing arrangements and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory valuation 

inventories are stated at accumulated cost unless certain facts indicate such cost would not be recovered from the cash flows generated by future disposition in this instance such inventories are measured at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets” sfas 144 accumulated cost includes costs associated with land acquisition land development and home construction costs including interest real estate taxes and certain direct and indirect overhead costs related to development and construction 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements 

sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis under the specific identification basis cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home an average lot cost based on expected land acquisition and development costs for the project as well as closing costs and commissions applicable to the home construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an appropriate accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared with the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared with actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete adjustments to estimated total land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amounts costed for the project’s remaining lots 

residential mortgage loans 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold we hedge our residential mortgage loans availableforsale gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans 

loans held for investment consist of interim financing mortgage loans for certain of our customers as well as a portfolio of loans that either have been repurchased from investors or were not saleable upon closing these loans are carried at cost and reviewed for impairment when recoverability becomes doubtful 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill most of which relate to the del webb merger in 2001 intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure impairment based on several accepted valuation methods for assets related to ongoing operations we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows for assets to be disposed of we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets for goodwill we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate 

insurance 

we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 

we are also selfinsured for certain of our medical and dental claims and reserve for costs to cover our liability for such claims based on analysis of historical claims which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 

stockbased compensation 

on january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” which is a revision of sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and amends sfas statement no 95 “statement of cash flows” we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited the company adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective method of transition accordingly prior periods have not been restated the adoption of sfas 123r did not have a significant effect on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2006 

prior to january 1 2006 the company accounted for its stockbased awards under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” the company selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” under the prospective method the company recognized compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 

income taxes 

the company calculates its provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or carryback to prior tax years in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financing to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2007 and 2006 our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair value 000’s omitted 

 

 

pulte mortgage operating as a mortgage banker is also subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreedupon terms ie commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2007 and 2006 this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

we minimize interest rate risk by i financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to libor and a1p1 commercial paper rates and ii hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of plus 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results 

at december 31 2007 our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining nonoperating investments in mexico which approximated 5 million

as of december 31 2006 our homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 690 communities sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 70 of our communities fall within the range of 100000 to 400000 with a 2006 average unit selling price of 337000 compared with 315000 in 2005 287000 in 2004 259000 in 2003 and 242000 in 2002 sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 74 in 2006 compared with 72 in 2005 80 in 2004 83 in 2003 and 86 in 2002 the decline in the percentage of singlefamily detached homes can be attributed to an increase in sales of townhouses condominiums and duplexes which are most popular among our firsttime and active adult homebuyers our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result better insulate us from demand changes in individual markets as of december 31 2006 our homebuilding business operated in 52 markets spanning 27 states 

land acquisition and development 

we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community build out requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes as a result land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2006 we controlled approximately 232200 lots of which 158800 were owned and 73400 were under option agreements

the construction process for our homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis in certain markets we provide a unique design and production process that is highly efficient and results in lower costs higher overall specification and increased value to our customers we believe that pulte preferred partnerships p 3  an extension of our quality assurance program continues to establish new standards for contractor relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes 

we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and when possible by building on contiguous lots to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives 

we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future and have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets 

competition and other factors 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration “fha” or veterans administration “va” mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is highly competitive in each of our market areas there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with the resales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units forsale or to rent including apartment builders may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in the costs of building materials and labor 3 changes in interest rates 4 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 5 various demographic factors 6 changes in federal income tax laws 7 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 8 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma fhlmc and private investors 

our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado and charlotte north carolina using a mortgage operations center “moc” concept we also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at mortgage application centers “mac” in denver and charlotte in addition during 2006 we initiated a web application program in certain markets once the loan applications are received our sales representatives who are the mortgage customers’ main contact forward them to a mac loan counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the moc for processing we believe both the moc and the mac improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

financial services operations continued 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to outside investors 

our capture rate for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was approximately 91 89 and 88 respectively our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we originated mortgage loans for approximately 77 75 and 72 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented nearly 100 98 and 92 respectively of our total originations during 2006 21 of total origination dollars were from brokered loans which are less profitable to us compared with 26 and 36 in 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in brokered loans can be attributed to a shift in product mix towards funded production 

we sell our servicing rights monthly on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 days after sale or securitization 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our homebuyers and to the general public the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

our subsidiary title insurance companies serve as title insurance agents in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to buyers of homes we sell 

financial information about geographic areas 

we currently operate primarily within the united states however we have some nonoperating foreign entities which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

discontinued operations 

mexico homebuilding operations 

in january 2005 the minority shareholders of pulte mexico s de rl de cv “pulte mexico” exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of december 31 2001 to sell their shares to us the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100 of pulte mexico in march 2005 we purchased 60 of the minority interest of pulte mexico for approximately 187 million in cash in june 2005 we purchased the remaining 40 of the minority interest of pulte mexico for approximately 125 million in cash 

in december 2005 we sold substantially all of our mexico homebuilding operations to a consortium of purchasers involved in residential and commercial real estate development the disposition of the mexico homebuilding operations will enable us to invest additional resources in the us housing market we realized cash of 1315 million related to the sale the sale of these operations did not include our investment in the capital stock of a mortgage company in mexico as well as various nonoperating entities for the year ended december 31 2005 we recognized a pretax loss of 66 million aftertax loss of 131 million related to the sale of our mexico homebuilding operations for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 the mexico homebuilding operations have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 

discontinued operations continued 

argentina 

in january 2005 we sold all of our argentina operations to an argentine company involved in residential and commercial real estate development for the year ended december 31 2004 the argentina operations are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 

first heights 

during the first quarter of 1994 we adopted a plan of disposal for first heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related mortgage banking first heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers the sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994 although we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time contractual disputes precluded us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan 

in august 2005 the united states court of appeals affirmed the united states court of federal claims final judgment that we had been damaged by approximately 487 million as a result of the united states government’s breach of contract in connection with the enactment of section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 in december 2005 we received payment of the judgment in the amount of 487 million which was recorded as income from discontinued operations 

in september 2005 first heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of the first heights bank the office of thrift supervision also canceled first heights’ charter accordingly the daytoday activities of first heights which had been principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the united states government have now ceased 

other nonoperating 

other nonoperating is comprised primarily of pulte homes inc and pulte diversified companies inc both of which are holding companies the primary purpose of these entities is to support the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered around new business development and operating efficiencies business development activities include the pursuit of additional opportunities as well as the development of innovative building components and processes other nonoperating also includes the activities associated with supporting a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange 

other nonoperating assets include equity investments in subsidiaries shortterm financial instruments and affiliate advances liabilities include senior debt and income taxes other nonoperating revenues consist primarily of investment earnings of excess funds while expenses include costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its subsidiaries’ operations and investigating strategic initiatives 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2006 we employed approximately 12400 people our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is based on the performance of the applicable business unit subsidiary or the company our corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our overall performance each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings and would adversely affect our financial condition 

the homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an economic down cycle which has resulted in the overvaluation of land and new homes in certain markets 

in recent years land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets however during the year ended december 31 2006 the homebuilding industry was impacted by lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories which resulted in an industrywide softening of demand for new homes as a result of these factors we are experiencing slower sales and higher cancellations which have impacted most of our markets and therefore we are making greater use of sales incentives we cannot predict the duration or the severity of the current market conditions nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

if the market value of our land and homes drops significantly our profits could decrease 

the market value of land building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions and the measures we employ to manage inventory risk may not be adequate to insulate our operations from a severe drop in inventory values we acquire land for expansion into new markets and for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current markets if housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past we may experience less than anticipated profits andor we may not be able to recover our costs when we sell and build homes when market conditions are such that land values are not appreciating option arrangements previously entered into may become less desirable at which time we may elect to forego deposits and preacquisition costs and terminate the agreement in the face of adverse market conditions we may have substantial inventory carrying costs we may have to writedown our inventory to its fair value andor we may have to sell land or homes at a loss 

as a result of the changing market conditions in the real estate industry which occurred during the year ended december 31 2006 our land inventories and communities under development demonstrated impairment indicators which were evaluated for potential impairment consequently we recorded land and community valuation adjustments of 2038 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair values and we also recorded 954 million of land and community valuation adjustments related to our unconsolidated joint ventures in addition we recorded 546 million of net realizable value adjustments to land held for sale and 1512 million for the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs for land option contracts we no longer plan to pursue it is possible that the estimated cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record additional valuation or net realizable adjustments additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future we may be required to evaluate additional projects for potential impairment which may result in additional valuation and net realizable value adjustments which could be significant 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices and zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build over the past few years we have experienced an increase in competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or our financial results 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank interest rates have been at historical lows for several years many homebuyers have also chosen adjustable rate interest only or mortgages that involve initial lower monthly payments as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ 

in addition we believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes we also believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market however the federal government has recently sought to reduce the size of the homeloan portfolios and operations of these two governmentsponsored enterprises any limitations or restrictions on the availability of the financing or on the liquidity by them could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

our future growth may require additional capital which may not be available 

our operations require significant amounts of cash we may be required to seek additional capital whether from sales of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings for the future growth and development of our business we can give no assurance as to the availability of such additional capital or if available whether it would be on terms acceptable to us moreover the indentures for most of our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving credit facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital it could reduce our sales and may adversely affect our future growth and financial results 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing used or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor lumber framing concrete steel and other building materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays the current national debate related to immigration reform could impact the related laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate and result in shortages of skilled labor and higher labor and compliance costs potentially affecting our ability to complete construction and land development we generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sale contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies these may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensations and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the united states could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

storm water discharge practices 

in july 2006 one of our 50owned unconsolidated joint ventures located in northern california received a civil liability complaint from the central valley regional water quality control board pursuant to the clean water act and sections 13376 and 13385 of the california water code the complaint sought information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by our joint venture our joint venture entered into settlement negotiations with the regional board to resolve this matter the final settlement imposes an administrative civil liability of 200000 and requires the completion of a supplemental environmental project sep at a cost of not less than 500000 as of december 31 2006 our joint venture has accrued for costs associated with the resolution of this matter accordingly we have recorded our 50 proportionate share of the joint venture loss at december 31 2006 

in april 2004 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us we have provided the epa with this information although the matter has since been referred to the united states department of justice “doj” for enforcement the epa has asked that we engage in “prefiling” negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation we are actively engaged in these negotiations if the negotiations fail and the doj alleges that we have violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges the government may seek injunctive relief and penalties we believe that we have defenses to any such allegations at this time however we can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we currently estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

during the year ended december 31 2006 the us housing market was impacted by a lack of consumer confidence decreased housing affordability and large supplies of resale and new home inventories and related pricing pressures these factors contributed to weakened demand for new homes slower sales higher cancellation rates and increased price discounts and selling incentives to attract homebuyers compared with the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 when we had experienced record growth in our homebuilding operations as a result gross margins recorded during the year ended december 31 2006 decreased from the same periods in the prior years from time to time we writeoff deposit and preacquisiton costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue as a result of changing market conditions during the year ended december 31 2006 we wroteoff deposit and preacquisition costs of 1512 million related to land transactions we no longer plan to pursue additionally during the year ended december 31 2006 we recorded land valuation and net realizable value adjustments of 3538 million including our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value our evaluation for these adjustments assumed our best estimate of cash flows for the communities tested if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future we may be required to evaluate for additional impairment resulting in additional impairment charges that could be significant 

we continue to operate our business with the expectation that these difficult market conditions will continue to impact us for at least the near term we have adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices continuing to shorten our land pipeline reduce production volumes and balance home price and profitability with sales pace we are slowing down planned land purchases and reducing our total number of controlled lots owned and under option additionally we are reducing the number of spec homes put into production however we continue to purchase select land positions where it makes economic and strategic sense to do so we believe that these measures will help to strengthen our market position and allow us to take advantage of opportunities that will develop in the future 

the following is a summary of our operating results for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 000’s omitted

homebuilding operations 

the following table presents a summary of pretax income for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 

 

 

 home sale revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 were lower than those for the prior year by approximately 395 million or 3 the decrease in homebuilding revenues was attributable to a 9 decrease in the number of homes closed to 41487 partially offset by a 7 increase in the average selling price of homes delivered to 337000 the increase in average selling price reflects a combination of changes in product mix and geographic mix of homes closed during the year ended december 31 2006 home sale revenues set a record for the year ended december 31 2005 at 45630 units an increase of 18 over the same period in 2004 while the 2005 average selling price for our homes increased 10 to 315000 compared with 2004 

homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2006 decreased 600 basis points from 2005 to 174 and in 2005 increased 80 basis points to 234 compared with 2004 the increase in homebuilding gross profit margins in 2005 is due to strong consumer demand positive home pricing favorable shifts in product and geographic mix the benefits of leveragebuy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management during the fourth quarter of 2006 homebuilding gross profit margins were 110 compared with 223 and 227 in the same periods of 2005 and 2004 respectively the significant decrease in gross profit margins during 2006 is attributable to the difficult market conditions and challenging sales environment where we have realized increased sales incentives and increased material and labor costs related to homes closed during the year additionally during 2006 we identified communities under development that demonstrated potential impairment indicators which were evaluated for potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas 144 consequently during the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2006 we recorded respective land valuation adjustments of 146 million and 2038 million which included capitalized interest of 16 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value there were no significant land valuation adjustments recorded during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004

we consider land acquisition and development to be one of our core competencies we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments we also will on occasion sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders gross profit loss from land sales was 387 million 182 million and 998 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively revenues and their related gainslosses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of land sales we continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital land held for disposition was approximately 4658 million as of december 31 2006 compared with 2577 million and 2301 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively during the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2006 we recorded net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale of 258 million and 546 million respectively there were no significant net realizable value adjustments for land held for sale during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 

for the year ended december 31 2006 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues increased 40 basis points to 81 compared with 2005 after decreasing 110 basis points to 77 in 2005 compared with 2004 the decreased conversion in 2006 compared with the prior year was the result of lower home sale revenues offset by our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs in the current business environment the conversion improvement in 2005 compared with 2004 can be attributed to an increase in average selling prices our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and better overhead leverage as a result of volume increases 

the decrease in equity income of 1678 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with the prior year period is primarily the result of a 954 million land valuation adjustment for two of our unconsolidated joint ventures to reduce the carrying values of these investments to their estimated fair values additionally the decrease in 2006 equity income compared with the prior year is also the result of our january 2006 acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems as a result of this acquisition we own 100 of this entity which is consolidated in our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 and 2004 earnings for this investment were recorded in equity income in addition earnings from our 50 investment in a nevadabased joint venture related to the sale of commercial and residential properties decreased in 2006 as the venture substantially completed its operations in 2005 

other income expense net includes the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options insurancerelated expenses and settlements and other nonoperating expenses the changes in other income expense net are due primarily to writeoffs of deposit and preacquisition costs during the fourth quarter of 2006 2005 and 2004 of 827 million 62 million and 138 million respectively and for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 of 1512 million 192 million and 27 million respectively these writeoffs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital during the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2006 we recorded an 185 million charge related to the closure of a production facility located in virginia 

unit settlements decreased 9 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 41487 units compared with the same period in 2005 and increased 18 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 45630 units compared with the same period in 2004 the average selling price for homes closed for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 was 337000 315000 and 287000 respectively changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors including changes in market selling prices and the mix of product closed during each period 

for the year ended december 31 2006 unit net new orders decreased 29 to 33925 units compared with the same period in 2005 for the year ended december 31 2005 unit net new orders increased 17 to 47531 units compared with the same period in 2004 during 2006 net new orders were impacted by the closeout of several large established communities where the replacement communities are still in the early phases of development in addition rising home prices higher interest rates and increased resale home inventories have negatively affected demand for new homes cancellation rates for the fourth quarter of 2006 were approximately 347 compared with 227 and 257 for the same periods in 2005 and 2004 respectively year to date cancellation rates were 294 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with 173 and 176 for the same periods in 2005 and 2004 respectively most markets have experienced a substantial increase in resale home inventory and this combined with declining consumer confidence has resulted in higher cancellation rates and reduced net new orders during 2006 

homebuilding operations continued 

the dollar value of net new orders decreased 28 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with the prior year period and increased 28 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with the same period in 2004 however while net new order dollars decreased during 2006 average selling prices increased or remained stable in many of our markets primarily as a result of favorable shifts in product and geographic mix for the year ended december 31 2006 we had 690 active selling communities an increase of 4 from the same period in 2005 for the year ended december 31 2005 we had 662 active selling communities an increase of 6 from the same period in 2004 ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed was 10255 units at december 31 2006 with a dollar value of 36 billion ending backlog was 17817 units at december 31 2005 with a dollar value of 63 billion

pretax income increased 64 for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to the sale of our investment in su casita a mexicobased mortgage banking company as a result of this transaction we recognized a pretax gain of approximately 316 million 201 million aftertax excluding this gain pretax income increased 19 in 2006 compared with 2005 due to the combination of increased origination principal volume and a shift in product mix to more profitable loans in 2006 21 of total origination dollars were from brokered loans which are less profitable to us compared with 26 in 2005 mortgage origination fees of 155 million in 2006 were 52 million or 25 lower than the 207 million recorded for the same period in 2005 the 25 decrease over the same period in 2005 is due to a shift in product mix towards funded production 

pretax income increased 49 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 2004 due to increased volume and a favorable product mix shift to funded from nonfunded originations in 2005 26 of total origination dollars were from brokered loans which are less profitable to us compared with 36 in 2004 mortgage origination fees of 207 million in 2005 were 02 million or 1 higher than the 205 million recorded for the same period in 2004 the 1 increase over the same period in 2004 is due to higher revenues per loan as brokered origination volume decreased 7 in 2005 when compared with 2004 

financial services operations continued 

the net gain from sale of mortgages of 1108 million in 2006 was 297 million or 37 higher than the 811 million recorded for the same period in 2005 this favorable variance was due primarily to an increase in loans available for sale combined with a favorable shift in product mix in 2006 when compared to 2005 net interest income in 2006 was 98 million or 2 lower than the 10 million for the same period in 2005 the decrease was primarily due to a lower net interest margin partially offset by higher funded origination volume income from our title operations was 20 million in 2006 a decrease of 10 over 2005 due primarily to a decrease in the number of homes closed in 2006 compared to 2005 selling general and administrative expense increased 102 million or 13 from 2005 due primarily to higher operating expenses 

our minority interest in su casita a mexican mortgage banking company contributed income from operations of approximately 350 thousand for the year ended december 31 2005 during february 2005 25 of our investment in the capital stock of su casita was redeemed for a gain of approximately 620 thousand our remaining interest of 1666 was accounted for under the cost method of accounting and therefore no income was recorded for periods subsequent to the sale income from su casita for the year ended december 31 2004 was 4 million in february 2006 we completed the sale of our remaining investment in su casita for approximately 50 million and realized a pretax gain of approximately 316 million related to the transaction

net interest expense was 531 thousand for the year ended december 31 2006 compared with approximately 433 million and 474 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively these variances are the result of an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory 

changes in other expenses net for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 compared with prior years were primarily due to changes in compensationrelated costs additionally during 2004 we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various nonoperating parcels of commercial land held for sale 

interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities during 2006 and 2005 interest in homebuilding inventory increased compared with the prior years due to increased amounts of interest capitalized based on our homebuilding inventory and debt levels in addition during the fourth quarter of 2006 16 million of capitalized interest related to inventory impairment writeoffs was expensed information related to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows 000’s omitted

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation also increases our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them this reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2006 we had agreements to acquire approximately 71800 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments at december 31 2006 we had 3695 million of nonrefundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related homebuilding projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2006 we had outstanding letters of credit of 5912 million performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 18 billion at december 31 2006 are typically outstanding over a period of approximately 35 years we do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2006 these agreements totaled approximately 43 billion pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity at december 31 2006 we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling 436 million 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 9359 million and 8822 million respectively at december 31 2006 and 2005 our proportionate share of joint venture debt was approximately 3128 million and 2979 million respectively at december 31 2006 and 2005 we provided nonrecourse debt guarantees for 3041 million and 2934 million respectively of joint venture debt accordingly we may be liable on a contingent basis through limited guarantees with respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and development debt however we would not be liable other than in instances of fraud misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by us unless the joint venture was unable to perform its contractual borrowing obligations as of december 31 2006 we do not anticipate that we will incur any significant costs under these guarantees that have not already been recognized in our impairment analysis as further discussed in note 4 of our consolidated financial statements 

for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we recognized equity income loss from our unconsolidated joint ventures of 629 million 754 million and 601 million respectively the equity loss recognized during the year ended december 31 2006 includes land valuation adjustments of 954 million which relate to two of our joint ventures located in sacramento california in accordance with their debt guarantees these joint ventures are required to maintain a certain ratio of value of the collateral generally land and improvements as a specified percentage of the loan balance if we are required to make a payment to bring the loan balance below the specified percentage of the loan balance the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes if they are available the land valuation adjustments recorded during 2006 include all significant costs expected at this time under such guarantees 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of our consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality 

revenue recognition 

  homebuilding — homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of the sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by pulte mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as required by sfas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

  financial services — mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold loans are placed on nonaccrual status once they become greater than 90 days past due their contractual terms subsequent payments received are applied according to the contractual terms of the loan 

inventory valuation 

our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value included in inventories are all direct development costs inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost unless they are determined to be impaired in which case these inventories are measured at fair value if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory adjustments may be required in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets” we record valuation adjustments on land inventory and related communities under development when events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired and when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts additionally we also value longlived assets for sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements 

sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis under the specific identification basis cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs and closing costs and commissions construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed prospectively 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold we hedge our residential mortgage loans availableforsale gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans 

an allowance for credit losses is established when specific loans are identified as probable of foreclosure and loss additionally an allowance is provided based on historical losses applied against the most recent quarter of funded production 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill most of which relate to the del webb merger in 2001 intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure impairment based on several accepted valuation methods for assets related to ongoing operations we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows for assets to be disposed of we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets for goodwill we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value 

the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate 

insurance 

we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of the risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 

as of january 1 2006 we are also selfinsured for certain of our medical and dental claims and reserve for costs to cover our liability for such claims based on analysis of historical claims which include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 

stockbased compensation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financing to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2006 and 2005 our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair market value 000’s omitted 

 

 

pulte mortgage operating as a mortgage banker is also subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreedupon terms ie commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2006 and 2005 this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

we minimize interest rate risk by i financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to libor and a1p1 commercial paper rates and ii hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of plus 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results 

at december 31 2006 our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk includes our remaining nonoperating investments in mexico which approximated 35 million

homebuilding operations 

 

consistent with our strategy of serving all major customer segments firsttime first and second moveup and active adult our communities offer a wide variety of home designs including single family detached townhouses condominiums and duplexes at different prices and with varying levels of options and amenities expanding the number of customer segments served within each of our markets has enabled us to approximately double our annual closings over the past five years to a record 45630 homes closed in 2005 over our 55year history we have delivered more than 453000 homes throughout the united states 

on july 31 2001 we merged with del webb in a taxfree stockforstock transaction this merger expanded and supported our leadership position in particular we believe the merger strengthened our position among active adult age 55 and older homebuyers added important strategic land positions provided operational savings from economies of scale bolstered our purchasing leverage and enhanced our overall competitive position in accordance with our operational strategy we continue to evaluate available strategic acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our longrange goals 

as of december 31 2005 our homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 662 communities at sales prices ranging from 62000 to 24 million sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 66 of our communities fall within the range of 100000 to 350000 with a 2005 average unit selling price of 315000 compared with 287000 in 2004 259000 in 2003 242000 in 2002 and 225000 in 2001 sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales decreased to 72 in 2005 from 80 in 2004 83 in 2003 86 in 2002 and 82 in 2001 this trend can be attributed to an increase in sales of townhouses condominiums and duplexes which are most popular among our firsttime and active adult homebuyers our homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result better insulate us from demand changes in individual markets as of december 31 2005 our homebuilding business operated in 54 markets spanning 27 states with 17817 units in backlog valued at approximately 63 billion 

land acquisition and development 

we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community build out requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes as a result land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2005 we controlled approximately 363000 lots of which 174000 were owned and 189000 were under option agreements 

homebuilding operations continued 

sales and marketing 

we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer profiles segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group 

to meet the demands of our various customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features in certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the sales price standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings appliances and a variety of available flooring and carpet 

typically our sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including the customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the superintendent 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have great success with the firsttime buyer in the low to moderate price range in such cases financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company we also enjoy strong sales to the moveup buyer and in certain markets offer semicustom homes in higher price ranges 

through our del webb brand we are better able to address the needs of active adults among the fastest growing homebuying segments we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these communities with highly amenitized products such as golf courses recreational centers and educational classes offer the active adult buyer many options to maintain an active lifestyle 

we have received recognition and awards as a result of our achievements as a homebuilder in march 2005 pulte was named as a topranked homebuilder in businessweek’s list of 50 best performers among the sp 500 coming in at number 12 in april 2005 we were ranked 181 on the fortune 500 list additionally in may 2005 we were named to the fortune magazine list of most desirable mba employers for 2005 in july 2005 we also made our first appearance on the fortune 40 list of “best stocks to buy now” 

in addition our austin chicago dallasft worth detroit ft myersnaples houston jacksonville las vegas minneapolisst paul north inland empire orlando palm beach philadelphia tampa bay tucson and washington dc markets were recognized for ranking the highest in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study eight of our markets came in second place while three obtained third place positions the survey of thirty us markets with pulte presence in twentyseven of those markets noted customer service home readiness at the time of closing and the company’s sales staff as the three factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of satisfaction developing the pulte homes brand and leveraging the strength of the “divosta” “del webb” and “sun city” tradenames helps to distinguish our communities from the competition and can often be rewarded with the advantages of additional sales pace choice community locations and reduced overall customer acquisition costs 

our homeowner for life tm philosophy has increased our business from those who have previously owned a pulte home or have been referred by a pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home owning experience we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements and other advertising displays in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom wwwdivostacom and wwwespanolpultecom provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us approximately 51 million potential customers visited our websites during 2005 

homebuilding operations continued 

construction 

the construction process for our homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we believe that pulte preferred partnerships p 3  an extension of our quality assurance program continues to establish new standards for contractor relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes 

we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and when possible by building on contiguous lots to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives 

we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future and have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets 

competition and other factors 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration “fha” or veterans administration “va” mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is highly competitive in each of our market areas there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with the resales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units forsale or to rent including apartment builders may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in the costs of building materials and labor 3 changes in interest rates 4 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 5 various demographic factors 6 changes in federal income tax laws 7 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 8 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our homebuyers but also services the general public we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma fhlmc and private investors 

our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado and charlotte north carolina using a mortgage operations center “moc” concept we also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at mortgage application centers “mac” in denver and charlotte our sales representatives who are the mortgage customers’ main contact forward the loan applications to a mac loan counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the moc for processing we believe both the moc and the mac improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers 

in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to outside investors 

financial services operations continued 

our capture rate for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 was approximately 89 88 and 83 respectively our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we originated mortgage loans for approximately 75 72 and 65 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented 98 92 and 83 respectively of our total originations 

we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time generally less than four months after the loan is originated which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 days after sale or securitization 

the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our homebuyers and to the general public the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors 

in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business 

financial information about geographic areas 

we currently operate primarily within the united states and have some nonoperating foreign entities which are insignificant to our consolidated financial results 

discontinued operations 

mexico homebuilding operations 

in january 2005 the minority shareholders of pulte mexico s de rl de cv “pulte mexico” exercised a put option under the terms of a reorganization agreement dated as of december 31 2001 to sell their shares to us the consummation of which resulted in our owning 100 of pulte mexico in march 2005 we purchased 60 of the minority interest of pulte mexico for approximately 187 million in cash in june 2005 we purchased the remaining 40 of the minority interest of pulte mexico for approximately 125 million in cash

first heights 

during the first quarter of 1994 we adopted a plan of disposal for first heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related mortgage banking first heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers the sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994 although we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time contractual disputes precluded us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan 

in august 2005 the united states court of appeals affirmed the united states court of federal claims final judgment that we had been damaged by approximately 487 million as a result of the united states government’s breach of contract in connection with the enactment of section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 in december 2005 we received payment of the judgment in the amount of 487 million which was recorded as income from discontinued operations 

in september 2005 first heights received notice confirming the voluntary dissolution of the first heights bank the office of thrift supervision also canceled first heights’ charter accordingly the daytoday activities of first heights which had been principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the united states government have now ceased 

other nonoperating 

other nonoperating is comprised primarily of pulte homes inc and pulte diversified companies inc both of which are holding companies the primary purpose of these entities is to support the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered around new business development and operating efficiencies business development activities include the pursuit of additional opportunities as well as the development of innovative building components and processes other nonoperating also includes the activities associated with supporting a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange 

other nonoperating assets include equity investments in subsidiaries shortterm financial instruments and affiliate advances liabilities include senior and subordinated debt and income taxes other nonoperating revenues consist primarily of investment earnings of excess funds while expenses include costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its subsidiaries’ operations and investigating strategic initiatives 

organizationemployees 

all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit andor corporate senior management 

at december 31 2005 we employed approximately 13400 people our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is based on the performance of the applicable business unit or subsidiary our corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our overall performance each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

downward changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

the residential homebuilding industry is sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors such as the level of employment consumer confidence consumer income availability of financing and interest rate levels adverse changes in any of these conditions generally or in the markets where we operate could decrease demand and pricing for new homes in these areas or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes either of which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings 

the homebuilding industry has not experienced an economic down cycle in a number of years which may have resulted in an overvaluation of land and new homes 

although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical it has not undergone an economic down cycle in a number of years further in recent years land and home prices rose significantly in many of our markets this has led some people to assert that the prices of land new homes and the stock prices of homebuilding companies may be inflated and may decline if the demand for land and new homes weakens a decline in the prices for land and new homes could adversely affect both our revenues and margins a decline in our stock price could make raising capital through stock issuances more difficult and expensive 

future increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or our financial results 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through our mortgage bank interest rates have been at historical lows for several years many homebuyers have also chosen adjustable rate interest only or mortgages that involve initial lower monthly payments as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these factors could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business our financial services business could be impacted to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ 

in addition we believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes we also believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market however the federal government has recently sought to reduce the size of the homeloan portfolios and operations of these two governmentsponsored enterprises any limitations or restrictions on the availability of the financing or on the liquidity by them could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

our future growth may require additional capital which may not be available 

our operations require significant amounts of cash we may be required to seek additional capital whether from sales of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings for the future growth and development of our business we can give no assurance as to the availability of such additional capital or if available whether it would be on terms acceptable to us moreover the indentures for most of our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving credit facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital it could reduce our sales and may adversely affect our future growth and financial results 

competition for homebuyers could reduce our deliveries or decrease our profitability 

the housing industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes we compete in each of our markets with numerous national regional and local homebuilders this competition with other homebuilders could reduce the number of homes we deliver or cause us to accept reduced margins in order to maintain sales volume 

we also compete with resales of existing used or foreclosed homes housing speculators and available rental housing increased competitive conditions in the residential resale or rental market in the regions where we operate could decrease demand for new homes and increase cancellations of sales contracts in backlog 

our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices in accordance with our land investment criteria 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for suitable land the availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land for purchase that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control including land availability in general competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property inflation in land prices and zoning allowable housing density and other regulatory requirements should suitable lots or land become less available the number of homes we may be able to build and sell could be reduced and the cost of land could be increased perhaps substantially which could adversely impact our results of operations 

our longterm ability to build homes depends on our acquiring land suitable for residential building at reasonable prices in locations where we want to build over the past few years we have experienced an increase in competition for suitable land as a result of land constraints in many of our markets as competition for suitable land increases and as available land is developed the cost of acquiring suitable remaining land could rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased land costs we may not be able to pass through to our customers any increased land costs which could adversely impact our revenues earnings and margins 

supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive for skilled labor and materials increased costs or shortages of skilled labor andor lumber framing concrete steel and other building materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays we generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to those customers who have already entered into sale contracts as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the home at the time the contract is signed which may be well in advance of the construction of the home sustained increases in construction costs may over time erode our margins and pricing competition for materials and labor may restrict our ability to pass on any additional costs thereby decreasing our margins 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state and local governing authorities for our homes to qualify for fha or va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

government regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results continued 

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by applicable agencies these may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

homebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business we record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensations and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries increase costs and decrease demand for new homes in affected areas 

our homebuilding operations are located in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries increase costs by damaging inventories reduce the availability of materials and negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas furthermore if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

inflation may result in increased costs that we may not be able to recoup if demand declines 

inflation can have a longterm impact on us because increasing costs of land materials and labor may require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in which case we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease 

future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could have an adverse effect on our operations 

a future terrorist attack against the united states could cause a sharp decrease in the number of new contracts signed for homes and an increase in the cancellation of existing contracts accordingly adverse developments in the war on terrorism future terrorist attacks against the united states or increased domestic and international instability could adversely affect our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing business operations we believe that none of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

storm water discharge practices 

in april 2004 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us we have provided the epa with this information although the matter has since been referred to the united states department of justice “doj” for enforcement the epa has asked that we engage in “prefiling” negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation we are actively engaged in these negotiations if the negotiations fail and the doj alleges that we have violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges the government may seek injunctive relief and penalties we believe that we have defenses to any such allegations at this time however we can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we currently estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution 

first heightsrelated litigation 

we were a party to a lawsuit relating to first heights’ 1988 acquisition from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation “fslic” and first heights’ ownership of five failed texas thrifts the lawsuit was filed on december 26 1996 in the united states court of federal claims washington dc by pulte homes inc pulte diversified companies inc and first heights collectively “the pulte parties” against the united states we asserted breach of contract on the part of the united states in connection with the enactment of section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 “obra” that provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that we claim we were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed texas thrifts we also asserted other claims concerning the contract including that the united states through the fdic as receiver improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ preacquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in an effort to deprive us of tax benefits for which they had contracted 

on august 17 2001 the united states court of federal claims ruled that the united states government was liable to us for breach of contract by enacting section 13224 of obra in september 2003 the united states court of federal claims issued final judgment that we had been damaged by approximately 487 million as a result of the united states government’s breach of contract with us the united states government and we appealed the final judgment to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in october 2003 

in august 2005 the appeals court affirmed the united states court of federal claims judgment in its entirety in december 2005 we received payment of the judgment in the amount of 487 million which was recorded as income from discontinued operations

the following table presents selected information for our homebuilding operations

homebuilding operations continued 

continued strong demand for new homes an increase in the number of active selling communities and market share expansion drove increases in net new orders unit settlements and unit backlog net new orders increased 17 to a record 47531 units for the year ended december 31 2005 net new orders for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 16 to 40576 units compared with 34989 units for the year ended december 31 2003 

home settlements set a record for the year ended december 31 2005 at 45630 units an increase of 18 over the same period in 2004 in 2004 home settlements also reached a record high increasing 18 to 38612 units active communities increased from 535 in 2003 to 626 in 2004 to 662 in 2005 

changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors including price increases the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers the average selling price for our homes increased 10 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 315000 compared with 2004 and increased to 287000 in 2004 from 259000 in 2003 the most significant price increases for both 2005 and 2004 were in the west and northeast geographic areas and in florida in the southeast geographic area 

ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed grew to a record 17817 units at december 31 2005 compared with 15916 units at december 31 2004 and 13952 units at december 31 2003 the dollar value of our backlog was up 22 to 63 billion at december 31 2005 compared with 52 billion at december 31 2004 and 41 billion at december 31 2003 our most significant increase in unit backlog at december 31 2005 occurred in the central region which had unit increases of 106 resulting from increased net new orders our most significant increases at december 31 2004 occurred in the southeast and west which had unit increases of 42 and 10 respectively 

in the fourth quarter of 2004 we lowered pricing in las vegas to better align pricing in our communities with pricing in the market this action was in response to a period of slow signups and increased cancellation rates which we attributed to our then abovemarket pricing however since the price reductions took effect in the fourth quarter of 2004 our communities in las vegas have experienced improved traffic and new order activity 

the west contributed the largest portion of our operating activities compared with the other geographic areas in the homebuilding operations representing 35 of unit settlements and 34 of unit net new orders for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 37 of settlements and of net new orders during 2004 and 35 of settlements and 37 of net new orders during 2003 the west also contributed the largest portion of our backlog compared with other geographic areas in the homebuilding operations representing 39 43 and 44 of the total homebuilding backlog units at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

the following table presents states that represent 10 or more of unit settlements and settlement revenues for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 our homebuilding operations controlled approximately 362600 and 343400 lots respectively approximately 173800 and 158000 lots were owned and approximately 133400 and 125800 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively in addition there were approximately 55400 lots under option agreements at december 31 2005 pending approval that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations this compared to 59600 lots at december 31 2004 

the total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated 57 billion at december 31 2005 in addition the total purchase price applicable to land under option pending approval was valued at 19 billion at december 31 2005 land option agreements which may be cancelled at our discretion may extend over several years and are secured by deposits and advanced costs totaling 4448 million which are generally nonrefundable 

the following table presents a summary of pretax income for our homebuilding operations 000’s omitted 

 

 

 homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2005 increased 80 basis points over 2004 to 234 and in 2004 increased 200 basis points to 226 compared with 2003 the increases are due to strong consumer demand positive home pricing favorable shifts in product and geographic mix the benefits of leveragebuy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management during the fourth quarter of 2005 homebuilding gross profit margins were 223 compared with 227 in the same period of 2004 this margin decrease of 40 basis points is attributable primarily to a 4 inflationary increase in land development costs such as petroleumbased products and cement under our accounting policies lot costs are expensed on an average project cost basis due to the significant cost increases experienced in the fourth quarter of 2005 we have adjusted our estimates accordingly such adjustments impacted the amount of lot costs recognized and will continue to affect lot costs prospectively 

homebuilding operations continued 

we consider land acquisition one of our core competencies we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers we will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments we also will on occasion sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders gross profits from land sales were 182 million and 998 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively representing a decrease of 816 million and an increase of 339 million respectively from the previous year’s total revenues and their related gainslosses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of land sales we continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital included in other assets is approximately 2577 million in land held for disposition as of december 31 2005 as compared to 2301 million and 2512 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

for the year ended december 31 2005 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues decreased 110 basis points to 77 compared with 2004 after decreasing 90 basis points to 88 in 2004 compared with 2003 the conversion improvement in 2005 can be attributed to an increase in average selling prices our internal initiatives focused on controlling costs and better overhead leverage as a result of volume increases the improvement in 2004 can be attributed to greater leverage as a result of volume increases and the favorable pricing environment for our homes 

equity income for 2005 and 2004 includes earnings from our 50 investment in a nevadabased joint venture related to the sale of commercial and residential properties also included are earnings from our 50 joint venture that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems acquired in january 2004 in january 2006 we exercised our option to purchase the remaining 50 interest in the entity in 2006 this investment will become a whollyowned subsidiary of the company and will be consolidated in our financial statements 

other income expense net includes the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options insurancerelated expenses and settlements and other nonoperating expenses for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 the changes in other income expense net are due primarily to writeoffs of deposit and preacquisition costs these writeoffs vary in amount from year to year as we continue to evaluate potential land acquisitions for the most effective use of capital 

financial services operations 

we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries 

we originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors also we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held generally less than four months we do not amortize the servicing asset since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts there are no impairment issues related to these assets 

the following table presents mortgage origination data for our financial services operations 

 

pretax income of our financial services operations was 706 million 474 million and 688 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

financial services operations continued 

mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended december 31 2005 increased 22 and 27 respectively over 2004 mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 23 and 35 respectively over 2003 this growth can be attributed to increases in the capture rate of 140 basis points to 892 in 2005 and 510 basis points to 878 in 2004 combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business our homebuilding customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production representing 98 of pulte mortgage unit production for 2005 compared with 92 in 2004 and 83 in 2003 

adjustable rate mortgages arms represented 45 of total funded origination dollars and 39 of total funded origination units for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 43 and 42 respectively in 2004 and 24 and 22 respectively in 2003 interest only mortgages a component of arms represented 65 of arms origination dollars and 56 of arms origination units for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 42 and 30 in 2004 and 13 and 8 respectively in 2003 interest only mortgages represented 29 18 and 3 respectively of total funded origination dollars for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

refinancings represented 1 of total loan production in 2005 compared with 3 in 2004 and 8 in 2003 our customers’ average fico scores for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were 741 737 and 724 respectively combined loantovalue was 81 for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively at december 31 2005 loan application backlog was 42 billion compared with 35 billion and 22 billion at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

pretax income increased 49 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 2004 due to increased volume and a favorable product mix shift to funded from nonfunded originations in 2005 26 of total origination dollars were from brokered loans which are less profitable to us compared with 36 in 2004 mortgage origination fees of 207 million in 2005 were 02 million or 1 higher than the 205 million recorded for the same period in 2004 the 1 increase over the same period in 2004 is due to higher revenues per loan as brokered origination volume decreased 7 in 2005 when compared to 2004 

the net gain from sale of mortgages of 811 million in 2005 was 308 million or 61 higher than the 503 million recorded for the same period in 2004 this favorable variance was due primarily to an increase in loans available for sale combined with a more favorable interest rate environment in 2005 when compared to 2004 net interest income in 2005 was 10 million or 3 higher than the 97 million for the same period in 2004 the increase was due mainly to increased funded origination volume offset by a lower interest rate margin income from our title operations was 223 million in 2005 an increase of 27 over 2004 selling general and administrative expense increased 10 million or 17 from 2004 due primarily to an increase in origination volume 

our minority interest in su casita a mexican mortgage banking company contributed income from operations of approximately 350 thousand for the year ended december 31 2005 during february 2005 25 of our investment in the capital stock of su casita was redeemed for a gain of approximately 620 thousand our remaining interest of 1666 was accounted for under the cost method of accounting and therefore no income was recorded for periods subsequent to the sale income from su casita for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 was 4 million and 44 million respectively in february 2006 we completed the sale of our remaining investment in su casita for approximately 50 million and realized a pretax gain of approximately 30 million related to the transaction 

pretax income decreased 31 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 2003 as increased volume was offset by changes in product mix to arms which generally have a lower profit per loan than fixed rate products the shift to arms is attributable to customer mortgage product preference in addition in 2004 36 of total origination dollars were from brokered loans which are less profitable to us compared with 16 in 2003 mortgage origination fees increased to 205 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 75 million in 2003 due to the increase in brokered loans gains from the sale of mortgages during 2004 decreased 141 million or 22 from 644 million in 2003 and net interest income decreased 55 million to 97 million during 2004 as compared with 151 million in 2003 these decreases were due to the product mix shifts and an unfavorable interest rate environment in 2004 compared with 2003 income from our title operations was 176 million in 2004 an increase of 30 over 2003 selling general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 41 to 575 million compared with 2003 due to increased origination volume 

we hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments for the year ended december 31 2005 we did not recognize any material net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument we also did not recognize any material net gains or losses during 2005 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur at december 31 2005 we expect to reclassify 18 thousand net of taxes of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans 

other nonoperating 

other nonoperating expenses net consists of income and expenses related to corporate services provided to our subsidiaries these expenses are incurred for financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange accordingly these results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve 

the following table presents results of operations 000’s omitted 

 

interest expense net of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory decreased 9 to 433 million in 2005 and increased 20 to 474 million in 2004 the decrease for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with the prior year is due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory as well as an increase in interest income the increase for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with the prior year is due to an increase in the debt levels necessary to support our growth 

the increase in other expenses net for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with the prior year was due to higher compensationrelated costs other expenses net in 2004 increased 73 million compared with 2003 partially due to increased charitable contributions additionally during 2004 and 2003 we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various nonoperating parcels of commercial land held for sale 

interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities during 2005 interest in homebuilding inventory increased primarily as a result of higher levels of inventory and debt consistent with the growth of our company during the fourth quarter of 2005 we increased the amount of interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory the increase was based on our homebuilding inventory and debt levels and is consistent with the growth of the company information related to corporate interest capitalized into homebuilding inventory is as follows 000’s omitted

our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors in 2005 our effective tax rate was 369 compared to 376 in 2004 and 379 in 2003 the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2005 was principally due to the new manufacturing deduction established by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2004 was principally due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters we anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2006 will be approximately 37 

our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 amounted to 187 million while net cash used in operating activities was 6922 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase from 2004 to 2005 was principally due to an increase in net income which included 487 million of cash income received as a result of a favorable judgment for our former thrift operation our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 3364 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 the increases in net income were offset primarily by significant investments in land necessary to support the continued growth of the business 

liquidity and capital resources continued 

cash used in investing activities was 253 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared with 1986 million in the prior year the change in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries during 2005 of 1429 million increases in distributions from unconsolidated entities of 419 million offset by increases in capital expenditures of 137 million during 2005 we invested approximately 373 million in three new joint ventures that develop andor sell land within the united states also we contributed 1246 million of additional capital contributions to and received 108 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31 2005 further we incurred approximately 889 million in capital expenditures to support the growth of our business cash used in investing activities was 1986 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 43 million in the prior year the change in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to our investments in unconsolidated entities during january 2004 we invested 35 million for a 50 ownership interest in an entity that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems during 2004 we invested approximately 1178 million in three new joint ventures that develop andor sell land in the united states also we contributed 442 million of additional capital contributions to and received 661 million in capital distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31 2004 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 7004 million for the year ended december 31 2005 cash inflows from financing activities of 1 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 are primarily attributed to proceeds from our 350 million 52 senior notes and 300 million 6 senior notes issued in february 2005 proceeds from pulte mortgage’s line of credit of approximately 2756 million proceeds from limited recourse collateralized financing arrangements of approximately 468 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 312 million cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily relate to the repayment of our 125 million 73 senior notes in october 2005 approximately 336 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders and 1432 million used to repurchase our common stock 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 8096 million for the year ended december 31 2004 cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 are primarily attributed to proceeds received from our 500 million 525 senior notes issued in january 2004 and our 400 million 4875 senior notes issued in july 2004 and 44 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options cash outflows from financing activities for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily relate to the repayment of our 112 million 8375 senior notes in august 2004 redemption of the remaining 77 million of del webb 1025 senior subordinated notes in february 2004 approximately 254 million of cash dividends paid to our shareholders 449 million used to repay borrowings and 147 million used to repurchase our common stock 

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 1289 million reflecting proceeds from the 300 million senior notes issued in february and the 400 million senior notes issued in may and proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repayment of debt dividends paid and stock repurchases 

in february 2005 we sold 350 million of 52 senior notes which mature on february 15 2015 and 300 million of 6 senior notes which mature on february 15 2035 which are guaranteed by us and certain of our 100owned subsidiaries these notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness proceeds from the sale were used to repay the indebtedness of our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes including continued investment in our business 

in october 2005 we restructured and amended the 5year unsecured revolving credit facility increasing the borrowing availability from 138 billion to 1615 billion and extending the maturity date from september 2009 to october 2010 with pricing more favorable to us we subsequently increased the credit facility to 166 billion the credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature under which the credit facility may be increased to 225 billion we have the capacity to issue letters of credit up to 1125 billion borrowing availability is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding the credit facility contains restrictive covenants the most restrictive of which requires us not to exceed a debttototal capitalization ratio of 60 as defined in the agreement 

pursuant to the two 100 million stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors in october 2002 and 2005 for a total stock repurchase authorization of 200 million we have repurchased a total of 6120800 shares for 1805 million at december 31 2005 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 195 million in february 2006 our board of directors approved an increase to our stock repurchase authorization for an additional 200 million in openmarket transactions or otherwise

inflation 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation also increases our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices for the three months ended december 31 2005 our gross margins have been negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points due to inflation compared to the same period in the prior year for the year ended december 31 2005 inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 

 

 

 we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them this reduces our financial risks associated with longterm land holdings at december 31 2005 we had agreements to acquire approximately 189000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments at december 31 2005 we had 4448 million of nonrefundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these agreements 

the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2005

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2005 we had outstanding letters of credit of 5315 million performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 179 billion at december 31 2005 are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 35 years we do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2005 these agreements totaled approximately 76 billion pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity at december 31 2005 we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling 767 million 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 aggregate outstanding debt of unconsolidated joint ventures was 8822 million and 581 million respectively the increase in debt at december 31 2005 is a result of the growth in the number of joint venture arrangements as well as increased land development activities for these entities our proportionate share of our joint venture debt as of december 31 2005 was approximately 294 million for which we provide limited recourse debt guarantees of approximately 288 million accordingly we may be liable on a contingent basis through limited guarantees with respect to a portion of the secured land acquisition and development debt however we would not be liable other than in instances of fraud misrepresentation or other bad faith actions by us unless the joint venture was unable to perform its contractual borrowing obligations as of december 31 2005 we do not anticipate that we will incur any significant costs under these guarantees 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

revenue recognition 

  homebuilding — homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed we do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return 

  financial services — mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

inventory valuation 

our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value included in inventories are all direct development costs inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost unless they are determined to be impaired in which case these inventories are measured at fair value if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory adjustments may be required 

we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

inventory valuation continued 

sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis under the specific identification basis cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs and closing costs and commissions construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale 

residential mortgage loans availableforsale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold we hedge our residential mortgage loans availableforsale gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill most of which relate to the del webb merger in 2001 intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure impairment based on one of three methods for assets related to ongoing operations we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows for assets to be disposed of we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets for goodwill we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value 

the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations 

allowance for warranties 

home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate 

insurance 

we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability property errors and omissions workers compensation and other business insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits through our captive insurance subsidiaries we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by such policies based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported our total reserves for such items were 1534 million and 1156 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively expenses related to such claims were approximately 701 million 584 million and 409 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued 

stockbased compensation 

on december 15 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment which amends sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas no 123r requires that all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be accounted for at fair value the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition under sfas no 123r we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption we previously adopted the fairvaluebased method of accounting for sharebased payments under sfas no 123 effective january 1 2003 using the prospective method described in sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure currently the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and will continue to use this model upon adoption of sfas 123r because sfas no 123r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date and we adopted sfas no 123 using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted modified or settled after the adoption date compensation cost for some previously granted awards that was not recognized under sfas no 123 will be recognized under sfas no 123r in addition our stock option participant agreements provide continued vesting for certain retirement eligible employees who have achieved a predetermined level of service based on their combined age and years of service we currently recognize the related compensation cost ratably over the nominal vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of sfas no 123r we will record related compensation cost over the period through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide services to earn the award because these amounts are not significant the adoption of sfas no 123r is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2005 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2005 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” ratified its emerging issues task force consensus in issue no 045 “determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights” “issue 045” this guidance states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership with limited exceptions we do not expect the provisions of issue 045 to impact our current accounting treatment for limited partnerships because we are not a general partner issue 045 is effective june 29 2005 for new limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships where the partnership agreement has been modified and is otherwise effective for the first fiscal period beginning after december 15 2005 for all other limited partnerships 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections — a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” sfas 154 this statement replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle this statement requires retrospective application to financial statements of prior periods for changes in accounting principle this statement is effective january 1 2006 and has been determined to have no impact on our results of operations or its financial position 

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” fsp 1091 the american jobs creation act which was signed into law in october 2004 provides a 3 tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities income for 2005 when fully phasedin the deduction will be 9 of the lesser of “qualified production activities income” or taxable income based on the guidance provided by fsp 1091 this deduction was accounted for as a special deduction under sfas no 109 and reduced tax expense tax benefits resulting from the new deduction were recorded during 2005 and resulted in a reduction in our federal income tax rate see note 9 to consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our ratesensitive financing to the extent longterm rates decline the following tables set forth as of december 31 2005 and 2004 our ratesensitive financing obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weightedaverage interest rates and estimated fair market value 000’s omitted 

 

 

pulte mortgage operating as a mortgage banker is also subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreedupon terms ie commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2005 and 2004 this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float 

we minimize interest rate risk by i financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to libor and a1p1 commercial paper rates and ii hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of plus 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results 

at december 31 2005 our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our remaining nonoperating investments in mexico which approximated 62 million and our mortgage banking joint venture investment in mexico which approximated 151 million

homebuilding operations continued land acquisition and development we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain del webb active adult developments and other selected large projects for which the completion of community build out requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes as a result land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2004 we controlled approximately 343000 lots of which 158000 were owned and 185000 were under option agreements sales and marketing we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer profiles segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group to meet the demands of our various domestic customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features in certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the sales price standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings appliances and a variety of available flooring and carpet typically our domestic sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including the customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the superintendent 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have great success with the firsttime buyer in the low to moderate price range in such cases financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company we also enjoy strong sales to the moveup buyer and in certain markets offer semicustom homes in higher price ranges as a result of the del webb merger we are better able to address the needs of active adults among the fastest growing homebuying segments we offer both destination communities and “in place” communities for those buyers who prefer to remain in their current geographic area these communities with highly amenitized products such as golf courses recreational centers and educational classes offer the active adult buyer many options to maintain an active lifestyle 5 

homebuilding operations continued sales and marketing continued we have received recognition and awards as a result of our achievements as a homebuilder in 2004 the environmental protection agency named pulte as an energy star partner of the year pulte was also named as a topranked homebuilder in businessweek’s list of 50 best performers among the sp 500 coming in at number 11 we were number 78 on the fortune 100 fastestgrowing companies list pulte was the recipient of the inauguaral jd power and associates platinum award for customer satisfaction and was the winner of the first national housing quality “gold award” in addition our charlotte dallasft worth detroit ft myersnaples houston jacksonville las vegas minneapolisst paul orlando palm beach philadelphia tampa tucson and washington dc markets were recognized for ranking the highest in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study nine of our markets came in second place while six obtained third place positions the survey of twentyfive u s markets with pulte presence in twentyfour of those markets noted customer service home readiness at the time of closing and the company’s sales staff as the three factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of satisfaction developing the pulte homes brand and leveraging the strength of the “divosta” “del webb” and “sun city” tradenames helps to distinguish our communities from the competition and can often be rewarded with the advantages of additional sales pace choice community locations and reduced overall customer acquisition costs our homeowner for life tm philosophy has increased our business from those who have previously owned a pulte home or have been referred by a pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home owning experience we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements and other advertising displays in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom wwwdivostacom and wwwespanolpultecom provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us approximately 35 million potential customers visited our websites during 2004 our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification of underserved market demand with strong emphasis on quality initiatives and customer service in mexico where our product is focused largely on social interest housing sales and marketing efforts target areas experiencing population and employment growth construction the construction process for our domestic homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we believe that pulte preferred partnerships p 3  an extension of our quality assurance program continues to establish new standards for contractor relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and when possible by building on contiguous lots to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives housing in mexico and puerto rico consists primarily of reinforced poured concrete concrete block andor brick construction with flat roofs and public water electric and sanitary system connections building materials supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction work is performed by general contractors andor independent contractors which in many cases include both labor and materials we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future and have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets 6 

homebuilding operations continued competition and other factors our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is highly competitive in each of our market areas there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with the resales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units forsale or to rent including apartment builders may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in the costs of building materials and labor 3 changes in interest rates 4 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 5 various demographic factors 6 changes in federal income tax laws 7 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 8 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state local and foreign governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration “fha” or veterans administration “va” mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state local and foreign laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance financial services operations we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries mortgage banking our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our domestic homebuyers but also services the general public we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association “gnma” federal national mortgage association “fnma” federal home loan mortgage corporation “fhlmc” and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma and fhlmc our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado using a mortgage operations center “moc” concept we also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center “mac” in denver our sales representatives who are the mortgage customers’ main contact forward the loan applications to a mac loan counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the moc for processing we believe both the moc and the mac improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to outside investors our capture rate for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 was approximately 88 83 and 78 respectively our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we originated mortgage loans for approximately 84 73 and 68 respectively of the homes we sold domestically such originations represented 92 83 and 85 respectively of our originations we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time generally less than four months after the loan is originated which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 days after sale or securitization 7 

financial services operations continued mortgage banking continued the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our homebuyers and to the general public the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business discontinued operations first heights during the first quarter of 1994 we adopted a plan of disposal for first heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related mortgage banking first heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers the sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994 although we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time contractual disputes precluded us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan first heights’ daytoday activities are principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the united states government discussed in item 3 and are not reflective of the active operations of the former thrift such as maintaining traditional transaction accounts eg checking and savings accounts or making loans accordingly such operations are presented as discontinued argentina in january 2005 we sold all of our argentina operations to an argentine company involved in residential and commercial real estate development the disposition of these operations was the chosen action to improve our overall returns at december 31 2004 the argentina operations have been classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements previously the argentina operations were included in the homebuilding segment total assets to be disposed of at december 31 2004 were 154 million consisting primarily of cash and inventories total liabilities to be disposed of at december 31 2004 were 137 million and consisted primarily of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities corporate corporate is a nonoperating segment that is comprised primarily of pulte homes inc and pulte diversified companies inc both of which are holding companies the primary purpose of corporate is to support the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered around new business development and operating efficiencies business development activities include the pursuit of additional domestic and international opportunities as well as the development of innovative building components and processes corporate also includes the activities associated with supporting a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange corporate assets include equity investments in its subsidiaries shortterm financial instruments and affiliate advances liabilities include senior and subordinated debt and income taxes corporate revenues consist primarily of investment earnings of excess funds while its expenses include costs associated with supporting a publicly traded company and its subsidiaries’ operations and investigating strategic initiatives organizationemployees all subsidiaries and operating units operate independently with respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit andor corporate senior management at december 31 2004 we employed approximately 13000 people our employees are not represented by any union contracted work however may be performed by union contractors homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is based on the performance of the applicable business unit or subsidiary our corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on our overall performance each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management acts in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and contractor relations to be satisfactory 8

 item 3 legal proceedings we are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing business operations we believe that none of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows storm water discharge practices in april 2004 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us we have provided the epa with this information although the matter has since been referred to the united states department of justice “doj” for enforcement the epa has asked that we engage in “prefiling” negotiations to resolve the matter short of litigation we are actively engaged in these negotiations if the negotiations fail and the doj alleges that we have violated regulatory requirements applicable to storm water discharges the government may seek injunctive relief and penalties we believe that we have defenses to any such allegations at this time however we can neither predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we currently estimate the costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution first heightsrelated litigation we are a party to a lawsuit relating to first heights’ 1988 acquisition from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation “fslic” and first heights’ ownership of five failed texas thrifts the lawsuit the court of federal claims case was filed on december 26 1996 in the united states court of federal claims washington dc by pulte homes inc pulte diversified companies inc and first heights collectively the pulte parties against the united states in the court of federal claims case the pulte parties assert breaches of contract on the part of the united states in connection with the enactment of section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 “obra” that provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the pulte parties claim they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed texas thrifts the pulte parties also assert other claims concerning the contract including that the united states through the fdic as receiver improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ preacquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in an effort to deprive the pulte parties of tax benefits for which they had contracted on august 17 2001 the united states court of federal claims ruled that the united states government is liable to the pulte parties for breach of contract by enacting section 13224 of obra in september 2003 the united states court of federal claims issued final judgment that the pulte parties had been damaged by approximately 487 million as a result of the united states government’s breach of contract with them the united states government and the pulte parties appealed the final judgment to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in october 2003 accordingly any gain related to this litigation will be recognized only upon final resolution 9

homebuilding operations continued changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors including price increases the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers the average selling price for our homes increased 11 for the year ended december 31 2004 to 287000 compared with 2003 and increased to 259000 in 2003 from 242000 in 2002 the most significant price increases for both 2004 and 2003 were in the west northeast and florida in the southeast geographic areas ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed grew to a record 15916 units at december 31 2004 compared with 13952 units at december 31 2003 and 10605 units at december 31 2002 the dollar value of our backlog was up 24 to 52 billion at december 31 2004 compared with 41 billion at december 31 2003 and 29 billion at december 31 2002 our most significant increases at december 31 2004 occurred in the southeast and west which had unit increases of 42 and 10 respectively at december 31 2003 compared with december 31 2002 strong demand resulted in significant increases in backlog for all geographic areas of the country except the midwest as announced on october 4 2004 we lowered pricing in las vegas to better align pricing in our communities with pricing in the market this action was in response to a period of slow signups and increased cancellation rates which we attributed to our then abovemarket pricing however since the price reductions took effect in october of 2004 our communities in las vegas have experienced improved traffic and new order activity las vegas backlog totaled 883 units with a value of 379 million at december 31 2004 which represented 6 and 7 of total domestic homebuilding units and dollars respectively at december 31 2003 las vegas backlog totaled 1770 units with a value of 6276 million which represented 13 and 15 of total domestic homebuilding units and dollars respectively during august and september of 2004 four hurricanes occurred throughout florida and the southeastern areas of the united states we sustained minimal property damage but did experience delayed home settlements and incurred additional overhead expenses related to lost workdays and cleanup efforts undertaken as a result of the hurricanes further the impact of the storms delayed the opening of several new communities and resulted in shortages of building materials in some florida markets the west contributed the largest portion of our operating activities compared with the other geographic areas in the domestic homebuilding operations representing 37 of unit net new orders and unit settlements for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 35 of settlements and 37 of net new orders during 2003 and 32 of settlements and 33 of net new orders during 2002 the west contributed the largest portion of our backlog compared with other geographic areas in the domestic homebuilding operations representing 43 44 and 38 of the total domestic homebuilding backlog units at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the following table presents markets that represent 10 or more of unit new orders unit settlements and settlement revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002

 homebuilding gross profit margins from home sales in 2004 increased 200 basis points over 2003 to 226 and in 2003 increased 120 basis points to 206 compared with 2002 the increases are due to strong consumer demand positive home pricing favorable shifts in product and geographic mix the benefits of leveragebuy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management we consider land acquisition one of our core competencies we acquire land primarily for the construction of our homes for sale to homebuyers we will often sell select parcels of land within or adjacent to our communities to retail and commercial establishments we also will on occasion sell lots within our communities to other homebuilders gross profits from land sales were 998 million and 659 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively representing increases of 339 million and 129 million respectively from the previous years totals revenues and their related gainslosses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of land sales we continue to evaluate our existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of capital included in other assets is approximately 2301 million in land held for disposition as of december 31 2004 as compared to 2512 million and 2188 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues decreased 90 basis points to 88 compared with 2003 after increasing 20 basis points to 97 in 2003 compared with 2002 the improvement in 2004 can be attributed to greater leverage as a result of volume increases and the favorable pricing environment for our homes the increase in 2003 is principally attributable to costs associated with the realignment of our field operations and organizations to meet the challenge and opportunity for future growth equity income for 2004 includes earnings from our 50 investment in a joint venture that supplies and installs basic building components and operating systems acquired in january 2004 and two nevadabased joint ventures related to the sale of commercial and residential properties equity income for 2003 primarily includes earnings from the two nevadabased joint ventures other income expense net includes the writeoff of deposits and preacquisition costs resulting from decisions not to pursue certain land acquisitions and options insurancerelated expenses and settlements and other nonoperating expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in expense is due to larger writeoffs of deposit and preacquisition costs as we continue to evaluate potential land acquitions for the most effective use of capital 17 

homebuilding operations continued international homebuilding our international homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of international in mexico and puerto rico the following table presents selected financial data for our international homebuilding operations for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 000’s omitted  

 

 

international unit settlements for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 increased 12 and 9 respectively international revenues for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 increased 3 and 12 respectively over the prior year periods revenues increased for both years primarily due to increased unit closings in mexico our operations in puerto rico have experienced decreased unit closings and revenue as more of our business there has shifted to joint venture affiliates the higher proportion of unit settlements derived from mexico coupled with a higher percentage of those closings coming from economic housing which is the lowest price point served in mexico had a negative impact on gross margins in 2004 compared with 2003 gross margins decreased approximately 100 basis points to 192 for the year ended december 31 2004 for the year ended december 31 2003 gross margins were 202 an increase of 50 basis points compared with 2002 due to favorable product and geographic mix shifts in mexico selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased by 340 basis points to 145 in 2004 from 179 in 2003 and 173 in 2002 the increase from 2002 to 2003 was driven primarily by reorganization costs incurred during the restructuring of our operations in mexico in an effort to enhance future profitability while the improvement in 2004 reflects the benefits of the restructuring actions our operations in mexico are affected by fluctuations in currency rates for that country transaction gains and losses for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 classified as other income expense net were not significant for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of 781 thousand and a loss of 59 million respectively for mexico as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet for the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of 86 million for mexico at december 31 2004 our investment in puerto rico and mexico net of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments approximated 288 million and 722 million respectively 18 

financial services operations we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held generally less than four months we do not amortize the servicing asset since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts there are no impairment issues related to these assets we also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors the following table presents mortgage origination data for our financial services operations  

pretax income of our financial services operations was 474 million 688 million and 667 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 23 and 35 respectively over 2003 mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 24 and 32 respectively over 2002 this growth can be attributed to increases in the capture rate of 510 basis points to 878 in 2004 and 510 basis points to 827 in 2003 combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business our domestic homebuilding customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production representing 92 of pulte mortgage unit production for 2004 compared with 83 in 2003 and 85 in 2002 adjustable rate mortgages arms represented 43 of total funded origination dollars and 42 of total funded origination units for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 24 and 22 respectively in 2003 and 16 and 13 respectively in 2002 refinancings represented 3 of total loan production in 2004 compared with 8 in both 2003 and 2002 at december 31 2004 loan application backlog was 35 billion compared with 22 billion and 14 billion at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively pretax income decreased 31 for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 2003 as increased volume was offset by changes in product mix to arms which generally have a lower profit per loan than fixed rate products the shift to arms is attributable to customer mortgage product preference in addition in 2004 36 of total originations were brokered loans which are less profitable to us compared with 16 in 2003 mortgage origination fees increased to 205 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 75 million in 2003 due to the increase in brokered loans gains from the sale of mortgages during 2004 decreased 141 million or 22 from 644 million in 2003 and net interest income decreased 55 million to 97 million during 2004 as compared with 151 million in 2003 these decreases were due to the product mix shifts and an unfavorable interest rate environment in 2004 compared with 2003 income from our title operations was 176 million in 2004 an increase of 30 over 2003 our minority interest in su casita a mexican mortgage banking company contributed income of 4 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with 44 million in 2003 selling general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 41 to 575 million compared with 2003 due to increased origination volume pretax income for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 3 to 688 million as a result of increased volume partially offset by a less favorable interest rate environment for selling loans during the last six months of the year and an increase in training systems and facilities costs incurred in anticipation of the projected growth of the business gains from the sale of mortgages increased 20 million or 3 from the same period in 2002 as compared with 2002 net interest income increased 38 million to 151 million during 2003 due to increased production title income grew 11 contributing 135 million to pretax income for the year 19

interest expense net of interest capitalized into inventory increased 20 to 474 million in 2004 and 3 to 394 million in 2003 this trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth interest incurred for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations was approximately 2052 million 179 million and 1625 million respectively the increase in other corporate expenses net for the year ended december 31 2004 compared with the prior year was partially due to increased charitable contributions additionally during 2003 and 2002 we recognized income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various nonoperating parcels of commercial land held for sale other corporate expense net in 2003 increased 122 million compared with 2002 principally as a result of higher compensationrelated costs interest capitalized into inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities interest in inventory has increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the del webb properties which have a longer life cycle information related to corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows 000’s omitted

effective tax rate was 3765 compared to 38 in 2003 and 39 in 2002 the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2004 was principally due to the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters the reduction in the effective tax rate during 2003 was principally due to a lower than expected effective state income tax rate for 2003 and the shareholders’ approval of our new senior management annual incentive plan which allows full tax deductibility of plan payments under section 162m of the internal revenue service code we anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2005 will be approximately 38 our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 amounted to 6983 million compared with 3313 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the increases in net income for

critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these consolidated financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements giving due regard to materiality the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition   homebuilding – homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed we do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return   financial services – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance or a contracted set fee in the case of certain subservicing and are credited to income when related mortgage payments are received loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold inventory valuation our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value included in inventories are all direct development costs inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost unless they are determined to be impaired in which case these inventories are measured at fair value if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory adjustments may be required we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the cyclical timing of unit settlements sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis under the specific identification basis cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs and closing costs and commissions construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed 25 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued residential mortgage loans availableforsale residential mortgage loans availableforsale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold we hedge our residential mortgage loans availableforsale gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded certain intangible assets and goodwill most recently as a result of the del webb merger in 2001 intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure impairment based on one of three methods for assets related to ongoing operations we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows for assets to be disposed of we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets for goodwill we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations allowance for warranties home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate insurance the company has and requires the majority of its subcontractors to have general liability and workers compensation insurance these insurance policies protect the company against a portion of its risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits the company reserves for costs to cover its selfinsured and deductible amount under those policies and for any costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of its coverage limits or not covered by such policies based on an analysis of the company’s historical claims which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported the company’s total reserves for such items were 1156 million and 811 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively expenses related to such claims were approximately 584 million 409 million and 258 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively stockbased compensation we currently have several stockbased employee compensation plans effective january 1 2003 we adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stock issued to employees” we selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” under the prospective method we recognize compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the vesting period based on the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 grants made prior to january 1 2003 continue to be accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations with the exception of certain variable stock option grants no stockbased employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to january 1 2003 as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 26 

critical accounting policies and estimates continued stockbased compensation continued we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant the blackscholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields expected volatility riskfree interest rates and expected lives these assumptions reflect management’s best estimates but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control as a result if other assumptions had been used stockbased compensation expense could have been materially impacted furthermore if management uses different assumptions in future periods stockbased compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods on december 15 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment which amends sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation sfas no 123r requires that all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options be accounted for at fair value the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition under sfas no 123r we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption we previously adopted the fairvaluebased method of accounting for sharebased payments under sfas no 123 effective january 1 2003 using the prospective method described in sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure currently we use the blackscholes model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and we are considering the preferred lattice model because sfas no 123r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date and because we adopted sfas no 123 using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted modified or settled after the adoption date compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under sfas no 123 will be recognized under sfas no 123r sfas no 123r also amends sfas no 95 statement of cash flows to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid as originally issued sfas no 95 required all income tax payments to be classified as operating cash outflows this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are still evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 123r

pulte mortgage operating as a mortgage banker is also subject to interest rate risk interest rate risk begins when we commit to lend money to a customer at agreedupon terms ie commit to lend at a certain interest rate for a certain period of time the interest rate risk continues through the loan closing and until the loan is sold to an investor during 2004 and 2003 this period of interest rate exposure averaged approximately 60 days in periods of rising interest rates the length of exposure will generally increase due to customers locking in an interest rate sooner as opposed to letting the interest rate float we minimize interest rate risk by i financing the loans via a variable rate borrowing agreement tied to the federal funds rate and ii hedging our loan commitments and closed loans through derivative financial instruments these financial instruments include cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities whole loan investor commitments options on treasury future contracts and options on cash forward placement contracts on mortgagebacked securities we do not use any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes hypothetical changes in the fair values of our financial instruments arising from immediate parallel shifts in longterm mortgage rates of plus 50 100 and 150 basis points would not be material to our financial results at december 31 2004 our aggregate net investments exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk include our operations in mexico which approximated 722 million and our mortgage banking joint venture investment in mexico which approximated 211 million special notes concerning forwardlooking statements as a cautionary note except for the historical information contained herein certain matters discussed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  are “forwardlooking” statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “reform act” forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events words such as “anticipate” “expect” “intend” “plan” “believe” “seek” “estimate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with discussions of future operating or financial performance signify forwardlooking statements from time to time we also may provide oral or written forwardlooking statements in other materials released to the public such statements are made in good faith by us pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the reform act such forwardlooking statements involve known risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results performance or achievements to be materially different from our future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements such factors include among other things 1 general economic and business conditions 2 interest rate changes and the availability of mortgage financing 3 the relative stability of debt and equity markets 4 competition 5 the availability and cost of land and other raw materials used in our homebuilding operations 6 the availability and cost of insurance covering risks associated with our business 7 shortages and the cost of labor 8 weather related slowdowns 9 slow growth initiatives andor local building moratoria 10 state and federal governmental regulations including the interpretation of tax labor and environmental laws 11 changes in consumer confidence and preferences 12 required accounting changes 13 terrorist acts and other acts of war and 14 other factors over which we have little or no control 28

new orders orders for homes net of cancellations in any year are strongly influenced by local regional and national market economic conditions backlog homes that have been ordered but not completed and sold at any period is strongly influenced by local regional and national market economic conditions domestic homebuilding we build a wide variety of homes including single family detached units townhouses condominiums and duplexes with varying prices models options and lot sizes since 1990 we have more than quadrupled our annual unit closings unit orders and unit backlog levels including 2003 settlements of nearly 33000 homes we have closed more than 370000 homes since our inception on july 31 2001 we merged with del webb in a taxfree stockforstock transaction del webb was primarily a homebuilder with operations in seven states for the fiscal year ended june 30 2001 del webb reported net income of 912 million on revenues of 19 billion and 7038 unit settlements backlog reported at june 30 2001 was 3682 units valued at approximately 994 million this merger expanded and supported our leadership position in particular we believe the merger strengthened our position among active adult 55 and better homebuyers added important strategic land positions provided operational savings from economies of scale bolstered our purchasing leverage and enhanced our overall competitive position in accordance with our operational strategy we will continue to evaluate available strategic acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our longrange goals as of december 31 2003 our domestic homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 535 communities at sales prices ranging from 80000 to 2300000 sales prices of homes currently offered for sale in 75 of our communities fall within the range of 100000 to 350000 with a 2003 average unit selling price of 259000 sales of singlefamily detached homes as a percentage of total unit sales were 83 in 2003 86 in 2002 and 82 in 2001 our domestic homebuilding operations are geographically diverse and as a result better insulate us from demand changes in individual markets as of december 31 2003 our domestic homebuilding business operated in 44 markets spanning 27 states as of december 31 2003 our domestic homebuilding operations had 13952 units in backlog valued at approximately 41 billion international homebuilding our international homebuilding operations are principally conducted through subsidiaries of international in mexico puerto rico and argentina international homebuilding product offerings focus on the demand of firsttime buyers and middletoupper income consumer groups effective january 1 2002 international reorganized its structure within mexico to create a single company pulte mexico s de rl de cv which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country prior to the reorganization these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout mexico under the new ownership structure which combines the largest of these entities we own 638 of pulte mexico s de rl de cv and have consolidated pulte mexico s de rl de cv into our financial statements we are currently in the process of evaluating various longterm strategic alternatives with regard to our international operations 4 homebuilding operations continued land acquisition and development we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain active adult developments and our del webb operations for which the completion of community build out requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes as a result land is generally purchased after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities who construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2003 we controlled approximately 257000 lots of which 120000 were owned and 137000 were under option agreements sales and marketing we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer profiles segmentation analysis provides a method for understanding the business opportunities and risks across the full spectrum of consumer groups in each market once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group to meet the demands of our various domestic customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features in certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the sales price standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings appliances and a variety of available flooring and carpet typically our domestic sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including the customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the superintendent 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have great success with the firsttime buyer in the low to moderate price range in such cases financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company we also enjoy strong sales to the moveup buyer and in certain markets offer semicustom homes in higher price ranges as a result of the del webb merger we are better able to address the needs of active adults the fastest growing homebuying segment with destination communities offering highly amenitized products such as golf courses recreational centers and educational classes the active adult buyer has many options to maintain an active lifestyle 5 homebuilding operations continued sales and marketing continued in 2003 our dallas houston las vegas minneapolisst paul san francisco bay area phoenix raleighdurham sacramento southern california tampa tucson and palm beach markets were recognized for ranking the highest in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study the survey of twentyone u s markets noted customer service and home readiness as the two factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of satisfaction we ranked third or better in seventeen of the twentyone markets surveyed building on this quality foundation is our brand development program with our “three i’s on quality” involvement integrity and innovation platform developing the pulte homes brand and leveraging the strength of the “divosta” “del webb” and “sun city” tradenames helps to distinguish our communities from the competition and can often be rewarded with the advantages of additional sales pace choice community locations and reduced overall customer acquisition costs in addition our homeowner for life™ strategy and philosophy has increased our business from those who have previously owned a pulte home or have been referred by a pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home owning experience we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements and other advertising displays in addition our websites wwwpultecom wwwdelwebbcom and wwwdivostacom provide tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us approximately three million potential customers visited our websites during 2003 our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification of underserved market demand particularly in argentina and puerto rico with strong emphasis on quality initiatives and customer service in mexico where our product is focused largely on social interest housing sales and marketing efforts target areas experiencing population and employment industrialization growth construction the construction process for our domestic homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we believe that pulte preferred partnerships p 3  an extension of our quality assurance program continues to establish new standards for contractor relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and when possible by building on contiguous lots to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we leverage our size by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives housing in mexico and puerto rico consists primarily of reinforced poured concrete concrete and ceramic block andor brick construction with flat roofs and public water electric and sanitary system connections our housing product in argentina is designed and constructed in a similar fashion to our domestic product but is customized for local preferences building materials supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction work is performed by general contractors andor independent contractors which in many cases include both labor and materials we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future and have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets 6 homebuilding operations continued competition and other factors our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is highly competitive in each of our market areas there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete we also compete with the resales of existing house inventory any provider of housing units forsale or to rent including apartment builders may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in interest rates 3 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 4 various demographic factors 5 changes in federal income tax laws 6 changes in government mortgage financing programs and 7 availability of sufficient mortgage capacity in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state local and foreign governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration fha or veterans administration va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state local and foreign laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance financial services operations we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries mortgage banking our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our domestic homebuyers but also services the general public we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association gnma federal national mortgage association fnma federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma and fhlmc our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado using a mortgage operations center moc concept we also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center mac in denver our sales representatives who are the mortgage customers’ main contact forward the loan applications to a mac loan counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the moc for processing we believe both the moc and the mac improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to outside investors our capture rate for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 was approximately 83 78 and 74 respectively our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business during the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 we originated mortgage loans for approximately 73 68 and 67 respectively of the homes we sold domestically such originations represented 83 85 and 81 respectively of our originations we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time generally less than four months after the loan is originated which substantially reduces the risk of impairment with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the servicing sales contracts provide for the reimbursement of payments made when loans prepay within specified periods of time usually 90 days after sale or securitization 7 financial services operations continued mortgage banking continued the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our homebuyers and to the general public the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc in addition to being affected by changes in these programs our mortgage banking business is also affected by several of the same factors that impact our homebuilding business discontinued operations during the first quarter of 1994 we adopted a plan of disposal for first heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related mortgage banking first heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers the sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994 although in 1994 we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time contractual disputes with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic prevented the prepayment of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation resolution fund frf notes thereby precluding us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan to provide liquidity for the sale first heights liquidated its investment portfolios and its singlefamily residential loan portfolio and as provided in the assistance agreement entered into a liquidity assistance note lan with the fdic acting in its capacity as manager of the frf notes the lan was collateralized by the frf notes the lan and frf notes matured in september 1998 however payment of these obligations was withheld by both parties pending resolution of all open matters with the fdic as discussed in item 3 we settled the litigation with the fdic in october 2001 and as part of that settlement all obligations under the lan and frf notes were extinguished first heights’ daytoday activities are principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the united states government discussed in item 3 and are not reflective of the active operations of the former thrift such as maintaining traditional transaction accounts eg checking and savings accounts or making loans accordingly such operations are presented as discontinued corporate corporate is a nonoperating segment that is comprised primarily of pulte homes inc and pulte

than 10 of total domestic homebuilding settlement revenues settlement units or net new orders during the three years ended december 31 2003 14 homebuilding continued domestic homebuilding continued the following table presents selected unit information for our domestic homebuilding operations   unit settlements in 2003 reached a record high increasing 13 to 32693 units the increase in 2003 can be attributed to continued strong demand for new housing and an increase in the active communities to 535 from 460 unit settlements in 2002 increased 26 to 28903 units principally from the inclusion of a full year of del webb operations combined with strong sales in the midwest the average selling price for our homes increased from 225000 in 2001 to 242000 in 2002 and to 259000 in the current year changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors including price increases the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers both 2003 and 2002 benefited from increased product prices and improved product mix ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed climbed 32 to 13952 homes the dollar value of our ending backlog was up 45 to 41 billion at december 31 2003 unit and dollar backlog at december 31 2002 increased 22 and 35 respectively to 10605 homes valued at 29 billion overall strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and an increase in the number of active communities drove increased order activity and record levels of backlog 15 homebuilding continued domestic homebuilding continued the following table presents a summary of pretax income for our domestic homebuilding operations 000’s omitted   gross profit margins from home sales in 2003 increased 120 basis points over 2002 to 206 gross profit margins in 2002 increased 30 basis points to 194 factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand positive home pricing the benefits of leveragebuy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management in addition 2001 gross profit margins were negatively impacted 20 basis points as a result of purchase accounting adjustments land sales increased in each of the prior three years demonstrating our competency in purchasing developing and entitling certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders as well as to retail and commercial establishments revenues and their related gainslosses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of such sales we continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital included in other assets is approximately 2512 million in land held for disposition as of december 31 2003 as compared to 2188 million in the prior year for the year ended december 31 2003 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues increased 20 basis points to 97 after increasing 10 basis points to 95 in 2002 the increase in 2003 is principally attributable to costs associated with the realignment of our field operations and organizations to meet the challenge and opportunity for future growth higher startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the del webb operations contributed to the change in 2002 other income expense net totaled income of 34 million in 2003 compared to expense of 230 million in 2002 this favorable change was principally a result of equity earnings from two nevadabased joint ventures totaling 285 million related to the sale of commercial and residential properties other expense net of 169 million in 2001 benefited from income from certain nonoperating investments totaling 42 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 our domestic homebuilding operations controlled approximately 256900 and 176800 lots respectively approximately 120400 and 84300 lots were owned and approximately 66000 and 43800 lots were under option agreements approved for purchase at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively in addition there were approximately 70500 lots under option agreements at december 31 2003 pending approval that are under review and evaluation for future use by our domestic homebuilding operations this compared to 48700 lots at december 31 2002 the total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated 26 billion at december 31 2003 in addition total purchase price applicable to land under option pending approval was valued at 21 billion at december 31 2003 land option agreements which may be cancelled at our discretion may extend over several years and are secured by deposits totaling 990 million which are generally nonrefundable 16 homebuilding continued international homebuilding our international homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of international in mexico puerto rico and argentina effective january 1 2002 we reorganized the structure of our operations within mexico to create a single company pulte mexico s de rl de cv  which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country prior to the reorganization these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout mexico under the new ownership structure which combines the largest of these entities we own 638 of pulte mexico s de rl de cv and have consolidated pulte mexico s de rl de cv into our financial statements results for 2002 include joint venture operations for one month and operations as a consolidated entity for eleven months as the operations in mexico report on a onemonth lag we are currently in the process of evaluating various longterm strategic alternatives with regard to our international operations the following table presents selected financial data for our international homebuilding operations for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 000’s omitted   international revenues and unit settlements for 2003 benefited from a full year of results from our operations in mexico as well as increased sales in both argentina and puerto rico our mexico operations had revenues of 1723 million and unit settlements of 6777 for the year ended december 31 2003 increased revenues and settlements in 2002 were due to consolidation of the operations in mexico for eleven months of 2002 a full year of closings in argentina which recorded its first closing in june of 2001 partially offset by a decline in puerto rico our operations in mexico contributed revenues of 1581 million and unit settlements of 6271 units in 2002 gross profit margins from home sales declined 20 basis points to 197 in 2003 compared to 2002 as favorable product and geographic mix shifts in mexico were offset by less favorable product mix shifts in puerto rico and unfavorable sales pace in argentina the consolidation of mexico had a positive effect on 2002 gross margins increasing to 199 from 120 in 2001 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased by 60 basis points to 185 in 2003 from 179 in 2002 this increase was driven by additional costs incurred reorganizing our operations in mexico in an effort to enhance future profitability aggressive marketing efforts in argentina coupled with limited reorganization costs and a stronger peso also contributed to the increase our operations in argentina and mexico are affected by fluctuations in currency rates for those countries transaction gains and losses for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 classified as other income expense net were not significant for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we recorded a foreign currency translation gain of 19 million and a loss of 128 million respectively for argentina and a translation loss of 59 million and a gain of 86 million for mexico as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet at december 31 2003 our investment in argentina and mexico net of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments approximated 132 million and 658 million respectively 17 financial services we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held generally less than four months we do not amortize the servicing asset since the servicing rights are recorded based on the value in the servicing sales contracts there are no impairment issues related to these assets we also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors the following table presents mortgage origination data for our financial services operations  mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 24 and 32 respectively over 2002 this growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 510 basis points to 827 combined with the volume increases experienced in our homebuilding business and an increase in average loan size our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business mortgage origination principal volume in 2002 increased 28 over 2001 due to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 776 and the inclusion of del webb mortgage operations for a full year origination unit volume increased 21 due to the same factors our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production representing 83 of total pulte mortgage unit production for 2003 compared with 85 in 2002 and 81 in 2001 refinancings represented 8 of total loan production in 2003 and 2002 and 10 during 2001 at december 31 2003 loan application backlog increased 57 to 22 billion as compared to 14 billion and 08 billion at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively pretax income for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 3 to 688 million as a result of increased volume partially offset by the impact of a less favorable interest rate environment for selling loans during the last six months of the year and an increase in training systems and facilities costs incurred in anticipation of the projected growth of the business gains from the sale of mortgages increased 20 million or 3 from the same period in 2002 as compared with 2002 net interest income increased 38 million to 151 million during 2003 due to increased production income from our title operations was 135 million in 2003 an increase of 11 over 2002 pretax income for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 81 to 667 million as a result of increased volume a favorable interest rate environment effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of del webb mortgage operations for a full year gains from the sale of mortgages increased 204 million or 49 from the same period in 2001 as compared with 2001 net interest income increased 63 million to 113 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002 title income grew 42 contributing 122 million to pretax income for the year we hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments for the year ended december 31 2003 we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to an ineffective portion of the hedging instrument we also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2003 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur at december 31 2003 we expect to reclassify 02 million net of taxes of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans 18 corporate corporate is a nonoperating segment that supports the operations of our subsidiaries by acting as the internal source of financing developing and implementing strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and providing the necessary administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity listed on the new york stock exchange as a result the corporate segment’s operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve the following table presents this segment’s results of operations 000’s omitted  interest expense net of interest capitalized into inventory increased 3 to 394 million in 2003 and 12 to 382 million in 2002 this trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth interest incurred for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations was approximately 1790 million 1625 million and 1169 million respectively other corporate expense net in 2003 increased 122 million principally as a result of higher compensationrelated costs over the twoyear period ended december 31 2002 other corporate expenses net were relatively flat as higher compensationrelated costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various nonoperating parcels of commercial land held for sale interest capitalized into inventory is charged to home cost of sales based on the cyclical timing of our unit settlements over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities interest in inventory has increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the del webb properties which have a longer life cycle information related to corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows 000’s omitted  discontinued operations during the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 we recorded noncash aftertax gains of 79 million and 100 million respectively related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters relating to our thrift operation first heights bank fsb first heights which we discontinued in 1994 in september 2003 the united states court of federal claims issued final judgment that pulte homes inc pulte diversified companies inc and first heights collectively the pulte parties had been damaged by approximately 487 million as a result of the united states government’s breach of contract with them the final judgment follows the court’s august 17 2001 ruling that the united states breached the contract related to the pulte parties’ 1988 acquisition of five savings and loan associations by enacting section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 the united states government and the pulte parties filed notices of appeal with the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in october 2003 accordingly any gain related to this litigation will be recognized only upon final resolution 19 liquidity and capital resources our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 totaled 3018 million the increase in net income was offset by significant investments in land necessary to support the continued growth of the business net cash used in investing activities was 341 million for 2003 net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2003 was 1289 million reflecting proceeds from the 300 million senior notes issued in february and the 400 million senior notes issued in may and proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repayment of debt dividends paid and stock repurchases our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 1488 million the increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business net cash provided by investing activities was 215 million for 2002 net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 3740 million reflecting proceeds from the 300 million senior notes issued in june 2002 proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repayment of debt dividends paid and stock repurchases we finance our homebuilding land acquisitions development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements effective october 1 2003 we replaced our 570 million revolving credit facility with an 850 million facility that includes the capacity to issue letters of credit up to 500 million this new credit facility expires october 1 2008 we had no borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility at december 31 2003 pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements pulte mortgage has committed credit arrangements of 860 million comprised of a 310 million bank revolving credit facility and a 550 million annual assetbacked commercial paper program there were approximately 4793 million of borrowings outstanding under existing pulte mortgage arrangements at december 31 2003 mortgage loans originated by pulte mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors we anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes in february 2003 we sold 300 million of 625 unsecured senior notes due 2013 proceeds from this issuance were used to retire our 175 million 95 senior notes that matured on april 1 2003 and redeem the remaining outstanding principal balance of approximately 155 million of del webb’s 200 million 9375 senior subordinated notes due 2009 that were called for redemption in march at a price equal to 104688 of the principal amount in may 2003 we sold 400 million of 6375 unsecured senior notes due 2033 proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes and to retire our 100 million 7 senior notes that matured on december 15 2003 in december 2003 we increased our dividend 150 to 05 per share from 02 per share pursuant to our 100 million share repurchase program we repurchased 790800 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 182 million during 2003 and 200000 common shares for approximately 43 million in 2002 at december 31 2003 we had remaining authorization to purchase common stock aggregating 775 million our income tax liability and related effective tax rate are affected by a number of factors in 2003 our effective tax rate was 380 compared to 390 in 2002 and 385 in 2001 the reduction in the effective tax rate for 2003 is principally due to a lower expected effective state income tax rate for 2003 and the shareholders’ approval of our new senior management annual incentive plan which will allow for full tax deductibility of plan payments under section 162m of the internal revenue service code we anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2004 will be approximately 38 at december 31 2003 we had cash and equivalents of 4041 million 21 billion of unsecured senior notes and 773 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling 833 million sources of our working capital at december 31 2003 include cash and equivalents our 850 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and pulte mortgage’s 860 million revolving credit facilities our debttototal capitalization excluding our collateralized debt was 384 as of december 31 2003 and 336 net of cash and equivalents we expect to maintain our net debttototal capitalization at or below the 40 level in january 2004 we sold 500 million of 525 senior notes due 2014 proceeds from the sale will be used to retire the del webb 1025 subordinated debentures called for redemption and for general corporate purposes including continued investment in our business 20 liquidity and capital resources continued inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation also increases our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2003   the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2003   offbalance sheet arrangements we use standby letters of credit and performance bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related projects if the obligations related to a project are ongoing annual extensions of the letters of credit are typically granted on a yeartoyear basis at december 31 2003 we had outstanding letters of credit of 2152 million performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 12 billion at december 31 2003 are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 35 years we do not believe that we will be required to draw upon any such letters of credit or performance bonds 21 offbalance sheet arrangements continued in the ordinary course of business we enter into land option or option type agreements in order to procure land for the construction of houses in the future at december 31 2003 these agreements totaled approximately 47 billion pursuant to these land option agreements we provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future usually at predetermined prices if the entity holding the land under option is a variable interest entity our deposit represents a variable interest in that entity at december 31 2003 we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets totaling 733 million we currently do not have any nonconsolidated special purpose entity arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition   homebuilding – homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed we do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return   financial services – mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold inventory valuation our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated costs or net realizable value included in inventories are all direct development costs inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost unless they are determined to be impaired in which case these inventories are measured at fair value if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory adjustments may be required we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories interest capitalized each quarter is identified as a separate layer in our capitalized interest balance sheet pool each layer of capitalized interest is amortized over a period that approximates the average life of communities under development interest expense is allocated to the quarters over the amortization period based on the historical relationship of unit settlements in a quarter compared to annual unit settlements this period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the del webb properties which have a longer life cycle and could change in the future as the mix of communities change sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis under the specific identification basis cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs and closing costs and commissions construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed 22 critical accounting policies and estimates continued residential mortgage loans availableforsale residential mortgage loans availableforsale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold we hedge our residential mortgage loans availableforsale gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans goodwill and intangible assets we have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill most recently as a result of the del webb merger in 2001 intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames were valued using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure impairment based on one of three methods for assets related to ongoing operations we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows for assets to be disposed of we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets for goodwill we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations allowance for warranties home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim we periodically assess the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate stockbased compensation we currently have several stockbased employee compensation plans effective january 1 2003 we adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 “accounting for stock issued to employees” we selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” under the prospective method we will recognize compensation expense based on the fair value provisions of sfas no 123 for all new stock option grants effective january 1 2003 grants made prior to january 1 2003 will continue to be accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations with the exception of certain variable stock option grants no stockbased employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for grants made prior to january 1 2003 as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant the blackscholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields expected volatility riskfree interest rates and expected lives these assumptions reflect management’s best estimates but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control as a result if other assumptions had been used stockbased compensation expense could have been materially impacted furthermore if management uses different assumptions in future periods stockbased compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 23

million on revenues of 19 billion and 7038 unit settlements backlog reported at june 30 2001 was 3682 units valued at approximately 994 million this merger expanded and supported our leadership position in particular we believe the merger strengthened our position among active adult homebuyers added important strategic land positions provided operational savings from economies of scale bolstered our purchasing leverage and enhanced our overall competitive position in accordance with our operational strategy we will continue to evaluate available strategic acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our longrange goals as of december 31 2002 our domestic homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 460 communities at sales prices ranging from 85000 to 1391000 sales

multinational corporations to provide employee housing in mexico   mexico effective january 1 2002 international reorganized its structure within mexico to create a single company pulte mexico s de rl de cv pulte mexico which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country prior to the reorganization these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout mexico under the new ownership structure which combines the largest of these entities we own 638 of pulte mexico and have consolidated pulte mexico into our financial statements the new operating structure facilitates growth enables operating leverage and improves efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures   puerto rico our operations in puerto rico are conducted through international’s 100owned subsidiary pulte international caribbean corporation and three joint ventures   argentina our operations in argentina which are based in the greater buenos aires area are conducted through pulte srl international’s 100owned argentine subsidiary  land acquisition and development we select locations for development of homebuilding communities after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group we consider factors such as proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we historically have managed the risk of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 to 36 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain activeadult developments and our del webb operations for which the completion of community build out requires a longer time period due to typically larger project sizes as a result land is generally controlled after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business through sales to appropriate end users where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by independent contractors and local government authorities which construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2002 we controlled approximately 176800 lots of which 84300 were owned and 92500 were under option agreements sales and marketing we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer profiles once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group to meet the demands of our various domestic customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features in certain markets our strategy is to offer “the complete house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the sales price standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings appliances and a variety of available flooring and carpet 5 homebuilding operations continued sales and marketing continued typically our domestic sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for guiding the customer through the sales process we are committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including the customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the superintendent 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have great success with the firsttime buyer in the low to moderate price range in such cases financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company we also enjoy strong sales to the moveup buyer and in certain markets offer semicustom homes in higher price ranges in 2002 our charlotte houston las vegas minneapolisst paul phoenix san francisco bay area and southern california markets were recognized for ranking the highest in their markets in a national customer satisfaction study the survey of sixteen us markets noted customer service and home readiness as the two factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of satisfaction we finished third or better in twelve of the sixteen markets surveyed building on this quality foundation is our brand development program with our “three i’s on quality” platform developing the pulte homes brand and leveraging the strength of the “divosta” “del webb” and “sun city” names not only distinguishes our communities from the competition but often earns a price premium in the marketplace reduces overall customer acquisition costs and can result in additional sales in addition our homeowner for life™ strategy and philosophy has increased our business from those who have previously owned a pulte home or have been referred by a pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home owning experience we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements and other advertising displays in addition our newly redesigned website wwwpultecom provides tools to help users find a home that meets their needs investigate financing alternatives communicate moving plans maintain a home learn more about us and communicate directly with us approximately three million potential customers visited wwwpultecom during 2002 as a result of the del webb merger we are better able to address the needs of active adults the fastest growing homebuying segment with destination communities offering highly amenitized products such as golf courses recreational centers and educational classes the active adult buyer has many options to maintain an active lifestyle our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification of regions in mexico puerto rico and argentina which are experiencing population and industrial growth in mexico and puerto rico the demand for affordable and social interest housing is strong in mexico we have several agreements with large companies in mexico including delphi automotive systems and centrol comerciales soriana s a de cv to construct affordable housing for their employees in puerto rico the strongest customer demand is for singlefamily detached homes but affordable alternative product offerings also include two story attached units townhomes the market in argentina offers low levels of competition and a large residential market in buenos aires construction the construction process for our domestic homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by independent contractors under contracts that in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we believe that pulte preferred partnerships p3 an extension of our quality assurance program continues to establish new standards for contractor relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes 6 homebuilding operations continued construction continued we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and when possible by building on contiguous lots to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the contracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials generally is negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we utilize the leverage our size affords by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize production component cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives housing in mexico and puerto rico consists primarily of reinforced poured concrete concrete and ceramic block andor brick construction with flat roofs and public water electric and sanitary system connections our housing product in argentina is designed and constructed in a similar fashion to our domestic product but is customized for local preferences building materials supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction work is performed by general contractors andor independent contractors which in many cases include both labor and materials we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future and have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets competition and other factors our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is highly competitive in each of our market areas there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete any provider of housing units forsale or to rent including apartment builders may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design location and quality of our homes the housing industry is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in interest rates 3 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 4 various demographic factors 5 changes in federal income tax laws and 6 changes in government mortgage financing programs in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by shifts in demand for new homes our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state local and foreign governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration fha or veterans administration va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state local and foreign laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance financial services operations we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries mortgage banking our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our domestic homebuyers but also services the general public we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association gnma federal national mortgage association fnma federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma and fhlmc 7 financial services operations continued mortgage banking continued our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado using a mortgage operations center moc concept we also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center mac in denver our sales representatives who are the mortgage customers’ main contact forward the loan applications to a mac loan counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the moc for processing we believe both the moc and the mac improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to outside investors during the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 we originated mortgage loans for approximately 68 67 and 56 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented 85 81 and 83 respectively of our originations we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time usually three to four months after the loan is originated which substantially reduces impairment issues with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our homebuyers and to the general public in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors discontinued operations during the first quarter of 1994 we adopted a plan of disposal for first heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related mortgage banking first heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers the sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994 although in 1994 we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time contractual disputes with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic prevented the prepayment of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation resolution fund frf notes thereby precluding us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan to provide liquidity for the sale first heights liquidated its investment portfolios and its singlefamily residential loan portfolio and as provided in the assistance agreement entered into a liquidity assistance note lan with the fdic acting in its capacity as manager of the frf notes the lan was collateralized by the frf notes the lan and frf notes matured in september 1998 however payment of these obligations was withheld by both parties pending resolution of all open matters with the fdic as discussed in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements we settled the litigation with the fdic in october 2001 and as part of that settlement all obligations under the lan and frf notes were extinguished first heights’ daytoday activities are principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the united states government and are not reflective of the active operations of the former thrift such as maintaining traditional transaction accounts eg checking and savings accounts or making loans accordingly such operations are presented as discontinued 8 corporate corporate is a nonoperating segment that is comprised primarily of pulte and pdci both of which are holding companies the primary purpose of corporate is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal

mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is based on the performance of the applicable business unit or subsidiary our corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on overall performance of the company see note 8 of notes to

 item 3 legal proceedings we are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing business operations we believe that none of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations our financial position or our cash flows first heightsrelated litigation we were a party to three lawsuits relating to first heights’ 1988 acquisition from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic and first heights’ ownership of five failed texas thrifts the first lawsuit the “district court case” was filed on july 7 1995 in the united states district court eastern district of michigan by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic against pulte pdci and first heights collectively the “pulte parties” the second lawsuit the “court of federal claims case” was filed on december 26 1996 in the united states court of federal claims washington dc by the pulte parties against the united states the third lawsuit was filed by first heights on january 10 2000 in the united states district court eastern district of michigan against the fdic regarding the amounts including interest the fdic was obligated to pay first heights on two promissory notes which had been executed by the fdic’s predecessor the fslic 9 item 3 legal proceedings continued first heightsrelated litigation continued in the district court case the fdic as successor to the fslic sought a declaration of rights and other relief related to the assistance agreement entered into between first heights and the fslic the fdic and the pulte parties disagreed about the proper interpretation of provisions in the assistance agreement which provide for sharing of certain tax benefits achieved in connection with first heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of the five failed texas thrifts the district court case also included certain other claims relating to the foregoing including claims resulting from the company’s and first heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation agreement between the company and first heights the pulte parties disputed the fdic’s claims and filed an answer and a counterclaim seeking among other things a declaration that the fdic had breached the assistance agreement in numerous respects on december 24 1996 the pulte parties voluntarily dismissed without prejudice certain of their claims in the district court case and on december 26 1996 initiated the court of federal claims case in october 2001 the fdic and the pulte parties settled the district court case the related appeal to the sixth circuit court of appeals and the third lawsuit as part of this settlement the “settlement” the first heights assistance agreement was terminated except that certain tax benefit sharing provisions will continue in effect and the warrants issued by first heights to the fdic were extinguished we do not believe that the claims in the court of federal claims case are in any way prejudiced by the settlement in the court of federal claims case the pulte parties assert breaches of contract on the part of the united states in connection with the enactment of section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 “obra” that provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the pulte parties claim they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed texas thrifts the pulte parties also assert another claim concerning the contract that the united states through the fdic as receiver improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ preacquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in an effort to deprive the pulte parties of tax benefits for which they had contracted on august 17 2001 the united states court of federal claims ruled that the united states government is liable to the company for breach of contract by enacting section 13224 of obra the court is proceeding to determine the amount of damages to which the pulte parties are entitled while it is unclear at this time what amount the court will award the pulte parties are currently seeking approximately 80 million in after tax damages for the united states government’s breach of contract 10

unit settlements in 2002 reached a record high increasing 26 to 28903 units a full year of the del webb operations combined with strong sales in the midwest drove the increase 2001 unit settlements increased 16 to 22915 units principally from the addition of the del webb operations the average selling price for our homes increased from 206000 in 2000 to 225000 in 2001 and to 242000 in the current year changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors including price increases the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers both 2002 and 2001 benefited from increased product prices improved product mix and the inclusion of del webb product offerings which had an average selling price higher than our traditional offerings ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed climbed 22 to 10605 homes the dollar value of our ending backlog was up 35 to 29 billion at december 31 2002 unit and dollar backlog at december 31 2001 increased 58 and 62 respectively to 8678 homes valued at 21 billion overall strong demand supported by a favorable interest rate environment and the addition of del webb operations

excluding purchase accounting adjustments over 2000 gross margins factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand positive home pricing the benefits of leveragebuy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management land sales increased in each of the prior three years demonstrating our competency in purchasing developing and entitling certain land positions for sale primarily to other homebuilders as well as to retail and commercial establishments revenues and their related gainslosses may vary significantly between periods depending on the timing of such sales we continue to rationalize certain existing land positions to ensure the most effective use of invested capital for the year ended december 31 2002 selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home settlement revenues increased 13 basis points to 950 after increasing 42 basis points to 937 in 2001 higher startup costs for new communities and increased compensation related costs partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the del webb operations contributed to the change in 2002 the increase in 2001 reflects higher startup costs for new communities increased compensation related costs local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of del webb operations 17 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued homebuilding continued domestic homebuilding continued interest expense increased 127 million to 487 million in 2002 and 80 million to 360 million in 2001 the increases are a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support the growth of the business other expense net increased to 230 million in 2002 primarily as a result of income from certain nonoperating investments recorded in 2001 the increase from 2000 to 2001 represents an increase in land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with del webb at december 31 2002 and 2001 our domestic homebuilding operations controlled approximately 176800 and 141100 lots respectively approximately 84300 and 81200 lots were owned and approximately 43800 and 34800 lots under option agreements approved for purchase at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively in addition there were approximately 48700 lots under option agreements at december 31 2002 pending approval that are under review and evaluation for future use by our domestic homebuilding operations this compared to 25100 lots at december 31 2001 domestic homebuilding inventory at december 31 2002 was approximately 41 billion of which 32 billion related to land and land development at december 31 2001 inventory was approximately 38 billion of which 28 billion related to land and land development included in other assets is approximately 2188 million in land held for disposition as of december 31 2002 as compared to 2235 million in the prior year international homebuilding our international homebuilding operations are primarily conducted through subsidiaries of international in mexico puerto rico and argentina   mexico effective january 1 2002 international reorganized its structure within mexico to create a single company pulte mexico s de rl de cv pulte mexico which ranks as one of the largest builders in the country prior to the reorganization these operations were conducted primarily through five joint ventures throughout mexico under the new ownership structure which combines the largest of these entities we own 638 of pulte mexico and have consolidated pulte mexico into our financial statements the new operating structure facilitates growth enables operating leverage and improves efficiencies through standardized systems and procedures   puerto rico operations in puerto rico are conducted through international’s 100owned subsidiary pulte international caribbean corporation and three joint ventures   argentina operations in argentina which are based in the greater buenos aires area are conducted through pulte srl international’s 100owned argentine subsidiary 18 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued homebuilding continued international homebuilding continued the following table presents selected financial data for our international homebuilding operations for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 000’s omitted  unit settlements for pulte and pulteaffiliated entities in 2002 were relatively flat as compared to 2001 and down in 2001 when compared to 2000 as declines in puerto rico and mexico were only partially offset by settlements in argentina which approached 200 in 2002 settlements in mexico were 7166 in 2002 compared to 7158 in 2001 and 7718 in 2000 activity in mexico continues to be slowed by the impact of changes made in 2001 and 2002 to local lending practices and the lack of alternative funding sources increased revenues in 2002 are due to consolidation of the operations in mexico for eleven months of 2002 a full year of operations in argentina which had only begun recognizing its first closings in june of 2001 partially offset by a decline in puerto rico revenues from our operations in mexico were 1581 million in 2002 our operations in argentina contributed 259 million compared to 95 million in the prior year revenues in puerto rico were down to 121 million from 255 million the consolidation of mexico also had a positive effect on gross margins which rose to 199 in 2002 from 120 in 2001 and 94 in 2000 selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined as a result of a reduction in startup costs associated with our operations in argentina equity in income of joint ventures in 2002 represents one month of the joint venture operations in mexico and our joint venture located in canovanas puerto rico which had its first closings during the third quarter of 2001 our operations in argentina recorded transaction losses of 208000 and 463000 for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively as the value of the argentine peso continued to fluctuate following the argentine government’s decision to delink its valuation from the us dollar we also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 128 million as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income during 2002 it remains unclear at this time how the financial and currency markets in argentina will be impacted in 2003 or how the current economic situation may affect customer home buying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general at december 31 2002 our investment net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments in argentina approximated 131 million our operations in mexico have also been affected by a strengthening dollar to the mexican peso where transaction losses of 483000 378000 and 78000 were recorded in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively at december 31 2002 our investment net of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments in mexico approximated 611 million 19 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial services we conduct our financial services business which includes mortgage and title operations through pulte mortgage and other subsidiaries we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held usually three to four months we do not amortize the servicing asset since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts there are no impairment issues related to these assets we also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors the following table presents mortgage origination data for our financial services operations  mortgage origination unit and principal volume for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 21 and 28 respectively over 2001 this growth can be attributed to an increase in the capture rate of 390 basis points to 776 and the inclusion of del webb mortgage operations for a full year our capture rate represents loan originations from our homebuilding business as a percent of total loan opportunities excluding cash settlements from our homebuilding business mortgage origination principal volume in 2001 increased 50 over 2000 due to an increase in the capture rate of 950 basis points to 737 an increased average loan size and the inclusion of del webb mortgage operations which accounted for approximately 13 of the increase origination unit volume increased 42 due to the same factors our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production representing 85 of total pulte mortgage unit production for 2002 compared with 81 in 2001 and 83 in 2000 refinancings represented 8 of total loan production in 2002 compared with 10 in 2001 and 2 during 2000 at december 31 2002 loan application backlog increased 66 to 14 billion as compared to 827 million and 536 million at december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively pretax income for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 81 to 667 million as a result of increased volume a favorable interest rate environment effective leverage of overhead costs and the inclusion of del webb mortgage operations for a full year gains from the sale of mortgages increased 204 million or 49 from the same period in 2001 as compared with 2001 net interest income increased 63 million to 113 million during 2002 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2002 title income grew 42 contributing 122 million to pretax income for the year pretax income for the year ended december 31 2001 increased 49 to 369 million due to increases in volume capture rate and secondary marketing gains the addition of del webb mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8 of this increase pricing and marketing gains increased 174 million or 71 from the same period in 2000 primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001 as compared with 2000 net interest income increased 31 million to 50 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001 offsetting these gains was an increase in sga expenses of 10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001 income from our title operations increased 48 to 86 million in 2001 further fueling the growth in our financial services business 20 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial services continued we hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments for the year ended december 31 2002 we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness we also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2002 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur at december 31 2002 we expect to reclassify 13 million net of taxes of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans corporate corporate is a nonoperating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity as a result the corporate segment’s operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve the following table presents this segment’s results of operations 000’s omitted  interest expense net of interest capitalized into inventory increased 12 to 382 million in 2002 and 18 to 343 million in 2001 this trend is a result of an increase in debt levels necessary to support our growth interest incurred for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations was approximately 1625 1169 and 628 million respectively other corporate expense net over the twoyear period ended december 31 2002 was relatively flat as higher compensation related costs were offset by income from the sale and adjustment to fair value of various nonoperating parcels of commercial land held for sale the decrease in other corporate expenses net in 2001 when compared to 2000 is primarily due to the writedown of commercial land held for sale in 2000 interest capitalized into inventory is charged to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities interest in inventory at december 31 2002 increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the del webb properties which have a longer life cycle information related to corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows 000’s omitted  21 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2002 amounted to 1622 million the increase in net income was aided by the realization of certain tax benefits and an increase in accrued liabilities while inventories continued to build to support the growth of the business net cash provided by investing activities was 46 million for 2002 net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 3742 million reflecting proceeds from the 300 million senior notes issued in june 2002 proceeds from borrowings under our various credit facilities and proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repayment of debt dividends paid and stock repurchases our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2001 was 4188 million as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans availableforsale over 2000 and the resolution of the first heights litigation net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from del webb net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was 2971 million as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of 200 million and 500 million and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of higherrate debt acquired from del webb we finance our homebuilding land acquisitions development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements we had no borrowings under our 570 million unsecured revolving credit facility at december 31 2002 pulte mortgage provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available pursuant to various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements totaling 600 million an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs there were approximately 560 million of borrowings outstanding at december 31 2002 under the 600 million pulte mortgage arrangements mortgage loans originated by pulte mortgage are subsequently sold to outside investors we anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes in june 2002 we sold 300 million of 7875 senior notes due 2032 from our 1 billion shelf registration cash provided by operations combined with the net proceeds from this sale of senior notes were used to call redeem and repurchase approximately 103 million of del webb senior subordinated notes and to repay shortterm borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements in october 2002 our operating entity in argentina entered into a 3 million revolving credit facility in order to provide an additional financial resource to support the operations pulte homes inc has guaranteed the credit facility there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december 31 2002 in october 2002 the company’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan of up to 100 million shares will be purchased from timetotime on the open market depending on market conditions during the year ended december 31 2002 we repurchased 100000 shares for approximately 43 million our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors in 2002 our effective tax rate was 390 compared to 385 in 2001 and 2000 we anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2003 will be approximately 390 22 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued at december 31 2002 we had cash and equivalents of 6132 million 17 billion of unsecured senior notes and 2607 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes other financing includes limited recourse collateralized financing totaling 1455 million the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2002  the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2002  standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project if the obligations related to the project are ongoing annual extensions are granted on a yeartoyear basis performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 954 million at december 31 2002 are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 35 years in the normal course of business we acquire rights under options or optiontype agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates these rights which may be cancelled at our discretion may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits further these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations the total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated 15 billion at december 31 2002 which represented approximately 43800 lots in addition there were approximately 48700 lots valued at 982 million under option at december 31 2002 pending approval that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations sources of our working capital at december 31 2002 include cash and equivalents our 570 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility and pulte mortgage’s 600 million revolving credit our debttototal capitalization excluding our collateralized debt was approximately 41 as of december 31 2002 and approximately 32 net of cash and equivalents we expect to maintain our net debttototal capitalization at or below the 40 level 23 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued in february 2003 we sold 300 million of 625 senior notes due 2013 from the company’s current shelf registration proceeds from the sale will be used to retire certain debt coming due or called in 2003 subsequent to this issuance we had 400 million remaining available under the current mixed securities shelf registration inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation also increases our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition homebuilding — homebuilding revenues are recorded when the sales of homes are completed and ownership has transferred to the customer unfunded settlements are deposits in transit on homes for which the sale was completed we do not engage in arrangements whereby we have ongoing relationships with our homebuyers that require us to repurchase our homes or provide homebuyers with the right of return financial services — mortgage servicing fees represent fees earned for servicing loans for various investors servicing fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance and are credited to income when the related mortgage payments are received loan origination fees commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred as an adjustment to the cost of the related mortgage loan until such loan is sold gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold inventory valuation our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value included in inventories are all direct development costs we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities this period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the del webb properties which have a longer life cycle inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost unless they are determined to be impaired in which case these inventories are measured at fair value if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory adjustments may be required sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis under the specific identification basis cost of sales includes the construction cost of the home an average lot cost by project based on land acquisition and development costs and closing costs and commissions construction cost of the home includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home plus an accrual for costs incurred but not yet paid based on an analysis of budgeted construction cost this accrual is reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing compared to the amount accrued and adjustments are made if needed total project land acquisition and development costs are based on an analysis of budgeted costs compared to actual costs incurred to date and estimates to complete adjustments to estimated total project land acquisition and development costs for the project affect the amount of future lots costed 24 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued residential mortgage loans availableforsale residential mortgage loans availableforsale are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market value gains and losses from sales of mortgage loans are recognized when the loans are sold we hedge our residential mortgage loans availableforsale gains and losses from closed commitments and futures contracts are matched against the related gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans goodwill and intangible assets we have identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill most recently as a result of the del webb merger in 2001 intangible assets primarily trademarks and tradenames were valued by independent appraisers and advisors using proven valuation procedures and are amortized over their estimated useful life goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use if our expectations of future results and cash flows decrease significantly intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets longlived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment we measure impairment based on one of two methods for assets related to ongoing operations we plan to continue we use a projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine if impairment exists and then measure impairment using discounted cash flows for assets to be disposed of we assess the fair value of the asset based on current market conditions for similar assets for goodwill we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control changes in these estimates could result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and material charges to the results of operations investments in unconsolidated entities we participate in a number of joint ventures with independent third parties in which we have less than a controlling interest these joint ventures purchase develop andor sell land and homes in the united states mexico and puerto rico we recognize our share of profits from the sale of lots and homes to other buyers we do not recognize profits from lots we purchase but instead defer those profits until the related homes are sold at december 31 2002 we had approximately 490 million invested in these joint ventures under certain arrangements future capital contributions may be necessary to maintain our ownership in the joint venture we have not guaranteed any of the outstanding debt of the joint ventures at december 31 2002 which approximated 1032 million we also own 222 of the capital stock of a mortgage banking company in mexico at december 31 2002 our investment in this entity was approximately 158 million we do not have any purchase or investment commitments to this entity furthermore we have not guaranteed any of the indebtedness of this entity which approximated 12 billion at december 31 2002 these investments are accounted for on the equity method allowance for warranties home purchasers are provided with warranties against certain building defects the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary geographically most warranties cover different aspects of the home’s construction and operating systems for a period of up to ten years we estimate the costs to be incurred under these warranties and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of homes sold historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim we periodically assesses the adequacy of recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary although we have not made significant adjustments to the accrual in the past actual warranty cost in the future could differ from our current estimate 25

evaluate available strategic acquisition opportunities that coincide with our longrange goals as of december 31 2001 our domestic homebuilding operations offered homes for sale in 440 communities at

100owned argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001 land acquisition and development locations for development of homebuilding communities are selected after completing extensive market research enabling us to match the location and product offering with our targeted consumer group factors considered include proximity to developed areas population and job growth patterns and if applicable estimated development costs we have historically managed the risk of controlling our land positions through use of option contracts and outright acquisition we typically control land with the intent to complete sales of housing units within 24 months from the date of opening a community except in the case of certain activeadult developments and our del webb operations for which the completion of housing unit sales require a longer time period as a result land is generally controlled after it is properly zoned and developed or is ready for development in addition we dispose of owned land not required in the business where we develop land we engage directly in many phases of the development process including land and site planning obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals as well as constructing roads sewers water and drainage facilities and other amenities we use our staff and the services of independent engineers and consultants for land development activities land development work is performed primarily by subcontractors and local government authorities which construct sewer and water systems in some areas at december 31 2001 we owned approximately 82400 lots and had approximately 35000 lots under option sales and marketing we are dedicated to improving the quality and value of our domestic homes through innovative proprietary architectural and community designs and stateoftheart customer marketing techniques analyzing various qualitative and quantitative data obtained through extensive market research we segment our potential customers into welldefined buyer profiles once the demands of potential buyers are understood we link our home design and community development efforts to the specific lifestyle of each targeted consumer group 5 homebuilding operations continued sales and marketing continued to meet the demands of our various domestic customers we have established a solid design expertise for a wide array of product lines we believe that we are an innovator in the design of our homes and we view design capacity as an integral aspect of our marketing strategy our inhouse architectural services teams and management supplemented by outside consultants are successful in creating distinctive design features both in exterior facades and interior options and features a strategy in certain markets is to offer “the complete house” in which all features shown in the home are included in the sales price standard features typically offered include vaulted ceilings appliances and a selection of flooring and carpet which the buyer chooses typically our own domestic sales teams together with outside sales brokers are responsible for managing the customer through the sales process we have been committed to industryleading customer service through a variety of quality initiatives including the customer care program which ensures that homeowners are comfortable at every stage of the building process using a sevenstep interactive process homeowners are kept informed during their homebuilding and home owning experience the steps include 1 a preconstruction meeting with the superintendent 2 predry wall frame walk 3 quality assurance inspection 4 first homeowner orientation 5 30day followup after the close of the home 6 threemonth followup and 7 an 11month quality list after the close of the home fully furnished and landscaped model homes are used to showcase our homes and their distinctive design features we have great success with the firsttime buyer in the low to moderate price range in such cases financing under united states governmentinsured and guaranteed programs is often used and is facilitated through our mortgage company we also enjoy strong sales to the moveup buyer and in certain markets offer semicustom homes in higher price ranges in 2001 jd power and associates recognized our colorado charlotte las vegas and southern california markets for ranking the highest in their markets in customer satisfaction in the jd power and associates 2001 new home builder customer satisfaction studysm the survey of ten us markets noted customer service and home readiness as the two factors that most heavily influenced the customer’s overall level of satisfaction we finished third or better in seven of the ten markets surveyed building on this quality foundation is our brand development program with our “three i’s on quality” platform developing the pulte homes brand and leveraging the strength of the “divosta” “del webb” and “sun city” names not only distinguishes our communities from the competition but it also earns a price premium in the marketplace reduces overall customer acquisition costs and can result in additional sales in addition our homeowner for life™ strategy and philosophy has increased our business from those who have previously owned a pulte home or been referred by a pulte homeowner by ensuring a positive home buying and home owning experience in 2001 we saw an increase to 36 percent of these repeatreferral buyers that represents almost 2 billion in revenues in 2001 we introduce our homes to prospective buyers through a variety of media advertising illustrated brochures internet listings and link placements and other advertising displays customers are also obtained through referrals from other pulte customers in addition our website wwwpultecom  enables users to search for their home obtain details regarding the local schools services and other features examine mortgage options using an online calculator learn more about us and communicate directly with us over three million potential customers have visited wwwpultecom since january 1 2000 as a result of the merger with del webb we are better able to address the needs of active adults the fastest growing homebuying segment with destination communities offering highly amenitized products such as golf courses recreational centers and educational classes the active adult buyer has many options to maintain an active lifestyle our international sales and marketing efforts focus on the identification of regions throughout mexico puerto rico and argentina which are experiencing population and industrial growth in mexico and puerto rico the demand for affordable and social interest housing is strong in mexico condakpulte has entered into three separate agreements to construct affordable social interest housing with delphi automotive systems gigante s a de cv and centrol comerciales soriana s a de cv in puerto rico the strongest customer demand is for singlefamily detached homes but affordable alternative product offerings include two story attached units townhomes and threestory condominium units with exterior stairs walkups the argentine market offers low levels of competition and a very large residential market in buenos aires 6 homebuilding operations continued construction the construction process for our domestic homes begins with the inhouse design of the homes we sell the building phase is conducted under the supervision of our onsite construction superintendents the construction work is usually performed by subcontractors under contracts which in many instances cover both labor and materials on a fixedprice basis we believe that pulte preferred partnerships p3 an extension of our quality assurance program continues to establish new standards for contractor relations using a selective process we have teamed up with what we believe are premier contractors and suppliers to improve all aspects of the land development and house construction processes we maintain efficient construction operations by using standard materials and components from a variety of sources and when possible by building on contiguous lots to minimize the effects of changes in construction costs the subcontracting and purchasing of building supplies and materials are generally negotiated at or near the time when related sales contracts are signed in addition we utilize the leverage our size affords by actively negotiating our materials needs on a national or regional basis to minimize component production cost we are also working to establish a more integrated system that can effectively link suppliers contractors and the production schedule through various strategic business partnerships and ebusiness initiatives housing in mexico and puerto rico consists primarily of reinforced poured concrete concrete and ceramic block andor brick construction with flat roofs and public water electric and sanitary system connections our argentine housing product is designed and constructed in a similar fashion to our domestic product but is customized for local preferences building materials supplies and components are sourced locally and the construction work is performed by general contractors andor subcontractors under contracts which in many cases include both labor and materials we cannot determine the extent to which necessary building materials will be available at reasonable prices in the future and have on occasion experienced shortages of skilled labor in certain trades and of building materials in some markets competition and other factors our dedication to customer satisfaction is evidenced by our consumer and valuebased brand approach to product development and is something that we believe distinguishes us in the homebuilding industry and contributes to our longterm competitive advantage the housing industry in the united states however is highly competitive in each of our market areas there are numerous homebuilders with which we compete any provider of housing units forsale or to rent including apartment builders may be considered a competitor conversion of apartments to condominiums further provides certain segments of the population an alternative to traditional housing as does manufactured housing we compete primarily on the basis of price reputation design and quality of our homes as well as location the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by a number of economic and other factors including 1 significant national and world events which impact consumer confidence 2 changes in interest rates 3 changes in other costs associated with home ownership such as property taxes and energy costs 4 various demographic factors 5 changes in federal income tax laws and 6 changes in government mortgage financing programs in addition to these factors our business and operations could be affected by unanticipated shifts in demand for new homes our operations are subject to building environmental and other regulations of various federal state local and foreign governing authorities for our homes to qualify for federal housing administration fha or veterans administration va mortgages we must satisfy valuation standards and site material and construction requirements of those agencies our compliance with federal state local and foreign laws relating to protection of the environment has had to date no material effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future on homebuilders and developers thereby increasing the cost of compliance 7 financial services operations our financial services operations are conducted by our mortgage banking and other financial subsidiaries including pulte mortgage corporation and del webb mortgage corporation mortgage banking our mortgage bank arranges financing through the origination of mortgage loans primarily for the benefit of our domestic homebuyers but also services the general public we also engage in the sale of such loans and the related servicing rights we are a lender approved by the fha and va and are a sellerservicer approved by government national mortgage association gnma federal national mortgage association fnma federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and other investors in our conventional mortgage lending activities we follow underwriting guidelines established by fnma and fhlmc our mortgage underwriting processing and closing functions are centralized in denver colorado using a mortgage operations center moc concept we also use a centralized telephone loan officer concept where loan officers are centrally located at a mortgage application center mac in denver our sales representatives who are the mortgage customers’ main contact forward the loan applications to a mac loan counselor who calls the customer to complete the loan application and then forwards it to the moc for processing we believe both the moc and the mac improve the speed and efficiency of our mortgage operations thereby improving profitability and allowing us to focus on creating attractive mortgage financing opportunities for our customers in originating mortgage loans we initially use our own funds and borrowings made available to us through various credit arrangements subsequently we sell such mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to outside investors during the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 we originated mortgage loans for 60 56 and 55 respectively of the homes we sold such originations represented 79 83 and 79 respectively of our originations we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts to reduce the risks inherent in servicing loans this strategy results in owning the servicing rights for only a short period of time usually three to four months after the loan is originated which substantially reduces impairment issues with respect to the fair value of these reported assets the mortgage industry in the united states is highly competitive we compete with other mortgage companies and financial institutions to provide attractive mortgage financing to both our customers and to the general public in originating and servicing mortgage loans we are subject to rules and regulations of the fha va gnma fnma and fhlmc the internet is also an important resource for homebuyers in obtaining financing as a number of companies provide online approval for their customers these internetbased mortgage companies may also be considered competitors discontinued operations during the first quarter of 1994 we adopted a plan of disposal for first heights and announced our strategy to exit the thrift industry and increase our focus on housing and related mortgage banking first heights sold all but one of its 32 bank branches and related deposits to two unrelated purchasers the sale was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 1994 although in 1994 we expected to complete the plan of disposal within a reasonable period of time contractual disputes with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic prevented the prepayment of the federal savings and loan insurance corporation resolution fund frf notes thereby precluding us from completing the disposal in accordance with our original plan to provide liquidity for the sale first heights liquidated its investment portfolios and its singlefamily residential loan portfolio and as provided in the assistance agreement entered into a liquidity assistance note lan with the fdic acting in its capacity as manager of the frf notes the lan was collateralized by the frf notes the lan and frf notes matured in september 1998 however payment of these obligations was withheld by both parties pending resolution of all open matters with the fdic as discussed in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements the company settled its litigation with the fdic in october 2001 and as part of that settlement all obligations under the lan and frf notes were extinguished 8 financial services operations continued discontinued operations continued first heights no longer holds any deposits nor does it maintain an investment portfolio first heights’ daytoday activities are principally devoted to supporting residual regulatory compliance matters and the litigation with the united states government and are not reflective of the active operations of the former thrift such as maintaining traditional transaction accounts eg checking and savings accounts or making loans accordingly such operations are presented as discontinued corporate corporate is a nonoperating segment that is comprised of the company and pdci both of which are holding companies the primary purpose of corporate is to support the operations of our

respect to daily operations homebuilding real estate purchases and other significant homebuilding mortgage banking financing activities and similar operating decisions must be approved by the business unit andor corporate senior management at december 31 2001 we employed approximately 9400 persons our employees are not represented by any union subcontracted work however may be performed by union subcontractors homebuilding and mortgage banking management personnel are paid performance bonuses and incentive compensation performance bonuses are based on individual performance while incentive compensation is based on the performance of the applicable division or subsidiary our corporate management personnel are paid incentive compensation based on overall performance of the company see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements each subsidiary is given autonomy regarding employment of personnel although our senior corporate management act in an advisory capacity in the employment of subsidiary officers we consider our employee and subcontractor relations to be satisfactory

 item 3 legal proceedings we are involved in various litigation incidental to our continuing business operations we believe that none of this litigation will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations our financial position or our cash flows first heightsrelated litigation we were a party to three lawsuits relating to first heights’ 1988 acquisition from the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic and first heights’ ownership of five failed texas thrifts the first lawsuit the “district court case” was filed on july 7 1995 in the united states district court eastern district of michigan by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic against the company pdci and first heights collectively the “pulte parties” the second lawsuit the “court of federal claims case” was filed on december 26 1996 in the united states court of federal claims washington dc by the pulte parties against the united states the third lawsuit was filed by first heights on january 10 2000 in the united states district court eastern district of michigan against the fdic regarding the amounts including interest the fdic was obligated to pay first heights on two promissory notes which had been executed by the fdic’s predecessor the fslic in the district court case the fdic as successor to the fslic sought a declaration of rights and other relief related to the assistance agreement entered into between first heights and the fslic the fdic and the pulte parties disagreed about the proper interpretation of provisions in the assistance agreement which provide for sharing of certain tax benefits achieved in connection with first heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of the five failed texas thrifts the district court case also included certain other claims relating to the foregoing including claims resulting from the company’s and first heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation agreement between the company and first heights the pulte parties disputed the fdic’s claims and filed an answer and a counterclaim seeking among other things a declaration that the fdic had breached the assistance agreement in numerous respects on december 24 1996 the pulte parties voluntarily dismissed without prejudice certain of their claims in the district court case and on december 26 1996 initiated the court of federal claims case on march 5 1999 the united states district court the court entered a “final judgment” against first heights and pdci resolving by summary judgment in favor of the fdic most of the fdic’s claims against the pulte parties the final judgment required pdci and first heights to pay the fdic monetary damages totaling approximately 2213 million including interest but excluding costs such as attorneys fees to be determined in the future by the district court and postjudgment interest however the fdic acknowledged that it had already paid itself or withheld from assistance its obligation to pay to first heights approximately 105 million excluding interest thereon we believed that we were entitled to a credit or actual payment of such amount plus interest the final judgment did not address this issue we disagreed with the district court’s rulings and appealed the decision to the sixth circuit court of appeals on october 12 2000 the sixth circuit court of appeals rendered its opinion in which it affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings the sixth circuit affirmed most of the district court’s adverse liability rulings including as to the sharing of certain tax benefits achieved in connection with first heights’ 1988 acquisition and ownership of the five failed texas thrifts and regarding the company’s and first heights’ amendment of a tax sharing and allocation agreement and rescission of a warrant assumption agreement between pdci and first heights the sixth circuit however vacated the district court’s damage calculations as to a number of issues vacated the district court’s prejudgment interest award and remanded to the district court for a proper recalculation of all such amounts although the sixth circuit opinion left certain significant issues to be resolved through further court proceedings based upon its reading of the sixth circuit opinion we determined that an aftertax charge of 30 million to discontinued operations was appropriate in 2000 in october 2001 the fdic and the pulte parties settled the district court case the related appeal to the sixth circuit court of appeals and the third lawsuit as part of this settlement the “settlement” the pulte parties agreed to pay to the fdic 415 million and the fdic was permitted to retain all amounts previously withheld from first heights including the frf notes see note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements in addition the first heights assistance agreement was terminated except certain tax benefit sharing provisions will continue in effect and the warrants issued by first heights to the fdic were extinguished we do not believe that the claims in the court of federal claims case are in any way prejudiced by the settlement 10 item 3 legal proceedings continued first heightsrelated litigation continued in the court of federal claims case the pulte parties assert breaches of contract on the part of the united states in connection with the enactment of section 13224 of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 “obra” that provision repealed portions of the tax benefits that the pulte parties claim they were entitled to under the contract to acquire the failed texas thrifts the pulte parties also assert another claim concerning the contract that the united states through the fdic as receiver improperly attempted to amend the failed thrifts’ preacquisition tax returns and that this attempt was made in an effort to deprive the pulte parties of tax benefits for which they had contracted on august 17 2001 the united states court of federal claims ruled that the united states government is liable to the company for breach of contract by enacting section 13224 of obra the court will now proceed to determine the amount of damages to which the pulte parties are entitled while it is unclear at this time what amount the court will award the pulte parties are currently seeking approximately 80 million in after tax damages for the united states government’s breach of contract

homebuilding operations  17 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued homebuilding operations continued domestic homebuilding continued net new orders increased for the thirteenth consecutive year to an alltime record of 26116 units in 2001 a 32 increase over 2000 order levels this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of del webb’s operations which contributed 5968 units including an acquired backlog of 3823 units order growth in the central and west groups offset by softer performance in the northeast and midwest groups contributed to a 2 increase in 2000 orders over 1999 levels unit settlements in 2001 also hit a recordsetting high to 22915 units with the majority of the increase due to the inclusion of del webb’s operations which contributed 2797 units unit settlement activity in 2000 increased 1 over 1999 levels reflecting strong performance in the southeast central and west groups offset by a decline in the northeast the average home sales price increased from 187000 in 1999 to 206000 in 2000 and to 225000 in the current year changes in average selling price reflect a number of factors including price increases the mix of product closed during a period and the number of options purchased by customers 2001 benefited from increased product prices improved product mix and the inclusion of del webb product offerings which had an average selling price of 264000 ending backlog which represents orders for homes that have not yet closed jumped 58 to 8678 homes including 3171 del webb units while the

excluding the effect of purchase accounting gross margins in 2001 would have been 202 gross profit margins in 2000 increased to 188 up 100 basis points over 1999 factors that contributed to this favorable trend include strong customer demand positive home pricing the benefits of leveragebuy purchasing activities and effective production and inventory management land sales increased over each

revenues increased 42 basis points to 937 after increasing 35 basis points to 895 in 2000 higher startup costs for new communities increased compensation related costs local market advertising expenses and the inclusion of del webb’s operations are the primary reasons for the increase in 2001 the increase in 2000 reflects higher sales and marketing expenses and startup costs associated with the opening of new communities other expense net increased to 16851000 in 2001 as a result of increased land inventory valuation reserves for certain land positions and amortization of tradenames and trademarks acquired in the merger with del webb the increase from 1999 to 2000 represents an increase in various market level nonoperational expenditures our domestic homebuilding operations

argentina are conducted through pulte srl international’s 100owned argentine subsidiary which recorded its first closings during the second quarter of 2001 the following table presents selected financial data for pulte’s international homebuilding operations for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 000’s omitted  increased revenues in 2001 are due to the opening of operations in argentina and a higher average selling price for our puerto rican operations the higher average selling price in puerto rico which results from concentrating more in middlemarket housing than in social interest housing was offset by a decrease in closings from 264 in 2000 to 176 in 2001 increased revenues in 2000 from 1999 are also attributable to this shift in focus results in 1999 benefited from a 2400000 land sale gain sga expense increased 6199000 in 2001 as a result of the startup of the argentine operations the argentine operations recorded a 463000 foreign currency transaction loss in 2001 as a result of the argentine government’s decision to delink the valuation of the argentine peso from the u s dollar we also recorded a foreign currency translation loss of 14110000 net of income taxes of 8833000 as a component of other comprehensive income in 2001 it is unclear at this time how the argentine financial and currency markets will be affected in 2002 it is also unclear how the current economic situation may affect customer homebuying attitudes and the homebuilding business in general in 2001 the mexican operations were affected by changes in government lending practices which slowed mortgage funding resulting in lower closings than in 2000 it is anticipated that the rate of mortgage funding in mexico will accelerate in 2002 which should increase the pace of closings over what was experienced in 2001 our mexican joint venture operations recorded 7718 closings in 2000 representing a 19 increase over comparable 1999 results our share of pretax income of 5455000 for 2000 for the mexican joint ventures was slightly lower than the 6000000 recorded in 1999 as earnings in 1999 included currency gains of 1702000 versus currency losses of 78000 for 2000 currency losses in mexico amounted to 378000 in 2001 eliminating the impact of the currency gains and losses operating income for our mexican operations increased by approximately 29 in 2000 20 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial services operations we conduct our financial services operations principally through pulte mortgage corporation pmc our mortgage banking subsidiary and during 1999 through pulte financial companies inc pfci pretax income of our financial services operations is as follows 000’s omitted  mortgage banking  we sell our servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held usually three to four months we do not amortize the servicing asset since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts there are no impairment issues related to these assets we also originate mortgage loans using our own funds or borrowings made available through various credit arrangements and then sell such mortgage loans to outside investors mortgage origination principal volume for the year ended december 31 2001 increased 50 over 2000 which benefited from an increase in the capture rate of 400 basis points to 60 an increased average loan size and the inclusion of del webb’s mortgage operations which accounted for approximately 13 of the increase origination unit volume increased 42 due to the same factors mortgage origination principal volume in 2000 increased 3 over 1999 due to increases in yeartodate unit sales and higher average selling prices realized in our domestic homebuilding operations however the number of loans for 2000 was down 2 from 1999 levels due to competitive market conditions and rising mortgage interest rates during the last six months of 1999 and first three quarters of 2000 our home buying customers continue to account for the majority of total loan production representing 79 of total pmc unit production for 2001 compared with 83 in 2000 and 79 in 1999 refinancings represented 10 of total loan production in 2001 compared with 2 in 2000 and 4 during 1999 at december 31 2001 loan application backlog increased 54 to 827 million as compared to 536 million and 499 million at december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively 21 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial services operations continued mortgage banking continued pretax income for the year ended december 31 2001 increased 49 to 283 million due to increases in volume capture rate and secondary marketing gains the addition of del webb’s mortgage operations for the last five months of 2001 contributed approximately 8 of this increase pricing and marketing gains increased 174 million or 71 from the same period in 2000 primarily due to a consistent drop in interest rates throughout 2001 as compared with 2000 net interest income increased 31 million to 50 million during 2001 due to increased production and a steeper yield curve as a result of the drop in interest rates during 2001 offsetting these gains was an increase in sga expenses of 10 million as a result of increased headcount and other related costs due to the increase in volume during 2001 pretax income for the year ended december 31 2000 was unchanged from 1999 as increases in origination fees and other income were offset by decreases in pricing and marketing gains and net interest income during 2000 origination fees increased 16 million or 23 over the prior year due primarily to an increase in brokered loans pricing and marketing gains decreased 36 million or 13 from the same period in 1999 primarily due to competitive market conditions for much of 2000 as compared with 1999 net interest income decreased 17 to 18 million during 2000 as a result of a drop in funded production and a higher cost of funds due to a new warehouse line that became effective march 31 2000 during 2000 we recognized increased equity income from our minority interest in a mexican mortgage banking company and also recognized income from mortgage reinsurance operations financial accounting standards board statement no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by financial accounting standards board statement no 138 “accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities” requires companies to recognize all of their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments a company must designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge we hedge portions of our forecasted cash flow from sales of closed mortgage loans with derivative financial instruments for the year ended december 31 2001 we did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness we also did not recognize any gains or losses during 2001 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur at december 31 2001 we expect to reclassify 592000 net of taxes of net losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next twelve months from sales of closed mortgage loans financing activities our secured financing operations which were conducted by a limitedpurpose subsidiary of pfci ceased operations during 1999 during the first quarter of 1999 we recognized a net gain of approximately 17 million in connection with the sale of its remaining mortgagebacked securities portfolio 22 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued corporate corporate is a nonoperating business segment whose primary purpose is to support the operations of our subsidiaries as the internal source of financing to develop and implement strategic initiatives centered on new business development and operating efficiencies and to provide the administrative support associated with being a publicly traded entity as a result the corporate segment’s operating results will vary from year to year as these strategic initiatives evolve the following table presents this segment’s results of operations 000’s omitted  an increase in net interest expense offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses net resulted in a 2 increase in the net loss for the corporate segment the increase in the corporate net interest spread which is net of interest capitalized into inventory is attributable to a higher debt balance as a result of the del webb merger and the issuance in february 2001 of 200 million and in august 2001 of 500 million in senior notes primarily for use in repaying certain indebtedness acquired from del webb see “del webb merger” the decrease in other corporate expenses net in 2001 is primarily due to the effect of the writedown of a commercial land position in 2000 the increase in 2000 of the pretax loss to 563 million was primarily a result of an increase in net interest expense increases in net interest expense were attributed to higher average use of our unsecured revolving credit facility in addition to the april 2000 issuance of 175 million senior notes interest incurred for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 excluding interest incurred by our financial services operations was approximately 1169 628 and 495 million respectively corporate net interest expense is net of amounts capitalized into homebuilding inventories interest is amortized to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities interest in inventory at december 31 2001 increased primarily as a result of higher levels of indebtedness and the addition of the del webb properties which have a longer life cycle information related to corporate interest capitalized into inventory is as follows 000’s omitted  23 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continuing operations our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2001 was 418796000 as higher net income was offset by increases in inventory and residential mortgage loans availableforsale over 2000 and the resolution of the first heights litigation net cash provided by investing activities in 2001 increased primarily due to the net cash acquired from del webb net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was 297131000 as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of 200 million and 500 million and increased borrowings under the revolving credit arrangements were offset by the repayment of debt acquired from del webb see “del webb merger” net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2000 amounted to 23322000 increases in inventory other assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2000 were less than during 1999 and were offset by a larger increase in residential mortgage loans availableforsale net cash used in investing activities was 5185000 for 2000 the effects of pfci’s sale of the underlying collateral of its mortgagebacked securities portfolio and the purchase of bre’s interest in the net assets of our active adult joint venture are reflected in 1999 net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2000 was 114051000 as compared to a use of cash of 87642000 in 1999 these increased cash flows primarily reflect our issuance of 175 million senior notes in april 2000 and issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock option plans offset by stock repurchases we finance homebuilding land acquisition development and construction activities from internally generated funds and existing credit agreements we had 110 million outstanding under our 560 million unsecured revolving credit facilities at december 31 2001 pmc provides mortgage financing for many of our home sales and uses its own funds and borrowings made available through various committed and uncommitted credit arrangements which at december 31 2001 amounted to 450 million an amount deemed adequate to cover foreseeable needs there were approximately 410 million of borrowings outstanding under the pmc arrangements at december 31 2001 mortgage loans originated by pmc are subsequently sold we anticipate that there will be adequate mortgage financing available for purchasers of our homes in february 2001 we sold 200 million of 8 18 senior notes due 2011 from an active 500 million shelf registration the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay shortterm borrowings under our revolving bank credit arrangements and for general corporate purposes in august 2001 we sold in a private placement 500 million of 7 78 senior notes due in 2011 and subsequently filed an s4 registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in december 2001 net proceeds received from the sale were used to repay certain indebtedness acquired in the del webb transaction to pay certain expenses associated with that transaction and for general corporate purposes our income tax liabilities are affected by a number of factors in 2001 our effective tax rate was 3850 compared to 3850 in 2000 and 3775 in 1999 our lower effective income tax rate in 1999 resulted from a lower effective state tax rate and the favorable resolution of various state income tax matters we anticipate that our effective tax rate for 2002 will be approximately 39 at december 31 2001 we had cash and equivalents of 721 million and total longterm indebtedness of 17 billion our total longterm indebtedness includes 14 billion of unsecured senior notes 3686 million of unsecured senior subordinated notes other limited recourse debt of 15 million and other nonrecourse shortterm notes payable of 607 million 24 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued continuing operations continued the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2001  the following table summarizes our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2001  standby letters of credit and performance bonds are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts principally in connection with the development of our projects the expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the related project if the obligations related to the project are ongoing annual extensions are granted on a yeartoyear basis performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates rather we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed these bonds which approximated 775 million at december 31 2001 are typically outstanding over a period that approximates 35 years in the normal course of business we acquire rights under options or optiontype agreements to purchase land to be used in homebuilding operations at future dates these rights which may be cancelled at our discretion may extend over several years and are typically secured by small deposits further these rights are frequently extended or renegotiated to better match the needs of our homebuilding operations the total purchase price applicable to approved land under option for use by our homebuilding operations at future dates approximated 11 billion at december 31 2001 which represented approximately 35000 lots in addition there were approximately 25000 lots valued at 644 million under option at december 31 2001 pending approval that are under review and evaluation for future use by our homebuilding operations sources of our working capital at december 31 2001 include our cash and equivalents our 560 million committed unsecured revolving credit facilities and pmc’s 450 million revolving credit facilities our debttototal capitalization excluding our nonguarantor asset secured borrowings was 448 as of december 31 2001 we expect to manage our debttototal capitalization to the 40 level by the end of 2002 it is our intent to exercise over time the early call provisions of the senior subordinated notes issued by del webb as allowed under these notes we routinely monitor current operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate the use of available financial sources including securities offerings 25 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued del webb merger on july 31 2001 we merged with del webb corporation as discussed in note 3 to the notes to consolidated financial statements at closing we paid off and cancelled del webb’s revolving credit facility which had a balance outstanding of approximately 300 million at closing under the terms of del webb’s 100 million 9 34 due 2003 senior subordinated notes we exercised our option to redeem the entire bond issuance at par during the third quarter of 2001 under the terms of del webb’s other senior subordinated notes we were required as a result of the change in control to offer to purchase four series of its senior subordinated notes as of december 31 2001 we had repurchased through tender offers and openmarket purchases 127 million of these notes under the terms of del webb’s 150 million 9 34 due 2008 senior subordinated notes we exercised our optional right to redeem the remaining outstanding balance of 122 million at the price stipulated in the indenture by placing with the trustee as of december 31 2001 sufficient proceeds to satisfy a january 15 2002 final payoff inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation because of higher land and construction costs inflation also increases our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when more than one accounting principle or the method of its application is generally accepted we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties as a result actual results could differ from these estimates in preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements giving due regard to materiality inventory valuation our finished inventories are stated at the lower of accumulated cost or net realizable value included in inventories are all direct development costs we capitalize interest cost into homebuilding inventories and charge the interest to homebuilding interest expense over a period that approximates the average life cycle of our communities this period increased in 2001 due to the addition of the del webb properties which have a longer life cycle inventories under development or held for development are stated at accumulated cost unless they are determined to be impaired in which case these inventories are measured at fair value if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory adjustments may be required sold units are expensed on a specific identification basis or on a relative sales value basis as cost of sales under the specific identification basis units are assigned an average cost by project based on actual coststodate plus the estimated cost of completion units costed using the relative sales value basis are assigned cost based on the sales value of the unit in relation to the total estimated sales value of the project 26 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable goodwill and other intangible assets totaled 467 million at the end of 2001 which represented 8 of total assets the majority of these assets resulted from the acquisition of del webb in 2001 del webb has a long history of operating success and profitability has well recognized brand names and holds a significant position in the active adult market which should continue in the future the integration of del webb should enable the combined businesses to accelerate the pace of land absorptions enhance the visibility of the “del webb” and “sun city” brand names and obtain the synergies of enhanced purchasing leverage complementary product offerings and combined operations in the future changes in strategy andor market conditions could impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances
