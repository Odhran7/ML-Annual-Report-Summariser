our distribution centers which we refer to as operating sites distribute branded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing customer service and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating sites offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services we also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various thirdparty services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended july 2 2022 

we estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 





we estimate that sales to our customers in the food service management fsm sector which include large customers that service cafeterias in institutions such as universities hospitals and sporting venues accounted for 6 of sales in fiscal 2022 as compared to 5 of sales in fiscal 2021 these sales are reflected within the respective customer types listed in the table above depending on the type of customer the fsm operator serves 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounted for more than 10 of our purchases for fiscal 2022 these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers we also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to midsized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products our locally sourced products including produce meats cheese and other products help differentiate our customers’ offerings satisfy demands for new products and support local communities purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs domestically and internationally and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating sites 

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our operating sites while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash on hand cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

we extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer’s creditworthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate otherwise we pay our suppliers according to our payment terms 

global support center 

our global support center gsc staff makes available a number of centralized services to our operating sites and our shared services staff performs support activities for employees suppliers and customers members of these group possess experience and expertise in among other areas customer and vendor contract administration accounting and finance treasury legal information technology payroll and employee benefits risk management and insurance sales and marketing merchandising inbound logistics human resources strategy and tax compliance services the gsc also makes available supply chain expertise such as in warehousing distribution and omnichannel strategic services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 6328 million 4707 million and 7204 million respectively were invested in facilities technology equipment delivery fleet and other capital asset enhancements from time to time we dispose of assets in the normal course of business we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets were 6087 million 4115 million and 6917 million respectively capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 were 09 08 and 13 respectively in order to preserve our liquidity in response to the covid19 pandemic we reduced our capital expenditures by eliminating capital projects that were not critical for our business in fiscal 2021 and in fiscal 2022 our capital expenditures returned to more normal levels during the three years ended july 2 2022 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2023 capital expenditures from cash flows from operations and bank and other borrowings 

human capital resources 

we believe engaged and empowered associates drive business success and that attracting developing and retaining the best talent globally to drive our business success is a key driver of the company’s longterm value our diverse associates and inclusive culture create an environment where associates can develop their skills and contribute to our success by driving strong financial performance as of july 2 2022 we employed approximately 71000 employees including 49000 us employees and 22000 employees outside the united states as compared to approximately 58000 employees as of july 3 2021 also approximately 98 of our usbased associates are classified as fulltime associates defined as employees who work 30 or more hours per week and approximately 17 of our employees were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden approximately 90 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to renegotiation in fiscal 2023 

talent acquisition and talent management — maintaining a pipeline of talent is critical to our ongoing success and is essential to our succession planning efforts and to growing leaders throughout the organization our leadership is responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development specifically we promote employee development by cultivating a highimpact learning culture for our associates through a variety of enterprise development programs and learning resources including goalsetting and career development processes we commit to investing in our employees through on the job training and coaching 

a key focus of our talent acquisition has been achieving hiring targets for our transportation associates throughout our industry drivers are in short supply and hiring is a challenge in fiscal 2022 sysco invested in its first sysco driver academy enabling us to develop and train our own drivers which we refer to as delivery partners this program gives our warehouse associate population an opportunity to delivery partners trainees are paid to attend the academy and we pay for their licensing and certification fees 

additionally through a program titled sysco speaks we conduct annual confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party 

total rewards — we are committed to equal pay for equal work regardless of gender race ethnicity or other personal characteristics to deliver on that commitment we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors such as an employee’s role and experience job location and individual performance we also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay in fiscal 2022 our hourly associates received an average hourly wage of 2349 and 100 of associates in our us distribution facilities received pay above state minimum wage thresholds also our fulltime associates receive paid vacation and sick time benefits shortterm and longterm incentives retirement plans training and development access to career opportunities paid pregnancy and adoption leave benefits shortterm and longterm 

disability benefits health and welfare benefits and recognition as well as other programs like dependent scholarships and employee discounts 

diversity equity and inclusion — our diversity equity and inclusion dei team develops global strategic initiatives that are implemented to ensure that the needs specific to each region are addressed to accelerate our global efforts to create a more diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive culture we hired a vice president chief diversity officer in fiscal 2021 we use our global dei advisory council which has been tasked with creating our threeyear dei roadmap and real talk dialogues to provide leaders and associates safe forums to have open honest twoway and completely voluntary conversations our chief executive officer signed the ceo pledge as part of the ceo action for racial equity a group that includes business leaders from across the fortune 100 companies that is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace in addition we are a member of the business coalition for equality act a group of us employers that support legislation providing the same protections for lgbtq associates as other protected groups under federal law

our associate resource groups args are voluntary associateled groups organized to foster a diverse inclusive workplace at sysco and are a critical element of our engagement and dei efforts at both our headquarters and at operating sites by interested associates 

competition 

a large number of companies are engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry our customers may choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores online retailers or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers we compete with local and regional distributors and some organizations that operate on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices there are few barriers to market entry 

we estimate that we serve about 17 of the approximately 300 billion annual foodservice market in the us as estimated by technomic inc for calendar year 2021 technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately 345 billion by the end of calendar 2022 we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2022 while comprehensive industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our operations in the us and canada are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in those trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our sales consultants our diversified product base which includes qualityassured sysco brand products our service reliability the ancillary services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis and our multiregional presence in north america and europe combined with a large geographical footprint of multitemperature warehouses which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time

our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate including the sherman antitrust act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the us these laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices boycotting competitors or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition in many jurisdictions compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions

general 

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco® and brakes® trademarks in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks in fiscal 2022 six of our private brands had sales at or near 1 billion these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry both our us and european trademarks are effective for a tenyear period and we generally renew our trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use we believe the loss of the sysco® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we do not have any material patents or licenses 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore our business is not deemed to be seasonal

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and from other historical trends 

industry and general economic risks 

our industry is characterized by low margins and periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry we experienced an elevated inflation rate of approximately 150 in our us broadline operations during fiscal 2022 primarily in the paper and disposables poultry and meat categories in periods of significant product cost inflation if we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers in a timely manner our results of operations would be adversely affected in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may adversely affect our business due to the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive environment conversely our business may be adversely affected by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin markup or fee per case as a result our results of operations may be adversely affected during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

a shortage of qualified labor and increases in labor costs could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability and the ability of certain third parties on which we rely to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals as a result any shortage of qualified labor could significantly adversely affect our business any such shortage could decrease our ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives in the current operating environment we are experiencing a shortage of qualified labor in certain geographies particularly with regard to recruiting and retaining warehouse workers and drivers resulting in increased costs from certain temporary wage actions such as hiring and referral and retention bonus programs see the discussion under “human capital resources” in item 1 “business” for additional information regarding our talent acquisition and talent management efforts in the context of these labor shortages unsuccessful recruiting and retention efforts as a result of such continuing shortages for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

labor shortages will also likely lead to higher wages for employees and higher costs to purchase the services of third parties increases in labor costs such as increases in minimum wage requirements wage inflation andor increased overtime reduce our profitability and that of our customers increases in such labor costs for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

public health crises pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic have impacted our operations directly and may continue to impact us directly or may continue to disrupt the operations of our business partners suppliers and customers in ways that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition fear of such events may further alter consumer confidence behavior and spending patterns and could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries or globally resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers’ demand for our products 

in response to the outbreak of covid19 and its development into a pandemic governmental authorities in many countries in which we operate and in which our customers are present and suppliers operate have imposed mandatory closures sought voluntary closures and imposed restrictions on or advisories with respect to travel business operations and public gatherings or interactions among other matters these actions have required or strongly urged various venues where foodservice products are served including restaurants schools hotels and cruise liners to reduce or discontinue operations which have adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect demand in the foodservice industry including demand for our products and services mutations of the virus have arisen and are continuing to arise some of which have proven to be particularly aggressive variants as these variants spread some governmental authorities have reintroduced certain restrictions and others may decide to do so in the future which could adversely affect demand in the foodservice industry 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k and subsequent filings with the sec such as those risks relating to our level of indebtedness and may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

unfavorable macroeconomic conditions as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations are susceptible to regional national and international economic trends and uncertainties economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

• unfavorable conditions can depress sales andor gross margins in a given market 

• food cost and fuel cost inflation can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases reducing demand for our products 

• heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending 

• the inability to consistently access credit markets could impair our ability to market and distribute food products support our operations and meet our customers’ needs 

• liquidity and the inability of our customers and suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to collect funds from our customers and obtain the products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request 

• foreign exchange rate fluctuations can adversely impact our competitiveness andor financial results 

the countries in which we operate have experienced from time to time deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in financial markets which have adversely impacted business and consumer confidence and spending and depressed capital investment and economic activity in the affected regions as reported in july 2022 by the us bureau of economic analysis the us economy experienced its second consecutive quarter of negative economic growth which may represent a leading indicator of an upcoming recession a prolonged economic downturn or recession in the us or global economies and the impact on gdp growth corporate earnings consumer confidence employment rates income levels andor personal wealth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs  

we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances such as russia’s invasion of ukraine as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns and the resurgence of demand as travel restrictions associated with the covid19 pandemic are scaled back the cost of fuel affects the prices we pay for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past through among other things our fuel surcharge program we may not be able to do so in the future if fuel costs continue to increase in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements including fuel derivatives to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices nevertheless our fuel hedging transactions may not be effective in protecting us from changes in fuel prices and if fuel prices were to decrease significantly these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higherthanmarket costs for a portion of our diesel fuel in addition our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that any of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations whether due to its insolvency or otherwise which could result in financial losses 

economic and political instability could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to certain risks including economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets in which we operate for example the uk exited the eu on january 31 2020 with a transition period that ended on december 31 2020 local or regional geopolitical events such as brexit and the “yellow vest” protests in france in 2020 have negatively impacted our operations similar future trade or labor disruptions or disputes could have a negative impact on our operations in the eu and other parts of the world 

in addition military conflicts such as the invasion of ukraine by russia can negatively impact global demand in response to such conflicts various governments can and have recently imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties which actions can have a negative impact on our operations although our business has not been materially impacted to date by the ongoing invasion of ukraine by russia it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations or those of our suppliers and customers will be impacted in the short and long term or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business the extent and duration of the military action sanctions and resulting market disruptions are difficult to predict but could be substantial further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the military conflict including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade could result in among other things cyberattacks supply disruptions lower consumer demand and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets any or all of these factors could disrupt our business directly and could disrupt the business of our customers which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this form 10k 

competition and the impact of gpos may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional and multiregional distributors and specialty competitors local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach private label offerings overall purchasing power cost efficiencies and ability to meet customer distribution requirements these suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures online direct food wholesalers and cash and carry operations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

moreover some of our customers purchase their products from us through group purchasing organizations or “gpos” in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders gpos have a relatively larger presence in the healthcare lodging and foodservice management customer segments if these gpos are able to add a significant number of our customers as members it may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting or other concessions such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices which could also adversely impact our results of operations 

business and operational risks 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies increase our product costs and impair our ability to deliver products and services to our customers  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not be able to provide the foodservice products and supplies that we need due to conditions outside of their control we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include shortages of qualified labor for our suppliers work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages transportation interruptions such as shortages of ocean cargo containers unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands civil insurrection or social unrest terrorist attacks or international hostilities such as the invasion of ukraine by russia and natural disasters epidemics pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or other human or animal disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses many of these conditions outside of our control could also impair our ability to provide our products and services to our customers or increase the cost of doing so our current operating environment continues to adjust in response to covid19 placing significant pressure on the foodawayfromhome supply chain customer demand is currently outpacing available supply in certain 

categories certain suppliers are struggling to meet demand for our orders which impairs our ability to deliver products and services to our customers prolonged future supply shortages could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions which may be from climate change could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect demand for our products at any time input costs could increase for a prolonged period for a large portion of the products that we sell additionally we procure products from suppliers outside of the us and we are subject to the risks associated with political or financial instability military conflict trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade including health and safety restrictions related to epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic any or all of which could delay our receipt of products or increase our input costs 

in addition as a foodservice distributor it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase a product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory adversely affecting our results of operations 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business sysco’s brand names trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products whether or not justified could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or reduce public confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers were to become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence in us and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

our relationships with longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships and agreements with a number of our customers some of our customer agreements are terminable upon written notice by either us or the customer which provides some customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors market competition customer requirements customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships we may not be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts that insolvent customers might owe us the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our anticipated change to the mix of locally managed customers versus multiunit customers could reduce our gross and operating margins 

gross margin from our multiunit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to multiunit customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locally managed customers if sales to our locally managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multiunit customers our operating margins will likely decline meanwhile the covid19 pandemic generally has negatively affected multiunit customers less than locally managed customers 

if our sales to multiunit customers were to continue to increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally managed customers we will become more dependent on multiunit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales therefore a future loss of sales to the larger of these multiunit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers they could pressure us to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases our results of operations could be 

materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in consumer eating habits such as a decline in consuming food away from home a decline in portion sizes or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers could reduce demand for our products consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health including shifting preferences for sustainable organic and locally grown products as well as alternative proteins or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods 

changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts millennials the largest demographic group in terms of spend seek new and different as well as more ethnic menu options and menu innovation if consumer eating habits change significantly we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio and we may experience higher costs andor supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to new eating preferences changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home additionally changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products compliance with these laws and regulations as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products may be costly and timeconsuming we may not be able to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits 

in addition in response to the covid19 pandemic and the related economic downturn many consumers preferred to eat at home rather than consume food away from home if these preferences return and consumers choose to avoid gathering in public places in large groups the demand for our products and services could be adversely affected moreover if governmental restrictions were to resume it is unclear how quickly customers will return to their prior eating habits which may be a function of continued concerns over safety or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions including job losses 

expanding into new markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and may not be successful  

an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into new markets and the establishment of new procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in these new markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control public health crises epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in such expansion also include among others the costs and difficulties of identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 

our business strategy also includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example the us and many countries where we do business are actively considering or have recently enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified we are also subject to nonincome 

based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions although we believe that our income and nonincomebased tax estimates are appropriate there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

given the unpredictability of possible further changes to the us or foreign tax laws and regulations and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on our results of operations and cash flow but such laws and regulations and changes thereto could adversely impact our financial results 

if our products are alleged to have caused injury or illness or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims 

we like any other foodservice distributor may be subject to product recalls including voluntary recalls or withdrawals if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness to have been mislabeled misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations we may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards in order to protect our brand and reputation any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures destruction of product inventory damage to our reputation andor lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of products sold by sysco is alleged to have caused injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image umbrella liability insurance that we maintain for product liability claims may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business  

we are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many aspects of our business such as food safety and sanitation ethical business practices transportation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs for a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject please refer to “business – government regulation” in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies conduct audits of various aspects of our operations as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we may not be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times moreover we may not be able to comply with all future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance 

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

• the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water 

• the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes 

• employee exposure to hazards in the workplace and 

• the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials 

in the course of our operations we operate maintain and fuel fleet vehicles store fuel in onsite above and underground storage tanks operate refrigeration systems and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes we could incur substantial costs including fines or penalties and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment in addition we could incur substantial investigation remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties 

for example most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks certain of these laws and regulations in the eu may impose liability for costs of investigation or remediation of contamination which could be material regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of our operations at the site and was not caused by our activities in addition many of our facilities have propane and batterypowered forklifts proposed or recently enacted legal requirements such as those requiring the phaseout of certain ozonedepleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may require us to upgrade or replace equipment or may increase our transportation or other operating costs 

if we are unable to finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively our earnings per share could be materially adversely affected  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected for example we encountered operational challenges in fiscal 2019 related to our efforts to integrate two businesses in france acquired in connection with the brakes group acquisition which integration efforts have adversely affected our ability to drive growth in sales and will continue to be managed into fiscal 2023 integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s 

a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments in addition our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with respect to a significant acquired business could result in material weaknesses andor a failure to file our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission on a timely basis 

we rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis we also use mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and customers further our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the 

company and our business partners this sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property are stored on information technology systems controlled by us as well as systems controlled by third parties such as our service providers 

these technology systems and the operation thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters power outages systems failures security breaches espionage cyberattacks viruses theft and inadvertent release of information we and our thirdparty providers experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees from timetotime including ransomware and phishing attacks as well as distributed denial of service attacks and the theft of data to date these have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however there is no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future especially if the amount of insurance coverage we maintain is not sufficient to cover claims or liabilities relating to an incident 

potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity incident include business disruption disruption to systems theft destruction loss corruption misappropriation or unauthorized release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property including personal information in violation of one or more privacy laws reputational and brand damage and potential liability including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition by governmental authorities of penalties fines fees or liabilities which in turn could cause us to incur significantly increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs and the loss of customers 

as the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in many of our employees contractors and other corporate partners working remotely we must increasingly rely on information technology systems that are outside our direct control these systems are potentially vulnerable to cyberbased attacks and security breaches in addition cyber criminals are increasing their attacks on individual employees with business email compromise scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds or steal credentials that compromise information systems 

the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing to date or which we seek to cause or have caused thirdparty providers to implement may be insufficient to protect our systems information or other intellectual property further we anticipate devoting significant additional resources to upgrade our security measures generally including those we employ to protect personal information against these cybersecurity threats 

further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk failure to adequately assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives would increase our vulnerability to such risks 

sysco’s efforts to prevent security breaches and cybersecurity incidents and to implement effective disaster recovery plans may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations additionally information technology systems continue to evolve and in order to remain competitive we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner our failure to implement timely new technologies may adversely affect our competitiveness and consequently our results of operations 

our failure to comply with data privacy regulations could adversely affect our business 

there are new and emerging data privacy laws as well as frequent updates and changes to existing data privacy laws in most jurisdictions in which sysco operates given the complexity of these laws and the oftenonerous requirements they place on businesses regarding handling personal data it is important for sysco to understand their impact and respond accordingly failure to comply with data privacy laws can result in substantial fines or penalties legal liability and  or reputational damage in the uk and europe the general data protection regulation gdpr which came into effect in 2018 places stringent requirements on companies when handling personal data and there continues to be a growing trend of other countries adopting similar laws including canada since 2020 five us states ie california virginia colorado utah and connecticut have enacted stringent consumer privacy laws in january 2023 we expect significant changes to come into effect in california which will further enhance and extend an individual’s rights over their personal data and the obligations placed on companies that handle this data with the adoption of the california privacy rights act cpra most notably it is expected that employee and business data will be brought into scope which raises the compliance requirements for sysco significantly in terms of internal controls processes and governance requirements continued state by state introduction of privacy laws could lead to significantly greater complexity in our compliance requirements globally which could result in complaints from data subjects andor action from regulators if sysco does not provide sufficient resources to ensure it is able to respond adapt and implement the necessary requirements to respond to the various forthcoming changes which could include federal data privacy requirements in the us while continuing to maintain our compliance with global data privacy laws this could adversely impact our reputation and sysco could face exposure to fines levied by regulators which could have a significant financial impact on our business 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

as described in note 12 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 as of july 2 2022 we had approximately 106 billion of total indebtedness this amount included senior notes and we have the ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility which supports our us commercial paper program 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for us including 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing if needed for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

our indebtedness may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures potential acquisitions joint ventures andor share repurchase programs our level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of future debt financing and financial results and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees in fiscal 2022 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 455 million the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including collective bargaining negotiations actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations changes in the funded status of these plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we for any reason cease to have an ongoing obligation to contribute to a given plan based upon the information available to us from the administrators of these plans none of these plans have assets sufficient to fully pay their liabilities and therefore all such plans have unfunded vested benefits increases in the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future contribution obligations imposed on us and on other participating employers under federal law significant underfunding experienced by a given plan generally results in increased contribution obligations in the form of surcharges and supplemental contribution obligations our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from a given plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan we could also be treated as partially withdrawing from participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain percentage over a certain period of time or if we cease to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all of the collective bargaining agreements that require us to make contributions to a particular plan such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations such as facility closures or consolidations based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 1562 million as of august 13 2022 a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

we had a sizable pension obligation of 35 billion as compared to assets totaling 36 billion as of july 2 2022 both of which have sensitivity to financial market factors that could impact our funding requirements see note 14 “companysponsored employee benefit plans” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the us retirement plan at the end of fiscal 2012 we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan us retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan 

the amount of our annual contribution to the us retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the us retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability in fiscal 2018 we made voluntary contributions of 380 million to the us retirement plan allowing us to set an investment strategy that more closely aligns the duration of the us retirement plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities as a result our us retirement plan holds a greater amount of investments in fixed income securities but also holds equity securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the us retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

as of july 2 2022 we had approximately 71000 employees approximately 17 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden approximately 9 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to renegotiation in fiscal 2023 failure to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages we believe our operating sites have good relationships with their unions but a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

organization and common stock risks 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine except for any action a as to which such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of such court within ten days following such determination b which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court or c for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction 

this provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find this provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in any action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we estimate that we serve about 17 of an approximately 300 billion annual foodservice market in the us based on industry data obtained from technomic inc as of the end of calendar 2021 technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately 345 billion by the end of calendar 2022 from time to time technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and as a result our percentage can change not only from our sales results but also from such revisions we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share 

according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 53 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar year 2021 which is consistent with prepandemic levels as of the end of calendar year 2019 

highlights 

our fiscal 2022 results were strong reflecting growth in volumes and sales effective management of inflation and improved profitability our market share gains in the us segments continued to accelerate through the fiscal year and demonstrated the impact of our recipe for growth strategy on our business advancing our capabilities in supply chain and sales as a result sysco achieved an alltime record for annual sales additionally our teams made significant improvements in operating expense leverage with lower business recovery costs as we continue to emerge from the covid19 pandemic and continued reinvestments in our supply chain and operations productivity performance to drive profitable growth see below for a comparison of our fiscal 2022 results to our fiscal 2021 results both including and excluding certain items as defined below

the discussion of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures including ebitda and adjusted ebitda that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of a restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of 1 restructuring charges 2 expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and 3 facility closure and severance charges acquisitionrelated costs consisting of 1 intangible amortization expense and 2 acquisition costs and due diligence costs related to our acquisitions and b the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the collectability of our prepandemic trade receivable balances our results for fiscal 2022 were also impacted by 1 a writedown of covidrelated personal protection equipment inventory due to the reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 2 debt extinguishment costs and 3 the increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions our results for fiscal 2021 were also impacted by the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the collectability of our prepandemic trade receivable balances as well as nonoperating gains and losses including 1 losses on the extinguishment of debt 2 losses on the sale of businesses and 3 gains on the sale of property 

the fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 items discussed above are collectively referred to as “certain items” the results of our foreign operations can be impacted by changes in exchange rates applicable to converting from local currencies to us dollars we measure our total sysco and our international foodservice operations results on a constant currency basis our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from certain items and certain metrics are stated on a constant currency basis 

management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income interest expense other income expense net net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations 2 facilitates comparisons on a yearoveryear basis and 3 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that as a result are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30th this resulted in a 52week year ended july 2 2022 for fiscal 2022 a 53week year ended july 3 2021 for fiscal 2021 and a 52week year ended june 27 2020 for fiscal 2020 we will have a 52week year ending july 1 2023 for fiscal 2023 because fiscal 2021 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2022 our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2022 are not directly comparable to the prior year in some cases our disclosure will include a fiscal 2022 comparison to fiscal 2021 on a 52week year basis management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2021 consolidated results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis this is calculated by taking onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of certain items more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

key performance indicators 

sysco seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive stakeholder value through sales growth and capital allocation and deployment we believe the following are our most significant performance metrics in our current business environment 

• adjusted operating income growth nongaap 

• adjusted diluted earnings per share growth nongaap 

• adjusted ebitda nongaap 

• case volume growth by customer type for us broadline operations 

• sysco brand penetration for us broadline operations and 

• free cash flow nongaap 

we use these financial metrics and related computations as well as sales and gross profit growth to evaluate our business and to plan for nearand longterm operating and strategic decisions we believe it is useful to provide investors with 

the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business 

key financial definitions 

• sales – sales is equal to gross sales minus 1 sales returns and 2 sales incentives that we offer to certain customers such as upfront monies and discounts our sales are driven by changes in case volumes product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products and mix of products sold 

• gross profit – gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs net of supplier consideration and inbound freight cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes 

adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth 

adjusted operating income represents our consolidated operating income adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance adjusted diluted earnings per share represents our consolidated diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance sysco’s management considers growth in these metrics to be useful measures of operating efficiency and profitability as they facilitate comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business 

adjusted ebitda 

ebitda represents net earnings loss plus 1 interest expense 2 income tax expense and benefit 3 depreciation and 4 amortization the net earnings loss component of our ebitda calculation is impacted by certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance as a result in the nongaap reconciliations below for each period presented adjusted ebitda is computed as ebitda plus the impact of certain items excluding certain items related to interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization sysco’s management considers growth in this metric to be a measure of overall financial performance that provides useful information to management and investors about the profitability of the business as it facilitates comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business additionally it is a commonly used component metric used to inform on capital structure decisions 

case volume growth by customer type for us broadline operations 

case volume represents the volume of product sold to customers during a period of time and improvements in this metric are a primary driver of sysco’s top line performance we define a case specifically for our us broadline operations as the lowest level of packaged products that are sold from our warehouses with one case potentially containing several pieces of a product packaged in bulk case size does not generally vary by location or from period to period due to the design of our warehouses case volume growth is calculated by dividing the change in the volume of cases sold yearoveryear by the volume of cases sold in the prior year sysco management considers case volume growth within its us broadline operations to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating sales performance and as an indicator of gross margin performance management monitors case volume growth by customer type with bifurcation between local customers and national customers as this provides a measure of gross profit performance due to the pricing strategies attached to each customer type local customers are primarily street customers such as independent restaurants that do not have longterm contracts or locally managed customers such as local chain restaurants while national customers are the multiunit customers requiring national coverage from a customercentric view and are managed centrally from the corporate office sysco management seeks to drive higher case volume growth to local customers which allows more favorable pricing terms for our us broadline operations and generates higher gross margins as a result national customers benefit from purchasing power as they are able to negotiate pricing agreements across multiple businesses reducing our gross profit potential but reducing our overall cost per case as national customers have bigger drop sizes while overall case volume growth reflects a key component of sales growth local customer case growth provides additional context around gross profit performance 

sysco brand penetration for us broadline operations 

sysco management considers sysco brand penetration to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the gross profit performance of the company’s us broadline operations sysco offers an assortment of syscobranded products that can be differentiated from privately branded products which enables us to achieve higher gross margin by administering and leveraging a consolidated product procurement program for quality food and non 

food products due to cost efficiencies syscobranded products generate a higher gross margin than sales from other privately branded products we define sysco brand penetration as the percentage of syscobranded case volume sold to us broadline customers over all cases sold to us broadline customers this performance indicator also measured at the customer type level including local and national customers is driven by growth in the distribution of branded products to more customers and more geographies as well as increasing branded offerings through innovation and the launch of new products 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco management considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions however free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see “liquidity and capital resources” for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities and our reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure 

trends 

economic and industry trends 

the foodawayfromhome sector experienced an overall recovery in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 the company experienced disruptions from the omicron variant of covid19 which negatively impacted consumer demand and our customers due to the reintroduction of significant restrictions on their businesses we experienced a strong market rebound beginning in late february which continued into the fourth quarter and we achieved an alltime record for quarterly and annual sales at sysco while the company has experienced macroeconomic pressures from major waves of covid19 doubledigit inflation and the invasion of ukraine by russia impacting the food supply we have delivered profitable growth while we anticipate that recent macroeconomic pressures may continue to create challenges in fiscal 2023 the food away from home industry has demonstrated its resilience and importance over the past few years and we expect topline growth in fiscal 2023 of at least 10 over fiscal year 2022 

sales and gross profit trends 

our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price volume customer mix product mix and the impact of the covid19 pandemic the biggest factor affecting performance in fiscal 2022 was volume growth as we experienced strong results from both independent and chain customers driven by a 103 improvement in local case volume and a 154 improvement in total case volume within our us broadline operations in each instance as compared to fiscal 2021 sysco continues to lead the industry in supporting our customers during this challenging supply chain period including converting our supply chain to a full sixday work week this growth enabled us to gain market share during fiscal 2022 at a rate of over 13 times the industry which exceeded our stated goal for the year and contributed to sysco achieving an alltime record for annual sales that rate of growth is expected to accelerate across the three years of our longrange plan and we intend to deliver 15 times the market growth by the end of our fiscal 2024 

product cost inflation has also been a driver of our sales and gross profit performance we experienced inflation in our us broadline operations at a rate of 153 and 150 in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 respectively primarily driven by inflation in the dairy poultry and fresh produce categories we have been successful in managing our inflation resulting in an increase in gross profit dollars gross margin increased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter and decreased 29 basis points for fiscal 2022 as compared to the corresponding prior year periods largely due to the impact of product cost inflation we are expecting midsingle digit inflation for fiscal 2023 on an enterprise basis across all categories with elevated rates in the first quarter that are expected to moderate over the course of the year we are not planning for a deflationary environment though some categories may be individually deflationary we are continuing to take actions to mitigate the longterm effect of elevated inflation including actively working to improve our cost of goods sold to sysco so that we can pass along value to our customers however the relative price of eating out has been less impacted by inflation than the cost of food at the grocery store and we believe that the food away from home industry will prove resilient 

operating expense trends 

total operating expenses increased 260 during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 driven by the variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes our transformation initiatives under our recipe for growth strategy investments in business recovery costs and expenses due to lower productivity resulting from newer associates our operating results in fiscal 2022 included 183 million of operating expense investments for our recipe for growth strategy with supply chain investments ramping up significantly in the fourth quarter we have made a purposeful response to the covid19 generated labor and safety environment in which we are operating with 193 million in business recovery operating investments such as recruiting costs hiring marketing vaccination promotion contract labor and signon and retention bonuses during fiscal 2022 during the fourth quarter we returned to employment levels higher than fiscal 2019 but continued to experience overtime costs to address growing demand and lower productivity of the new staff productivity and overtime costs were approximately 40 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 which is higher than the approximately 30 million for these same costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect elevated operating expenses during fiscal 2023 as we continue to deal with a hiring environment that is still recovering productivity issues that we expect to improve over the course of this year and continued investments for our transformation all partially offset by our costout efforts we are making these necessary investments to ensure that we can serve our customers which enables us to continue increasing market share profitably at the national and local level even with those significant business recovery and transformation operating expense investments partially offset by the continued benefit of our costsavings efforts we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure 

comparisons to fiscal 2019 

in assessing our financial performance through the business recovery sysco’s management compared our results in fiscal 2022 against our corresponding fiscal 2019 results 

comparisons of results from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2019 are presented below 

• sales 

◦ increased 142 or 85 billion as compared to fiscal 2019 

• operating income 

◦ increased 04 or 89 million as compared to fiscal 2019 

◦ adjusted operating income decreased 37 or 1003 million as compared to fiscal 2019 

• ebitda 

◦ increased 040 or 131 million as compared to fiscal 2019 

◦ adjusted ebitda decreased 07 or 239 million as compared to fiscal 2019 

• diluted earnings per share 

◦ decreased 175 or 056 as compared to fiscal 2019 and 

◦ adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 85 or 030 as compared to fiscal 2019 

key items impacting the comparability of sysco’s results in fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2019 included the impact of operation during covid19 particularly the omicron variant onetime and ongoing expenses associated with the business recovery and the operating expense investments made in support of our recipe for growth strategy 

mergers and acquisitions 

we continue to focus on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our growth strategy we plan to reinforce our existing businesses while cultivating new channels new segments and new capabilities we have completed the following acquisitions in fiscal 2022

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 



the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year 





segment results 

the following represents our results by reportable segments 



in fiscal 2022 us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 707 and 172 respectively of sysco’s overall sales compared to 696 and 163 respectively in fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 us foodservice operations represented approximately 965 and 1079 respectively of the total segment operating income this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when 

compared to other reportable segments see note 21 “business segment information” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses along with sales operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources as operating income includes cost of goods sold as well as the costs to warehouse and deliver goods which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business 

results of us foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2022 the us foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 707 of sysco’s overall sales and 965 of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s reporting segments several factors contributed to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 





sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the prior year in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 





the primary driver of the sales increase in fiscal 2022 was the significant improvement in case volume in our us broadline operations as a result of two factors a the ongoing business recovery from the covid19 pandemic and b the impact of our recipe for growth initiatives case volumes from our us broadline operations increased 154 in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 and 179 on a comparable 52week basis this included a 103 improvement in local customer case growth and a 220 increase in national customer case volume in fiscal 2022 the increases in us broadline case volumes represent organic growth 

operating income 

the increase in operating income for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was driven by gross profit dollar growth and partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 

gross profit dollar growth was driven primarily by the improvement in local cases stemming from a the ongoing business recovery from the covid19 pandemic b the impact of our recipe for growth initiatives c management of higher inflation and d optimization of our business processes and performance the estimated change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation for fiscal 2022 for our us broadline operations was inflation of 150 for fiscal 2022 this change in product costs was primarily driven by inflation in the dairy poultry and fresh produce categories gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of sales was 1895 in fiscal 2022 which was a decrease of 67 basis points compared to gross margin of 1962 in fiscal 2021 primarily attributable to inflationary pressure 

the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by variable costs associated with increased volumes and largely from increased investments associated with the ongoing business recovery including increases in costs for associates such as recruiting costs overtime costs hiring costs marketing vaccination promotion contract labor and signon and retention bonuses we have also experienced an increase in operating expenses due to investments for our recipe for growth strategy in fiscal 2022 additionally we experienced a 1150 million unfavorable comparison of bad debt expense in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 which included a net bad debt benefit due to the significant reduction of reserves on prepandemic receivables that were collected in fiscal 2021 excluding the impact of these prepandemic receivables our yearoveryear change in bad debt expense was not material 

results of international foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2022 the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 172 of sysco’s overall sales 

the following table sets forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 





sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 





sales in fiscal 2022 were higher primarily due to the significant improvement in volume as a result of the business recovery from the covid19 pandemic and the easing of restrictions across our european canadian and latin american businesses during the fiscal year the impact of our recipe for growth initiatives also contributed to volume growth 

operating income 

our international foodservice operations segment returned to profitability in fiscal 2022 the 3347 million increase in operating income for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily a result of an increased sales volumes attributable to the business recovery from the covid19 pandemic along with specific efforts to optimize our gross profit while effectively managing our operating expenses 

the increase in gross profit dollars in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was attributable to the increase in sales volume and effectively managing inflation along with specific efforts to optimize our gross profit dollars 

the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in costs for associates including overtime and hiring associates to manage the ongoing business recovery additionally we had an unfavorable comparison of bad debt expense as fiscal 2021 included a reduction of reserves on prepandemic receivables excluding the impact of these prepandemic receivables our yearoveryear change in bad debt expense was not material 

results of sygma and other segment 

for sygma sales were 115 higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily from an increase in case volume driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurants and inflation and fee increases partially offset by a decrease in volume due to the planned exit of a large regional customer operating income decreased by 563 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 as our increased investments in business recovery staffing drove an increase in operating expenses in excess of our gross profit dollar growth from increased case volume sygma operated at a loss for the first half of fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher than expected labor costs but returned to profitability in the second half of the year 

for the operations that are grouped within our other segment operating income increased 178 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to the recovery of our hospitality business guest worldwide volume for this business has improved as hospitality occupancy rates have grown from prior year levels 

global support center expenses 

our global support center generally includes all expenses of the corporate office and sysco’s shared service operations these expenses increased 453 million in fiscal 2022 or 55 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to investments for our recipe for growth strategy an increase in selfinsurance reserves acquisition and due diligence costs and higher associaterelated expenses 

included in global support center expenses are certain items that totaled 1468 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to 629 million in fiscal 2021 certain items impacting fiscal 2022 were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives and expenses associated with acquisitions certain items impacting fiscal 2021 were primarily expenses associated with our business transformation initiatives 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 2565 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily attributable to lower debt volume partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 1156 million for the redemption of 125 billion in combined aggregate principal amount of senior notes 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 1592 in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 due primarily to the items noted above for operating income and interest expense as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 19 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 adjusted net earnings excluding certain items increased 1260 in fiscal 2022 primarily due to a significant increase in sales volume partially offset by an unfavorable tax expense compared to the prior year 

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2022 were 266 a 1583 increase from the comparable prior year period amount of 103 per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022 were 264 a 1588 increase from the comparable prior year period amount of 102 per share adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding certain items which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below in fiscal 2022 were 325 a 1257 increase from the comparable prior year period amount of 144 per share these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings in fiscal 2022

liquidity and capital resources 

highlights 

below are comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2021 

• cash flows from operations were 18 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to 19 billion in fiscal 2021 

• net capital expenditures totaled 6087 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 4115 million in fiscal 2021 

• free cash flow was 12 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to 15 billion in fiscal 2021 see “cash flows – free cash flow – nongaap reconciliation” below for an explanation of this nongaap financial measure 

• cash used for acquisition of businesses was 13 billion in fiscal 2022 

• there was no significant bank or commercial paper activity in fiscal 2022 compared to 8262 million of bank and commercial paper repayments net in fiscal 2021 

• dividends paid were 9589 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 9176 million in fiscal 2021 and 

• cash paid for treasury stock repurchases was 4998 million in fiscal 2022 compared to none in fiscal 2021 

we repaid senior notes in the amount of 17 billion and issued an aggregate of 13 billion in new senior notes in fiscal 2022 

as of july 2 2022 there were no borrowings outstanding under our longterm revolving credit facility as of august 9 2022 the company has approximately 32 billion in cash and available liquidity 

in fiscal 2020 in order to ensure our liquidity in response to the covid19 pandemic we significantly increased our cash balances using short and longterm borrowings and ended the year with 61 billion in cash with an improved operating environment in fiscal 2021 we paid down 34 billion of debt and ended the year with 30 billion in cash in fiscal 2022 we returned to more normal levels of cash with 8671 million on the balance sheet at the end of the fiscal year as described above our uses of cash during the year included business acquisitions dividends share repurchases and senior note redemptions 

sources and uses of cash 

sysco generates cash in the us and internationally sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded primarily by cash from operations and to a lesser extent external borrowings traditionally our operations have produced significant cash flow and due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access capital markets as needed cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

• working capitalinvestments 

• capital investments in facilities systems fleet other equipment and technology 

• acquisitions consistent with our growth strategy 

• debt repayments 

• cash dividends and 

• share repurchases 

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we continue to be in a strong financial position based on our balance sheet and operating cash flows however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by macroeconomic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as actively working with customers to receive payments on receivables optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue to mitigate any unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations arising from macroeconomic trends and conditions 

we extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer’s creditworthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary in the ordinary course of business customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable the company may utilize purchase arrangements with thirdparty financial institutions to transfer portions of our trade accounts receivable balance on a nonrecourse basis in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow the arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales see note 1 “summary of accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

as of july 2 2022 we had 8671 million in cash and cash equivalents approximately 49 of which was held by our international subsidiaries and generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to withholding and additional foreign tax obligations additionally sysco corporation has provided intercompany loans to certain of its international subsidiaries and when interest and principal payments are made some of this cash will move to the us 

our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive must maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund future reserve payments as of july 2 2022 the captive held 1199 million of fixed income marketable securities and 643 

million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in a restricted investment portfolio in order to meet solvency requirements we purchased 193 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2022 and received 166 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities in that period 

cash requirements 

the company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable and accrued liabilities current maturities of longterm debt other current liabilities and purchase commitments and other obligations we expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets 

our longterm cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include 

• debt obligations and interest payments – see note 12 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further detail of our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments 

• operating and finance leases – see note 13 “leases” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments 

• deferred compensation – the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan and management savings plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement ages and payout periods see note 14 “companysponsored employee benefit plans” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments 

• purchase and other obligations – purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed including minimum quantities resulting from our category management process such amounts are based on estimates purchase obligations also include amounts committed with various thirdparty service providers to provide information technology services for periods up to fiscal 2027 see discussion under note 20 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 

• other liabilities – these include other longterm liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of july 2 2022 including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs unrecognized tax benefits and various longterm liabilities which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments 

• contingent consideration – certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only if certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved see note 4 “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july 2 2022 

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

• our cash flows from operations 

• the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs supported by our revolving credit facility and 

• our ability to access capital from financial markets including issuances of debt securities either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec 

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary 

cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated 18 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2022 compared to cash flows from operations of 19 billion in fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022 these amounts included yearoveryear unfavorable comparisons on working capital due to investment in volume growth that resulted from business recovery and the recipe for growth as well as accrued income taxes partially offset by higher operating results and a favorable comparison on accrued expenses 

changes in working capital had a negative impact of 11 billion on cash flow from operations periodoverperiod with rising sales and profitability accounts receivable and inventory increased in fiscal 2022 partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 

income taxes negatively impacted cash flow from operations as our payments increased commensurate with increased earnings in fiscal 2022 

accrued expenses was a positive comparison primarily from favorable comparisons of accrued interest accrued payroll incentive payment accruals and customer rebate payments resulting from an increase in volume purchase incentives earned by our customers as sales volumes increased through fiscal 2022 

investing activities 

fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 capital expenditures included 

• buildings and building improvements 

• investments in technology 

• warehouse equipment and 

• fleet replacements 

our capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 were 1621 million higher than in fiscal 2021 as we made investments to advance our recipe for growth strategy 

during fiscal 2022 we paid 13 billion net of cash acquired for acquisitions there were no acquisitions made in fiscal 2021 

free cash flow 

our free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased by 3097 million to 12 billion as compared to fiscal 2021 principally as a result of a decrease in cash flows from operations due to investments in working capital and a yearoveryear increase in capital expenditures 

nongaap reconciliation 

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable gaap measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap see “key performance indicators” for further discussion regarding this nongaap financial measure in the table that follows free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 



financing activities 

equity transactions 

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 1282 million and 1304 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire 

we have traditionally engaged in share repurchase programs to allow sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases in may 2021 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 50 billion of the company’s common stock which will remain available until fully utilized we repurchased 6698991 shares for 4998 million during fiscal 2022 as of july 2 2022 we had a remaining authorization of approximately 45 billion we repurchased 3099268 additional shares for 2677 million under our authorization through august 9 2022 

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception dividends paid in fiscal 2022 were 9589 million or 188 per share as compared to 9176 million or 180 per share in fiscal 2021 in april 2022 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 of 049 per share a 002 per share increase from the prior quarter which was paid in july 2022 

in august 2021 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 9 2022 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

debt activity and borrowing availability 

our debt activity including issuances and repayments and our borrowing availability is described in note 12 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 our outstanding borrowings at july 2 2022 and repayment activity since the end of fiscal 2022 are disclosed within those notes updated amounts at august 9 2022 include 

• no outstanding borrowings from the credit facility supporting our us commercial paper program and 

• 2590 million outstanding borrowings under our us commercial paper program 

our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 135 for fiscal 2022 and 097 for fiscal 2021 

in the next 12 months 5178 million of longterm debt will mature we expect to repay these senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 

the availability of financing in the form of debt is influenced by many factors including our profitability free cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and economic and market conditions as of august 9 2022 moo dy’s investors service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of baa1 and a ratings outlook of “stable” standard  poor’s has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of bb b and a ratings outlook of “stable” fit ch ratings inc has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of bbb and a ratings outlook of “negative” a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets as of august 9 2022 the company had approximately 32 billion in cash and available liquidity 

on april 29 2022 sysco entered into a longterm revolving credit facility to replace its previous 20 billion facility the new facility includes aggregate commitments of the lenders thereunder of 30 billion with an option to increase such commitments to 40 billion the new facility includes a covenant among others requiring sysco to maintain a ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense of 30 to 10 over four consecutive fiscal quarters the new revolving credit facility expires on april 29 2027 as of july 2 2022 sysco was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and the company expects to remain in compliance through the next twelve months

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the goodwill and intangible assets allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes companysponsored pension plans and inventory valuation 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values we use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we generally use the income method which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent 

in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill more information on our acquisitions can be found in note 4 “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

annually in our fiscal fourth quarter we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets impairment reviews outside our annual review time frame are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment however if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not  ie  a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is performed 

when using a quantitative test we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit we use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 

certain reporting units have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn in the annual fiscal 2022 assessment all reporting units were concluded to have a fair value that exceeded book value by at least 30 

the company estimated the fair value of these reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models for the purposes of the discounted cash flow models fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate the fair value conclusions as of july 2 2022 for the reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the income approach which include forecasted revenues perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others all of which require significant judgments by management fair value of the reporting unit is therefore determined using significant unobservable inputs or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy the company has used recent historical performance current forecasted financial information and broadbased industry and economic statistics as a basis to estimate the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model these key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and judgment and are subject to change based on future changes industry and global economic and geopolitical conditions uncertainty around the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic and the timing and success of the implementation of current strategic initiatives 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions tax law changes increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate the impact of the recovery from the covid19 pandemic may change our mix of earnings by jurisdiction and has increased the risk that carryforward attributes such as operating losses may occur within certain of our jurisdictions that could lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if these losses are prolonged beyond our current expectations this would negatively impact our income tax expense net earnings and balance sheet 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments 

and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our us retirement plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees our serp is frozen and is not open to any employees none of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates s pecific to our results of operations but such changes could impact our balance sheet due to a change in our funded status due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is n ot a critical assumption 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan is 450 for fiscal 2022 consistent with fiscal 2021 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan is 450 for fiscal 2023 as our longterm rate of return remains the same as fiscal 2022 a 25 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return in the plan for fiscal 2023 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2023 by approximately 90 million 

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 2 2022 was a charge net of tax of 10 billion driven by an increase in the discount rates and a decline in expected return on assets the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 3 2021 was a charge net of tax of 11 billion 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

sysco determines the past due status of trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer and evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable to determine an appropriate allowance for credit losses on trade receivables to calculate an allowance for credit losses the company estimates uncollectible amounts based on historical loss experience including those experienced during times of local and regional disasters the covid19 pandemic current conditions and collection rates and expectations regarding future losses 

in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 the company experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges on its trade receivables that were outstanding at the time the pandemic caused closures among our customers in midmarch 2020 these receivables were all created in fiscal 2020 and are referred to as prepandemic receivables in fiscal 2022 we recorded a net credit to the provision for losses on receivables totaling 155 million which reflects a benefit on the reduction of our allowance for prepandemic receivable balances as we have made excellent progress on obtaining payments from our customers we continue to work with our customers to collect past due balances including through the use of payment plans our balance for the allowance of doubtful accounts as of july 2 2022 was 708 million our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 

inventory valuation 

inventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food and related products and lodging products held for sale and are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout method and net realizable value inventory balances are adjusted for slowmoving excess and obsolete inventories inventory valuation reserves require certain management estimates and judgments which may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation we estimate our reserves based on the consideration of a variety 

of factors including but not limited to current economic conditions and business trends seasonal demand future merchandising strategies and the age of our products 

we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates and the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because of the speed with which our inventory typically turns however these assumptions are inherently uncertain and require estimation and judgment and are subject to change during fiscal year 2022 the change in our inventory valuation reserve was not material to our results of operations or balance sheet 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact forwardlooking statements can also be identified by words such as “future” “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “expects” “intends” “plans” “predicts” “will” “would” “could” “can” “may” “projected” “continues” “continuously” variations of such terms and similar terms and phrases denoting anticipated or expected occurrences or results examples of forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to statements about

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risks consist of interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk fuel price risk and investment risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

at july 2 2022 there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding under our us commercial paper program total debt as of july 2 2022 was 106 billion of which approximately 95 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

at july 3 2021 there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding under our us commercial paper program total debt as of july 3 2021 was 111 billion of which approximately 90 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

details of our outstanding swap agreements as of july 2 2022 are below

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our largest currency exposures are with canadian dollars british pound sterling and euro currencies our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively affected sales by 03 in fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021 the exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively affected sales by 09 in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021 a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2022 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively affected fiscal 2022 sales by 19 and would not have materially affected our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our investments and loans to our foreign operations created additional foreign currency exposure in fiscal 2017 we designated €500 million of euro notes issued in june 2016 as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in eurodenominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations changes in the value of these items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to us dollar exchange rates are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 05 of sales during fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges that primarily track with the change in market prices of fuel we use diesel fuel swap contracts to fix the price of a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of july 2 2022 we had diesel fuel swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 52 million gallons through june 2024 these swaps are expected to lock in the price of approximately 80 of our bulk fuel purchases for fiscal 2023 or 60 of our total projected fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2023 our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 80 million in our fuel costs on our noncontracted volumes 

investment risk 

our us retirement plan holds various investments including public and private equity fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plans at the plans’ fiscal year end december 31 2021 would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2023 however such an unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2023 by 301 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of july 2 2022 by 3633 million

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers we also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to midsized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products our locally sourced products including produce meats cheese and other products help differentiate our customers’ offerings satisfy demands for new products and support local communities purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs domestically and internationally and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating sites

maintain the health and safety of our associates for more information on our covid19 workplace and community response see our covid19 disclosures in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

talent acquisition and talent management — maintaining a pipeline of talent is critical to sysco’s ongoing success and is essential to our succession planning efforts and to growing leaders throughout the organization our leadership and teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development specifically we promote employee development by cultivating a highimpact learning culture for sysco associates through a variety of enterprise development programs and learning resources growing associates through goalsetting and career development processes and reviewing strategic positions regularly and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those roles we commit to investing in our employees through on the job experiences and coaching as well as tuition reimbursement for a majority of our employees in the us to promote continued professional growth additionally we understand the importance of providing competitive compensation and benefits as well as appropriate training that cultivates growth developmental opportunities and multiple career paths within the company 

a key focus of sysco’s talent acquisition in fiscal 2021 has been achieving hiring targets for our transportation associates throughout our industry drivers are in short supply and hiring is a challenge sysco has developed partnerships with driving school organizations on a national and local level to support hiring across our us sites we encourage our business locations to partner with high schools to recruit noncollege bound future graduates to consider a career path that will take them from a warehouse selector to a driver position and beyond our current national partner helps to identify a diverse slate of unemployed or underemployed individuals who aspire to be commercially qualified drivers and present them to sysco as candidates for tuition sponsorship and subsequent hire and our partner provides training to existing sysco associates who choose to pursue a driving career sysco also has an inhouse network of supply chain instructors who ensure that we successfully onboard and train new drivers and support them as they learn how to deliver product to our customers safely and efficiently in fiscal 2022 sysco is investing in its first sysco driver academy that will enable us to train our own drivers for example this program will give our warehouse associate population an opportunity to become drivers trainees will be paid to attend the academy and sysco will pay the licensing and certification fees in return associates will sign a contract to work for sysco for an agreed upon period of time if successful we may expand the program nationally within the us 

furthermore through a program entitled sysco speaks we conduct annual confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party all sysco associates across our global operations are invited to participate and 86 of associates completed the survey in fiscal 2021 aggregate survey results are reviewed by executive officers and the board of directors by acting on results both at an aggregate enterprise level and a departmentbusinesswork group level and by analyzing our scores compared to both global and internal benchmarks we have been able to enhance our culture and improve our overall engagement levels 

total rewards — we are committed to equal pay for equal work regardless of gender race ethnicity or other personal characteristics to deliver on that commitment we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors such as an employee’s role and experience job location and performance we also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay in fiscal 2021 sysco’s hourly associates received an average hourly wage of 2846 and 100 of associates in our us distribution facilities received pay above state minimum wage thresholds along with equitable pay total rewards for sysco’s fulltime associates include paid vacation and sick time benefits shortterm and longterm incentives retirement plans training and development access to career opportunities paid pregnancy and adoption leave benefits health and welfare and recognition as well as other programs like dependent scholarships and employee discounts

our associate resource groups args are voluntary associateled groups organized to foster a diverse inclusive workplace at sysco and are a critical element of our engagement and dei efforts at both our headquarters and at operating sites by interested associates these groups are effective vehicles for diverse associates to strengthen their skills build relationships and foster mutually supportive interactions with their sysco colleagues by the end of fiscal 2021 twelve args had been formed representing gender race ethnicity sexual orientation and gender identification veterans and generations among other groups 

health wellbeing and safety — our occupational health services and total rewardsbenefits teams offer a wide range of programs that address the needs of our workforce we offer our associates and their families programs that support their lives and we offer programs for us associates that support health mind security and community in fiscal 2020 our environmental compliance occupational health and safety teams were combined under one central environmental health and safety ehs team comprising functional experts across many geographies to address ehs at every point in our business process 

competition 

a large number of companies are engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores online retailers or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors some organizations compete with us on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices there are few barriers to market entry existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers 

we estimate that we serve about 17 of the approximately 230 billion annual foodservice market in the us as estimated by technomic inc for calendar year 2020 technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately 285 billion by the end of calendar 2021 we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2021 while comprehensive industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our operations in the us and canada are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in those trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our sales consultants our diversified product base which includes qualityassured sysco brand products our service reliability the ancillary services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis and our multiregional presence in north america and europe combined with a large geographical footprint of multitemperature warehouses which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time

requirements regarding the handling of personal data in addition our business is subject to the uk modern slavery act 2015 which requires certain companies that operate in the uk to prepare a report describing steps that they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their supply chain or business our business is also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 an anticorruption law that criminalizes the failure by a company to prevent persons associated with that company from offering or paying bribes to government officials or nongovernment persons in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company as well as restricting the offer payment or receipt of bribes to or from governmental officials and nongovernmental persons 

all of our company’s facilities and other operations in the us and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those in the us the uk and the eu relating to 1 the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater 2 the discharge of pollutants into the air including vehicle emissions 3 proper handling treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes and 4 protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases further most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks see “item 1a risk factors  business and operational risks  we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance” 

general 

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco® and brakes® trademarks in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks five of our private brands have had annual sales in excess of 1 billion these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry both our us and european trademarks are effective for a tenyear period and we generally renew our trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use we believe the loss of the sysco® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we do not have any material patents or licenses 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore our business is not deemed to be seasonal 

as of july 3 2021 we operated 343 distribution facilities throughout north america and europe 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and from historical trends 

industry and general economic risks 

global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

public health crises pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic have impacted our operations directly and may continue to impact us directly or may continue to disrupt the operations of our business partners suppliers and customers in ways that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition fear of such events may further alter consumer confidence behavior and spending patterns and could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries or globally resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers’ demand for our products 

in response to the outbreak of covid19 and its development into a pandemic governmental authorities in many countries in which we operate and in which our customers are present and suppliers operate have imposed mandatory closures sought voluntary closures and imposed restrictions on or advisories with respect to travel business operations and public gatherings or interactions among other matters these actions have required or strongly urged various venues where foodservice products are served including restaurants schools hotels and cruise liners to reduce or discontinue operations which have adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect demand in the foodservice industry including demand for our products and services in addition some consumers are choosing to stay home due to the perceived risk of infection and health risk associated with covid19 which is adversely affecting demand in the foodservice industry including demand for our products and services recently mutations of the virus have arisen some of which are proving to be particularly aggressive variants as these variants spread some governmental authorities have reintroduced certain restrictions and others may decide to do so in the future which could adversely affect the timing of business reopenings and demand in the foodservice industry 

these events have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business financial condition and results of operations including but not limited to our growth product costs supply chain disruptions and the potential for inventory spoilage labor shortages logistics constraints customer demand for our products and industry demand generally difficulties in collecting our accounts receivables and corresponding increases in our bad debt exposure consumer spending our liquidity the price of our securities and trading markets with respect thereto our ability to access capital markets and the global economy and financial markets generally a prolonged or deeper economic downturn that adversely affects our business financial condition or results of operations could affect our ability to access the credit markets for additional liquidity a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital as a result we may be unable to continue to comply with the debt covenants that are specific to our revolving credit facility which could result in an event of default we may see an increase in bankruptcies of customers which could contribute to an increase in bad debt expense in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 the company experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges on its trade receivables that were outstanding at the time the pandemic caused closures among our customers in midmarch 2020 these receivables were all created in fiscal 2020 and are referred to as prepandemic receivables as of july 3 2021 our prepandemic receivable balance outstanding is no longer significant and a majority of the amount outstanding is reserved within our allowance for doubtful accounts if further significant governmental restrictions are imposed in response to the spread of covid19 including any variants thereof sysco could experience additional increases in past due receivables which would have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing mask use and temperature screenings these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to distribute products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

the ultimate extent of the impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend largely on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we could experience a longerterm impact on our business such as costs associated with enhanced health safety and hygiene requirements in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks or the possibility that venues where foodservice products are served are slow to reopen andor experience reduced customer traffic after reopening 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic may change our mix of earnings by customer type and by jurisdiction and has increased the risk that operating losses may occur within certain of our jurisdictions that could lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if these losses are prolonged beyond our current expectations this would negatively impact our income tax expense net earnings and balance sheet 

sustained adverse impacts to our company certain suppliers and customers may also affect our future valuation of certain assets and therefore may increase the likelihood of an impairment charge writeoff or reserve associated with such assets including goodwill longlived intangible assets property and equipment inventories accounts receivable tax assets and other assets 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k and 

subsequent filings with the sec such as those risks relating to our level of indebtedness and may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

our industry is characterized by low margins and periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry we experienced an elevated inflation rate of 96 combined for the us and canada during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily in the paper and disposables poultry and meat categories the rate accelerated towards the end of the quarter and has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2022 periods of significant product cost inflation may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers in a timely manner in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may adversely affect our business due to the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive environment conversely our business may be adversely affected by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our results of operations may be adversely affected during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability and the ability of third parties on which we rely to supply and to deliver our products to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals as a result any shortage of qualified labor could significantly adversely affect our business employee recruitment development and retention efforts that we or such third parties undertake may not be successful which could result in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods any such shortage could decrease our ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties and a corresponding reduction in our results of operations in the current operating environment we are experiencing a shortage of qualified labor in certain geographies particularly with warehouse workers and drivers resulting in increased costs from certain temporary wage actions such as hiring and referral and retention bonus programs see the discussion under “human capital resources” in item 1 “business” for additional information regarding our talent acquisition and talent management efforts in the context of these labor shortages a continuation of such shortages for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in north america and europe as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the foodservice industry is characterized by relatively low profit margins consequently our results of operations are susceptible to regional national and international economic trends and uncertainties economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

• unfavorable conditions can depress sales andor gross margins in a given market 

• food cost and fuel cost inflation experienced by the consumer can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases which could negatively impact our business by reducing demand for our products 

• heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending which can cause disruptions with our customers and suppliers 

• liquidity issues and an inability to consistently access credit markets would impair our ability to market and distribute food products support our operations and meet our customers’ needs 

• liquidity issues and the inability of our customers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions involving the collection of funds from such customers 

• liquidity issues and the inability of our suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to obtain the foodservice products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request 

historically north america and europe have experienced from time to time including during the covid19 pandemic deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in their financial markets which have adversely 

impacted business and consumer confidence and spending and depressed capital investment and economic activity in the affected regions if similar unfavorable economic conditions were to arise in the future or recent volatility in the financial markets and the global economy were to continue our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to certain risks including economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets in which we operate for example the uk’s exit from the eu which occurred on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and the resulting significant change to the uk’s relationship with the eu and with countries outside the eu and the laws regulations and trade deals impacting business conducted between them could disrupt the overall economic growth or stability of the uk and the eu and otherwise negatively impact our european operations 

the withdrawal agreement between the uk and the eu that established the terms governing the uk’s departure provided that among other things there would be an ongoing transition period under which the uk remained a part of the eu customs and regulatory area until december 31 2020 on january 1 2021 the uk left the eu single market and customs union as well as all eu policies and international agreements as a result the free movement of persons goods services and capital between the uk and the eu ended and the eu and the uk formed two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal spaces on december 24 2020 the european commission reached a trade agreement with the uk on the terms of its future cooperation with the eu the “trade agreement” the trade agreement offers uk and eu companies preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the uk and the eu will now be on more restricted terms than existed previously at this time we cannot predict the impact that the trade agreement and any future agreements contemplated under the terms of the trade agreement will have on our business and our customers and it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results we are currently in the process of evaluating our own risks and uncertainties to ascertain what financial trade regulatory and legal implications the trade agreement could have on our uk and european business operations this uncertainty also includes the impact on our customers’ business operations and capital planning as well as the overall impact on restaurants or other customers in the foodservice distribution industry 

the completion of brexit could also adversely affect the value of our euro and pounddenominated assets and obligations exchange rates related to the british pound sterling have been more volatile since the uk announced it would exit the eu and such volatility may continue in the future future fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the local currencies of our suppliers may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the uk which increases we may not be able to pass on to our customers uncertainty surrounding brexit has contributed to recent fluctuations in the uk economy and could result in future disruptions in economic activity in the uk europe or globally which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects in addition brexit could cause financial and capital markets within and outside the uk or the eu to constrict thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business and could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry any one of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as an example of political instability in fiscal 2020 the “yellow vest” protests in france against a fuel tax increase pension reform and the french government negatively impacted our sales in france similarly future labor disruptions or disputes could disrupt the integration of brakes france into sysco france and our operations in france and the eu generally in addition if changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods services and workers in either the uk or france or in other parts of the eu with respect to brexit or otherwise our european operations could also be negatively impacted 

competition and the impact of gpos may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional and multiregional distributors and specialty competitors local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach private label offerings overall purchasing power cost efficiencies and ability to meet customer distribution requirements these suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures online direct food wholesalers and cash and carry 

operations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

moreover some of our customers purchase their products from us through group purchasing organizations or “gpos” in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders gpos have a relatively larger presence in the healthcare lodging and foodservice management customer segments if these gpos are able to add a significant number of our customers as members it may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting or other concessions such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices which could also adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past through among other things our fuel surcharge program we may not be able to do so in the future if fuel costs increase in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements including fuel derivatives to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices nevertheless our fuel hedging transactions may not be effective in protecting us from changes in fuel prices and if fuel prices were to decrease significantly these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higherthanmarket costs for a portion of our diesel fuel in addition our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that any of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations whether due to its insolvency or otherwise which could result in financial losses 

business and operational risks 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies increase our product costs and impair our ability to deliver products and services to our customers  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not be able to provide the foodservice products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request due to conditions outside of their control we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include shortages of qualified labor for our suppliers work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages transportation interruptions such as shortages of ocean cargo containers unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands civil insurrection or social unrest terrorist attacks or international hostilities and natural disasters epidemics pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or other human or animal disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses many of these conditions outside of our control could also impair our ability to provide our products and services to our customers or increase the cost of doing so our current operating environment is constantly shifting in response to covid19 placing significant pressure on the foodawayfromhome supply chain customer demand is currently outpacing available supply in certain categories certain suppliers are struggling to meet demand for our orders future supply shortages could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions whether due to global climate change or otherwise could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect demand for our products at 

any time input costs could increase for a prolonged period for a large portion of the products that we sell additionally we procure products from suppliers outside of the us and we are subject to the risks associated with political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade including health and safety restrictions related to epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic any or all of which could delay our receipt of products or increase our input costs 

our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products andor to timely provide our products and services and fulfill our other obligations to our customers whether as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as our customers may turn to other distributors 

in addition as a foodservice distributor it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase a product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory adversely affecting our results of operations 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business sysco’s brand names trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products whether or not justified including negative publicity about the quality safety sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to illegal or unethical activities by our employees suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis salmonella listeria or swine flu or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or reduce public confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers were to become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence in us and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time market competition customer requirements customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships we may not be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts that insolvent customers might owe us some of our customer agreements are terminable upon written notice by either us or the customer which provides some customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our anticipated change to the mix of locally managed customers versus multiunit customers could reduce our gross and operating margins 

gross margin from our multiunit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locally managed customers if sales to our locally managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multiunit customers our operating margins will likely decline meanwhile the covid19 pandemic generally has negatively affected multiunit customers less than locally managed customers 

if our sales to multiunit customers were to continue to increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally managed customers we will become more dependent on multiunit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales therefore a future loss of sales to the larger of these multiunit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers they could pressure us to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases our results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in consumer eating habits such as a decline in consuming food away from home a decline in portion sizes or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers could reduce demand for our products consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods there is a growing consumer preference for sustainable organic and locally grown products and a shift towards plantbased proteins andor animal proteins derived from animals that were humanely treated and antibiotic free 

changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts millennials the largest demographic group in terms of spend seek new and different as well as more ethnic menu options and menu innovation if consumer eating habits change significantly we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio and we may experience higher costs andor supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to the new eating preferences changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home additionally changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products compliance with these laws and regulations as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products may be costly and timeconsuming we may not be able to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits 

in addition in response to the covid19 pandemic and the related economic downturn many consumers have preferred to eat at home rather than consume food away from home if these preferences continue and consumers continue to avoid gathering in public places in large groups the demand for our products and services could be adversely affected moreover once all governmental restrictions are lifted it is unclear how quickly customers will return to their prior eating habits which may be a function of continued concerns over safety or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions including job losses 

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful  

an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control public health crises epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example the us and many countries where we do business are actively considering or have recently enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals recently the biden administration committed to increasing the corporate income tax rate and to increasing the tax rate applied to profits earned outside the united states if enacted the impact of these potential new rules could be material to our tax provision and value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified we are also subject to nonincomebased taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions although we believe that our income and nonincomebased tax estimates are appropriate there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

given the unpredictability of possible further changes to the us or foreign tax laws and regulations and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on our results of operations and cash flow but such laws and regulations and changes thereto could adversely impact our financial results 

if the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims 

we like any other foodservice distributor may be subject to product recalls including voluntary recalls or withdrawals if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness to have been mislabeled misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations we may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards whether for taste appearance or otherwise in order to protect our brand and reputation any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures destruction of product inventory damage to our reputation andor lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of products sold by sysco is alleged to have caused injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image umbrella liability insurance that we maintain for product liability claims may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business  

we are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many aspects of our business such as food safety and sanitation ethical business practices transportation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human 

health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs for a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject please refer to “business – government regulation” in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we may not be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times moreover we may not be able to comply with all future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance 

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

• the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water 

• the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes 

• employee exposure to hazards in the workplace and 

• the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials 

in the course of our operations we operate maintain and fuel fleet vehicles store fuel in onsite above and underground storage tanks operate refrigeration systems and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes we could incur substantial costs including fines or penalties and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment in addition we could incur investigation remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties 

for example most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks certain of these laws and regulations in the eu may impose liability for costs of investigation or remediation of contamination which could be material regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal and even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of our operations at the site and was not caused by our activities in addition many of our facilities have propane and batterypowered forklifts proposed or recently enacted legal requirements such as those requiring the phaseout of certain ozonedepleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may require us to upgrade or replace equipment or may increase our transportation or other operating costs 

if we are unable to finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively our earnings per share could be materially adversely affected  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected for example we encountered operational challenges in fiscal 2019 related to our efforts to integrate two businesses in france acquired in connection with the brakes group acquisition which integration efforts have adversely affected our ability to drive growth in sales integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s 

a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments in addition our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with respect to a significant acquired business could result in material weaknesses andor a failure to file our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission on a timely basis 

we rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis we also use mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and customers further our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners this sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property are stored on information technology systems controlled by us as well as systems controlled by third parties such as our service providers 

these technology systems and the operation thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters power outages systems failures security breaches espionage cyberattacks viruses theft and inadvertent release of information we and our thirdparty providers experience cyberincidents of varying degrees from timetotime including ransomware and phishing attacks as well as distributed denial of service attacks and the theft of data to date these have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future especially if the amount of insurance coverage we maintain is not sufficient to cover claims or liabilities relating to an incident 

potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity incident include business disruption disruption to systems theft destruction loss corruption misappropriation or unauthorized release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property including personal information in violation of one or more privacy laws reputational and brand damage and potential liability including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition by governmental authorities of penalties fines fees or liabilities which in turn could cause us to incur significantly increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs and the loss of customers 

as the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in many of our employees contractors and other corporate partners working remotely we must increasingly rely on information technology systems that are outside our direct control these systems are potentially vulnerable to cyberbased attacks and security breaches in addition cyber criminals are increasing their attacks on individual employees utilizing interest in pandemicrelated information to increase business email compromise scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds or steal credentials that compromise information systems 

the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing to date or which we seek to cause or have caused thirdparty providers to implement may be insufficient to protect our systems information or other intellectual property further we anticipate devoting significant additional resources to upgrade our security measures generally including those we employ to protect personal information against these cybersecurity threats 

further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk failure to adequately assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives would increase our vulnerability to such risks 

sysco’s efforts to prevent security breaches and cybersecurity incidents and to implement effective disaster recovery plans may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations additionally information technology systems continue to evolve and in order to remain competitive we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner if our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we do business for example the eu adopted the gdpr a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data we are working to comply with gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area that apply to us such as california’s consumer privacy act that became effective january 1 2020 and we anticipate needing to devote significant additional resources to complying with these laws and regulations our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area could result in substantial fines or penalties and legal liability and could tarnish our reputation 

we need access to borrowed funds to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

as described in note 12 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 as of july 3 2021 we had approximately 111 billion of total indebtedness this amount included senior notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which supports our us commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 20 billion scheduled to expire on june 28 2024 

certain covenants under our credit facilities place restrictions on some of the actions we may take with respect to our common stock our revolving credit agreement as amended in may 2020 and may 2021 includes a covenant that restricts 1 increases to sysco’s regular quarterly dividend and 2 repurchases of equity interests of sysco in each case until the earlier of september 2022 or the date on which sysco has achieved a certain ratio of consolidated earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for us including 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing if needed for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures potential acquisitions joint ventures andor share repurchase programs our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of future debt financing and financial results and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

changes in the method of determining london interbank offered rate libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt 

amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to libor depending on our selection of repayment options in addition certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to threemonth libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 however for us dollar libor the relevant date was deferred to june 30 2023 for certain tenors including overnight and one three six and 12 months at which time the libor administrator will cease publication of us dollar libor despite this deferral the libor administrator has advised that no new contracts using 

us dollar libor should be entered into after december 31 2021 these actions indicate that the continuation of us libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after june 30 2023 moreover it is possible that us libor will be discontinued or modified prior to june 30 2023 the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee consisting of large us financial institutions is considering replacing us dollar libor with the secured overnight financing rate sofr a new index calculated with a broad set of shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate the credit facility and any interest rate swap agreements expiring after 2021 and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us an alternative reference rate could be higher or more volatile than libor prior to its discontinuance which could result in an increase in the cost of our indebtedness impacting our financial condition and results of operations the overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the credit facility or our interest rate swap agreements with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate however we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 12 of our current us employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2021 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 429 million the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations changes in the funded status of these plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we for any reason cease to have an ongoing obligation to contribute to a given plan based upon the information available to us from the administrators of these plans none of these plans have assets sufficient to fully pay their liabilities and therefore all such plans have unfunded vested benefits increases in the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future contribution obligations imposed on us and on other participating employers under federal law significant underfunding experienced by a given plan generally results in increased contribution obligations in the form of surcharges and supplemental contribution obligations our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from a given plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan we could also be treated as partially withdrawing from participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain percentage over a certain period of time or if we cease to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all of the collective bargaining agreements that require us to make contributions to a particular plan such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations such as facility closures or consolidations based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 1702 million as of august 9 2021 a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

at the end of fiscal 2012 we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan us retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 45 billion as compared to assets totaling 47 billion as of july 3 2021 both of which have sensitivity to financial market factors that could impact our funding requirements see note 14 “companysponsored employee benefit plans” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the us retirement plan 

the amount of our annual contribution to the us retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the us retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability in fiscal 2018 we made voluntary contributions of 380 million to the us retirement plan allowing us to set an investment strategy that more closely aligns the duration of the us retirement plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities as a result our us retirement plan holds a greater amount of investments in fixed income securities but also holds equity securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the us retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in 

determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience significant future declines andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

as of july 3 2021 we had approximately 58000 employees approximately 19 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating site approximately 12 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to renegotiation in fiscal 2022 failure of our operating sites to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating sites have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

organization and common stock risks 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find this provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

environmental matters 

item 103 of sec regulation sk requires disclosure of certain environmental matters in which a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and when such proceedings involve the potential for monetary sanctions that sysco’s management reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold pursuant to recent sec amendments to this item sysco has chosen a reporting threshold for such proceedings of 1 million applying this threshold there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period 

from time to time we may be party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business we do not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise we have aggregated certain operating segments into three reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

• us foodservice operations – primarily includes us broadline operations which distribute a full line of food products including customcut meat seafood specialty produce specialty imports and a wide variety of nonfood products 

• international foodservice operations – includes operations in the americas primarily outside of the united states us and europe which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products the americas primarily consists of operations in canada bahamas mexico costa rica and panama as well as our operations that distribute to international customers our european operations primarily consist of operations in the united kingdom uk france ireland and sweden 

• sygma – our us customized distribution operations serving quickservice chain restaurant customer locations and 

• other – primarily our hotel supply operations guest worldwide sysco sold its interests in cake corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

we estimate that we serve about 17 of an approximately 230 billion annual foodservice market in the us based on industry data obtained from technomic inc as of the end of calendar 2020 technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately 285 billion by the end of calendar 2021 from time to time technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and as a result our percentage can change not only from our sales results but also from such revisions we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share 

according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 45 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar year 2020 

covid19 response 

we have closely monitored developments in the covid19 pandemic as the situation has evolved and we are continuously revising our approach to create new processes and guidelines to keep associates and customers safe with careful consideration to remaining aligned with guidance from relevant health authorities 

• supporting employees – we defined and implemented procedures to protect the health and safety of our employees while also ensuring business continuity and our ability to service our customers per our protocols all employees at our offices or warehouses take part in daily temperature checks upon entry our policies for wearing face coverings at all sysco and customer locations are aligned with the guidance provided by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc unless local or state regulations differ 

• serving customers – we have procedures available to limit the contact between our drivers and customers’ employees including alternative delivery methods not collecting signatures for customer invoices and guidelines for safely accepting customer returns these contactless procedures are available to all customers by request 

• assisting our communities – we have donated over 27 million meals in fiscal 2021 across our global operations as part of our community response strategy to the pandemic these donations were valued at over 55 million additionally we continue to support community organizations in their efforts to address hunger and food insecurity by providing direct delivery to food banks and other hunger relief organizations by loaning refrigerated trucks and facility storage space to increase capacity for local food distribution and by providing volunteer and staffing support for mobile distribution efforts 

highlights 

our fiscal 2021 results were strong due to improved sales and disciplined expense management our business recovery is stronger than anticipated in the us and the recovery is beginning to present itself in our international markets our increased profitability drove an improved cash flow performance and allowed us to pay down a large amount of debt we are also making meaningful progress in advancing our recipe for growth strategy which we expect will allow us to better serve our customers and differentiate sysco from our competition see below for a comparison of our fiscal 2021 results to our fiscal 2020 results both including and excluding certain items as defined below 

below is a comparison of results from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2020 

• sales 

◦ decreased 30 or 16 billion to 513 billion 

• operating income 

◦ increased 918 or 6877 million to 14 billion 

◦ adjusted operating income decreased 147 or 2518 million to 15 billion 

• net earnings 

◦ increased 1433 or 3087 million to 5242 million 

◦ adjusted net earnings decreased 283 or 2916 million to 7404 million 

• basic earnings per share 

◦ increased 1452 or 061 to 103 from the comparable prior year amount of 042 per share 

• diluted earnings per share 

◦ increased 1429 or 060 to 102 from the comparable prior year amount of 042 per share 

◦ adjusted diluted earnings per share were 144 in fiscal 2021 a 057 decrease from the comparable prior year amount of 201 per share 

• ebitda 

◦ increased 461 or 6954 million to 22 billion and 

◦ adjusted ebitda decreased 91 or 2162 million to 22 billion 

our discussion of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures including ebitda and adjusted ebitda that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures to remove the impact of restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of 1 restructuring charges 2 expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives and 3 facility closure and severance charges and by acquisitionrelated costs consisting of 1 intangible amortization expense related to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of cucina lux investments limited the brakes acquisition and 2 due diligence and integration costs incurred in fiscal 2021 associated with the acquisition of greco and sons which closed in august 2021 our results for fiscal 2021 were also impacted by the reduction of bad debt expense previously recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the collectability of our prepandemic trade receivable balances as well as nonoperating gains and losses including 1 losses on the extinguishment of debt 2 losses on the sale of businesses and 3 gains on the sale of property 

fiscal 2020 results of operations were also negatively impacted by costs arising from the covid19 pandemic and are also adjusted to remove the impact of 1 excess bad debt expense as we experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges 2 goodwill and intangibles impairment charges and 3 fixed asset impairment charges while sysco traditionally incurs bad debt expense the magnitude of such expenses and benefits that we have experienced since the onset of the covid19 pandemic is not indicative of our normal operations our adjusted results have not been normalized in a manner that would exclude the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business as such sysco has not adjusted its results for lost sales inventory writeoffs or other costs associated with the covid19 pandemic not previously stated 

the fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 items discussed above are collectively referred to as “certain items” the results of our foreign operations can be impacted by changes in exchange rates applicable to converting from local currencies to us dollars we measure our total sysco and our international foodservice operations results on a constant currency basis our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from certain items and certain metrics are stated on a constant currency basis 

management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income interest expense other income expense net net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations 2 facilitates comparisons on a yearoveryear basis and 3 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that as a result are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30th this resulted in a 53week year ended july 3 2021 for fiscal 2021 a 52week year ended june 27 2020 for fiscal 2020 and a 52week year ended june 29 2019 for fiscal 2019 we will have a 52week year ending july 2 2022 for fiscal 2022 because fiscal 2021 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2020 our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2021 are not directly comparable to the prior year management 

believes that adjusting the fiscal 2021 consolidated results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis this is calculated by taking onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of certain items more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

key performance indicators 

sysco seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive stakeholder value through sales growth and capital allocation and deployment the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted the financial metrics used by management to evaluate the business and certain metrics continue to be a near and longterm focus while other metrics do not provide meaningful comparable information in the nearterm we believe the following are our most significant performance metrics in our current business environment 

• adjusted operating income growth nongaap 

• adjusted diluted earnings per share growth nongaap 

• adjusted ebitda nongaap 

• case volume growth by customer type for us broadline operations 

• sysco brand penetration for us broadline operations and 

• free cash flow nongaap 

we use these financial metrics and related computations as well as sales and gross profit growth to evaluate our business and to plan for nearand longterm operating and strategic decisions we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business 

key financial definitions 

• sales – sales is equal to gross sales minus 1 sales returns and 2 sales incentives that we offer to certain customers such as upfront monies and discounts our sales are driven by changes in case volumes product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products and mix of products sold 

• gross profit – gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs net of supplier consideration and inbound freight cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes 

adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth 

adjusted operating income represents our consolidated operating income adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance adjusted diluted earnings per share represents our consolidated diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance sysco’s management considers growth in these metrics to be useful measures of operating efficiency and profitability as they facilitate comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business 

adjusted ebitda 

ebitda represents net earnings loss plus 1 interest expense 2 income tax expense and benefit 3 depreciation and 4 amortization the net earnings loss component of our ebitda calculation is impacted by certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance as a result in the nongaap reconciliations below for each period presented adjusted ebitda is computed as ebitda plus the impact of certain items excluding certain items related to interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization sysco’s management considers growth in this metric to be a measure of overall financial performance that provides useful information to management and investors about the profitability of the business as it facilitates comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a 

measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business additionally it is a commonly used component metric used to inform on capital structure decisions 

case volume growth by customer type for us broadline operations 

case volume represents the volume of product sold to customers during a period of time and improvements in this metric are a primary driver of sysco’s top line performance we define a case specifically for our us broadline operations as the lowest level of packaged products that are sold from our warehouses with one case potentially containing several pieces of a product packaged in bulk case size does not generally vary by location or from period to period due to the design of our warehouses case volume growth is calculated by dividing the change in the volume of cases sold yearoveryear by the volume of cases sold in the prior year sysco management considers case volume growth within its us broadline operations to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating sales performance and as an indicator of gross margin performance management monitors case volume growth by customer type with bifurcation between local customers and national customers as this provides a measure of gross profit performance due to the pricing strategies attached to each customer type local customers are primarily street customers such as independent restaurants that do not have longterm contracts or locally managed customers such as local chain restaurants while national customers are the multiunit customers requiring national coverage from a customercentric view and are managed centrally from the corporate office sysco management seeks to drive higher case volume growth to local customers which allows more favorable pricing terms for our us broadline operations and generates higher gross margins as a result national customers benefit from purchasing power as they are able to negotiate pricing agreements across multiple businesses reducing our gross profit potential but reducing our overall cost per case as national customers have bigger drop sizes while overall case volume growth reflects a key component of sales growth local customer case growth provides additional context around gross profit performance 

sysco brand penetration for us broadline operations 

sysco management considers sysco brand penetration to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the gross profit performance of the company’s us broadline operations sysco offers an assortment of syscobranded products that can be differentiated from privately branded products which enables us to achieve higher gross margin by administering and leveraging a consolidated product procurement program for quality food and nonfood products due to cost efficiencies syscobranded products generate a higher gross margin than sales from other privately branded products we define sysco brand penetration as the percentage of syscobranded case volume sold to us broadline customers over all cases sold to us broadline customers this performance indicator also measured at the customer type level including local and national customers is driven by growth in the distribution of branded products to more customers and more geographies as well as increasing branded offerings through innovation and the launch of new products 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco management considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions however free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see “liquidity and capital resources” for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities and our reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure 

trends 

economic and industry trends 

in response to the covid19 pandemic national and local governments have imposed substantial restrictions upon the customers we serve in the foodawayfromhome sector however we saw demand in the restaurant industry increase throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as restrictions continued to ease the us foodservice industry is now within 5 of calendar year 2019 levels as foot traffic has increased since march 2021 and continues to increase more than foot traffic in grocery stores consumer spending power is robust signaling that the foodawayfromhome sector is not permanently impaired but rather is vibrant and healthy our performance in the nonrestaurant sectors of our business trailed the success of restaurants in fiscal 2021 however we are beginning to see improvements in the travel hospitality and food service management sectors of our business as restrictions ease and as leisure travel has returned this summer we expect these nonrestaurant business sectors to improve further as travel restrictions continue to ease and businesses return to the office setting our international foodservice operations segment improved sequentially throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as most international regions have begun meaningfully easing the restrictions affecting our customers sysco is best positioned to support the rapidly increasing demand due to our balance sheet our large physical footprint and our substantial human capital investment in salespeople and supply chain resources the spread of the covid19 variants is creating uncertainty in our industry’s business environment however the future impact to our customers and to sysco’s results is not yet known 

the return of robust customer demand has created pressure on us and our industry for available product supply in select categories our supplier partners are struggling with meeting the demand of sysco’s orders and certain product categories remain in short supply we believe that sysco is performing better than the industry at large in delivering what we refer to as customer fill rate but we are performing below our historical performance standards our merchant teams are working closely with current suppliers and actively sourcing incremental supply from new suppliers and we are working with our sales teams to offer product substitutions to our customers in the current operating environment we are experiencing a tight labor market particularly with our warehouse and driver positions which is more concentrated in certain geographic areas this is resulting in cost pressures as we adopt mostly temporary wage actions such as hiring bonuses referral bonuses and even retention bonus programs we are working aggressively to fill open positions and improve productivity to offset cost increases 

sales and gross profit trends 

our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price volume customer mix product mix and the impact of the covid19 pandemic the biggest factor affecting performance in fiscal 2021 was the covid19 pandemic due to reduced volume the restaurant sector of our business however had nearly achieved full recovery as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as local sales volumes have exceeded fiscal 2019 volume levels we are experiencing especially strong results from independent customers sysco has increased market share in this rapidly expanding market sales growth has continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with july results indicating a further acceleration of this increase we expect our fiscal 2022 sales will exceed fiscal 2019 sales by midsingle digits with all segments of our business expected to exceed fiscal 2019 sales except for our lodging supply business and food service management component of our us foodservice operations during fiscal 2022 we expect to achieve growth at a rate of 12 times the industry that rate of growth is expected to accelerate across the three years of our long range plan and we intend to deliver 15 times the market growth in fiscal 2024 

in terms of customer mix during fiscal 2021 we grew our local customer count by approximately 10 as compared to fiscal 2019 which is a pace 25 times greater than the broadline industry we believe these efforts demonstrate our ability to accelerate future growth we continue to win business at the national and contract sales level we have added commitments to over 20 billion of net new national account business on an annualized basis since the beginning of the pandemic with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 representing another strong quarter of new contracts signed the momentum shown in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 has accelerated into the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and over the course of fiscal 2022 we expect to see an improving market as additional sectors including international markets specialty foods schools and colleges and business office cafeterias begin to reopen 

our gross margin decreased 48 points in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year period as we managed profitability in an inflationary environment the primary reason for the gross margin dilution at the enterprise level was business mix however our higher margin us foodservice operations segment business is currently growing alongside improvements in highermargin business in our international foodservice operations segment reducing the business mix impact on gross margin from the lowermargin sygma segment manufacturers passed inflation to us and we have passed it on to customers across categories and customer types in terms of the impact on pricing we experienced inflation at a rate of 96 combined for the us and canada during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily in the paper and disposables poultry and meat categories the rate accelerated towards the end of the quarter and continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the majority of our customer contracts have provisions to pass through inflation and we are working closely and carefully with customers not managed through a contract we are educating restaurant operators that consumers currently appear willing to accept menu price increases the increased inflation is expected to benefit sales while slightly negatively impacting gross margin rates and positively impacting gross profit dollars for fiscal 2022 we expect gross margins to improve over fiscal 2021 and approach our fiscal 2019 levels 

operating expense trends 

total operating expenses decreased 135 during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the largest contributors to the decrease were the reduction of variable costs early in the year as sales declined due to covid19 achievement of costout initiatives across fiscal 2021 see “costout measures” below and the benefit from a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts resulting from improved collections many of sysco’s customers were operating at a substantially reduced volume due to governmental requirements for closures or other socialdistancing measures and a portion of sysco’s customers closed some of these customers ceased paying their outstanding receivables creating uncertainty as to their collectability we established reserves for bad debts in fiscal 2020 for these receivables however collections have improved in fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2021 we recorded a net credit to the provision for losses on receivables totaling 1527 million which reflects a benefit on the reduction of our allowance for prepandemic receivable balances as we have made excellent progress on obtaining timely payments from our customers we continue to work with our customers to collect past due balances including through the use of payment plans we have also discontinued charging interest on past due balances as of july 3 2021 our prepandemic receivable balance outstanding is no longer significant and a majority of the amount outstanding is reserved within our allowance for doubtful accounts the covid19 pandemic is more widespread and longer in duration than historical disasters that have impacted our business and it is possible that actual uncollectible amounts will differ and additional charges may be required however if collections continue to improve it is also possible that additional reductions in our bad debt reserve could occur 

costout measures 

the covid19 crisis has compelled us to take action to reduce costs by reducing variable expenses in response to reduced customer demand aligning inventory to current sales trends reducing capital expenditures to only critical projects and targeted investments and tightly managing receivables these actions produced savings in fiscal 2021 and we have surpassed our fiscal 2021 goal of 350 million of cost savings the majority of these savings came from selling general and administrative costs but some savings came from cost of goods sold as we continue to improve our capabilities to better optimize supplier relationships from our selling general and administrative costs we have reduced payrelated expenses through headcount reductions across the organization most of which occurred in fiscal 2020 with the improvement in sales volume due to the business recovery however we have hired over 6000 additional associates in the second half of fiscal 2021 we continue to have hiring needs as the business recovery is happening faster than anticipated other examples of the cost saving efforts are the regionalization of our broadline and specialty produce operations and the achievements we have made in reducing healthcare contract costs indirect sourcing and freight contract costs we expect to drive continued cost savings opportunities to help fuel our future growth agenda and we are now targeting over 750 million in savings through fiscal 2024 including the savings delivered in fiscal 2021 these savings are structural and permanent and are expected to substantially benefit the company so that we can grow our profit and create growth for the future we expect to invest most of the fiscal 2022 savings into both the recovery occurring within our industry including the temporary wage actions noted in “economic and industry trends” above as well as our recipe for growth transformational initiatives 

income tax trends 

our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions tax law changes increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate the impact of the covid19 pandemic may change our mix of earnings by jurisdiction and has increased the risk that operating losses may occur within certain of our jurisdictions that could 

lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if these losses are prolonged beyond our current expectations these effects would negatively impact our income tax expense net earnings and balance sheet 

our effective tax rate has been influenced by discrete events such as tax law changes and excess tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises as discussed in note 19 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in fiscal 2022 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24 

mergers and acquisitions 

we continue to focus on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our growth strategy in august 2021 we acquired within our us foodservice operations greco and sons a leading independent italian specialty distributor in the us with approximately 800 million in annual revenue 

divestitures 

sysco sold its interests in davigel spain part of the international foodservice operations segment in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and sold its interest in cake corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 these operations were not significant to sysco’s business and these divestitures will facilitate our efforts to prioritize our focus and investments on our core business 

strategy 

our purpose is “connecting the world to share food and care for one another” which we believe will allow us to grow substantially faster than the foodservice distribution industry and deliver profitable growth through our “recipe for growth” transformation this growth transformation is supported by strategic pillars that we believe will allow us to better serve our customers including 

• digital – we will enrich the customer experience through personalized digital tools that reduce friction in the purchase experience and introduce innovation to our customers we continue to see excellent utilization of our sysco shop platform by customers and the implementation of our pricing software is on track to be complete by the end of this calendar year we also have a new personalization engine that is currently under construction and has proved to be beneficial to our pilot customers 

• products and solutions – we will provide customerfocused marketing and merchandising solutions that inspire increased sales of our broad assortment of fair priced products and services we are improving our merchandising and marketing solutions by developing improved strategies for specific cuisine segments 

• supply chain – we will efficiently and consistently serve customers with the products they need when and how they need them through a flexible agile delivery framework we are developing a more nimble accessible and productive supply chain that is better positioned to support customers in their business recovery we and have eliminated order minimums for our customers our strategic initiatives to increase delivery frequency and enable omnichannel inventory fulfillment remain on track 

• customer teams – our greatest strength is our people people who are passionate about food and food service our diverse team delivers expertise and differentiated services designed to help our customers grow their business we intend to improve the effectiveness of our sales organization by leveraging data to increase the yield of the sales process 

• future horizons – we are committed to responsible growth we will cultivate new channels new segments and new capabilities while being stewards of our company and our planet we will fund our journey through costout and efficiency improvements 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 



the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year 



1 other income expense net was income of 276 million in fiscal 2021 and expense of 479 million in fiscal 2020 

segment results 

the following represents our results by reportable segments 



based on information in note 21 “business segment information” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in fiscal 2021 us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 696 and 163 respectively of sysco’s overall sales compared to 695 and 183 respectively in fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 us foodservice operations represented approximately 1079 and 1216 respectively of the total segment operating income this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses along with sales operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources as operating income includes cost of goods sold as well as the costs to warehouse and deliver goods which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business 

results of us foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2021 the us foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 696 of sysco’s overall sales and 1079 of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s reporting segments several factors contributed to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year

sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the prior year in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



1 includes product cost inflation of 43 for us broadline operations 

2 case volume excludes the volume impact from our customcut meat and seafood subsidiaries that do not measure volume in cases any impact in volumes from these operations are included within “other” 

sales were 29 lower in fiscal 2021 than in fiscal 2020 the primary driver of the decrease was the significant decline in case volume in our us broadline operations as a result of some of our customers closing and many other customers operating at a substantially reduced volume through portions of the fiscal year in response to the covid19 pandemic we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 8228 million of sales during the fiscal year our sales have progressively improved throughout fiscal 2021 due to volume improvements commensurate with an easing of restrictions on our customers case volumes for the company’s us broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months decreased 58 in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and included a 11 decline in locally managed customer case growth along with a decrease of 115 in national customer case volume including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted locally managed customer sales by 01 therefore organic local case volume which excludes acquisitions decreased 12 

operating income 

operating income increased by 226 in fiscal 2021 over fiscal 2020 as our decline in gross profits was outpaced by the reduction of operating expenses operating income on an adjusted basis which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below for fiscal 2021 increased 33 or 736 million compared to fiscal 2020 we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 584 million of adjusted operating income during the fiscal year 

gross profit dollars decreased 34 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 driven primarily by the decline in local cases and a decline in syscobranded products the decrease was partially offset by higher inflation we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 1582 million of gross profit during the fiscal year our sysco brand sales as a percentage of total us cases decreased 87 basis points in fiscal 2021 which was driven by customer and product mix shift sysco brand sales as a percentage of local us cases decreased by approximately 212 basis points in fiscal 2021 which was driven by product mix shifting into prepackaged and takeaway ready products the estimated change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation in fiscal 2021 for our us broadline operations was inflation of 43 and was primarily driven by inflation in the paper and disposables poultry and meat categories gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of sales was 1962 in fiscal 2021 which was a decrease of 11 basis points compared to gross margin of 1973 in fiscal 2020 respectively primarily attributable to customer and product mix shift 

operating expenses in fiscal 2021 decreased 133 or 6994 million compared to fiscal 2020 our decline in operating expenses during fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by a favorable comparison of bad debt expense including the reduction of reserves on prepandemic receivables and a decrease in payrelated costs associated with permanent headcount reductions made in fiscal 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic operating expenses on an adjusted basis which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below for fiscal 2021 decreased 64 or 3197 million compared to fiscal 2020 we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 998 million of adjusted operating expense during the fiscal year 

results of international foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2021 the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 163 of sysco’s overall sales 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 



1 see “nongaap reconciliations” below 

sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



1 the impact of volumes as a component of sales growth from international operations are included within “other” volume in our foreign operations includes volume metrics that differ from country to country and cannot be aggregated on a consistent comparable basis 

sales in fiscal 2021 were 137 lower as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the significant decline in volume as our european canadian and latin american businesses have been substantially impacted by lockdowns although the restrictions in place are currently easing in many regions we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 1783 million of sales during the fiscal year in fiscal 2021 changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected sales by 46 resulting in an 183 decrease in sales on a constant currency basis 

operating income 

operating income decreased by 1390 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the decline in business resulting from the reductions in our customers’ business in response to the covid19 pandemic operating income 

on an adjusted basis which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below decreased by 2368 million or 2192 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 we estimate that the extra week had a negligible impact on adjusted operating income during the fiscal year foreign exchange rates positively affected operating income by 88 in fiscal 2021 therefore adjusted operating income decreased 2104 on a constant currency basis as compared to fiscal 2020 

gross profit dollars decreased by 158 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily attributable to decreased sales we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 354 million of gross profit during the fiscal year changes in foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2021 positively affected gross profit by 47 resulting in a 205 decrease in adjusted gross profit on a constant currency basis as compared to fiscal 2020 gross margin decreased by 51 basis points as a result of country mix customer mix and product mix 

operating expenses in fiscal 2021 decreased 193 or 4487 million as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in payrelated costs associated with permanent workforce reductions made in fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic additionally the reduction of reserves on prepandemic receivables and reduced restructuring and integration charges in europe contributed to the decrease operating expenses on an adjusted basis which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below in fiscal 2021 decreased 39 or 729 million compared to fiscal 2020 we estimate that the extra week accounted for 354 million of adjusted operating expense during the fiscal year changes in foreign exchange rates used to translate our foreign operating expenses into us dollars in fiscal 2021 negatively affected operating expenses during the period by 55 resulting in a 94 decrease in adjusted operating expenses on a constant currency basis as compared to fiscal 2020 

results of sygma and other segment 

for sygma sales were 170 higher in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily from an increase in case volume driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurants servicing drivethrough traffic through the covid19 pandemic we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 1338 million of sales during the fiscal year operating income increased by 428 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 as our increase in gross profit from increased case volume exceeded the increase in operating expenses adjusted operating income which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below increased by 234 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 12 million of adjusted operating income during the fiscal year 

for the operations that are grouped within other operating loss decreased 210 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to reduced operating expenses as we sold a noncore asset cake corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 our hospitality business guest worldwide had a gross profit decrease of 245 in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 this business remains challenged as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels despite operating in a difficult hospitality environment the business improved its underlying profitability during the second half of fiscal 2021 as leisure travel increased and as the travel and hospitality sector continued its recovery 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses in fiscal 2021 decreased 598 million or 67 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with the business impacts of the covid19 pandemic including severance charges related to permanent headcount reductions made in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 and goodwill impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2020 lower charges for professional fees and other business transformation initiatives also contributed to the decrease corporate expenses on an adjusted basis increased 977 million or 146 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in incentives and stockbased compensation expense as compared to fiscal 2020 when these expenses were lower due to reduced performance against targets expenses for our transformational investments also contributed to the increase we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2021 accounted for 160 million of adjusted corporate expenses during the fiscal year 

included in corporate expenses are certain items that totaled 629 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to 2203 million in fiscal 2020 certain items impacting fiscal 2021 were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation initiatives certain items impacting fiscal 2020 were primarily expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives severance charges arising from the covid19 pandemic and goodwill impairment charges 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 4719 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily attributable the purchase of senior notes and debentures due 2027 2028 2030 2039 2040 and 2050 pursuant to a tender offer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 interest charges included a loss of 2939 million related to the purchase costs noted above and are considered certain items excluding certain items our adjusted interest expense which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below increased 1780 million due to higher fixed debt volume partially offset by lower floating interest rates 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 1433 in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year due primarily to the items noted above for operating income and interest expense as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 11 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 adjusted net earnings excluding certain items decreased 2916 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to a significant decrease in sales volume and a large increase in interest expense 

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2021 were 103 a 1452 increase from the comparable prior year period amount of 042 per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2021 were 102 a 1429 increase from the comparable prior year period amount of 042 per share adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding certain items which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided in “nongaap reconciliations” below in fiscal 2021 were 144 a 284 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 201 per share these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings in fiscal 2021

liquidity and capital resources 

highlights 

below are comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2020 

• cash flows from operations were 19 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 16 billion in fiscal 2020 

• net capital expenditures totaled 4115 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 6917 million in fiscal 2020 

• free cash flow was 15 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 9270 million in fiscal 2020 see “cash flows – free cash flow – nongaap reconciliation” below for an explanation of this nongaap financial measure 

• there were no acquisitions in fiscal 2021 cash used for acquisition of businesses was 1428 million in fiscal 2020 

• there were 8262 million of bank and commercial paper repayments net in fiscal 2021 compared to 6167 million of bank and commercial paper borrowings net in fiscal 2020 

• dividends paid were 9176 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 8563 million in fiscal 2020 and 

• there were no stock repurchases in fiscal 2021 cash paid for treasury stock repurchases was 8447 million in fiscal 2020 

we repaid senior notes in the amount of 13 billion purchased senior notes and debentures in the amount of 7124 million pursuant to a tender offer in fiscal 2021 and repaid 700 million of borrowings under our longterm revolving credit facility utilizing cash flow from operations 

in response to the covid19 pandemic and its impact on our working capital as well as the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate cash flow in the near term we took steps to increase our liquidity in the second half of fiscal 2020 including the issuance of senior notes borrowings under our longterm revolving credit facility and borrowings under a uk commercial paper program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we entered into an amendment to our longterm revolving credit facility which required us to suspend share repurchases and dividend increases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we further amended our longterm revolving credit facility to increase the authorized dividend per share amount which allowed us to declare a dividend increase of 002 per share resulting in a quarterly cash dividend of 047 per share payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 in fiscal 2021 we continued to reduce our debt levels and have paid down 34 billion of debt as of july 3 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under our longterm revolving credit facility as of august 10 2021 the company has approximately 47 billion in cash and available liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

• working capital requirements 

• capital investments in facilities systems fleet other equipment and technology 

• cash dividends 

• acquisitions consistent with our growth strategy 

• debt repayments 

• share repurchases and 

• contributions to our various retirement plans 

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we continue to be in a strong financial position based on our balance sheet and operating cash flows however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as actively working with customers to receive payments on receivables optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations 

we extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer’s creditworthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary in the ordinary course of business customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable the company may utilize purchase arrangements with thirdparty financial institutions to transfer portions of our trade accounts receivable balance on a nonrecourse basis in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow the arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales see note 1 “summary of accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

as of july 3 2021 we had 30 billion in cash and cash equivalents approximately 19 of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to withholding and additional foreign tax obligations additionally sysco corporation has provided intercompany loans to certain of its international subsidiaries and when interest and principal payments are made some of this cash will move to the us 

our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive must maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund future reserve payments as of july 3 2021 the captive held 1297 million of fixed income marketable securities and 300 million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in a restricted investment portfolio in order to meet solvency requirements we purchased 531 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2021 and received 360 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities in that period 

cash requirements 

the company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable and accrued liabilities current maturities of longterm debt other current liabilities and purchase commitments and other obligations we expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets 

our longterm cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include 

• debt obligations and interest payments – see note 12 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further detail of our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments 

• operating and finance leases – see note 13 “leases” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments 

• deferred compensation – the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan and management savings plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement ages and payout periods see note 14 “companysponsored employee benefit plans” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments 

• purchase and other obligations – purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed including minimum quantities resulting from our category management process such amounts are based on estimates purchase obligations also include amounts committed with various thirdparty service providers to provide information technology services for periods up to fiscal 2026 see discussion under note 20 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 

• other liabilities – these include other longterm liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of july 3 2021 including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs unrecognized tax benefits and various longterm liabilities which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments 

• contingent consideration – certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only if certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved see note 4 “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july 3 2021 

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

• our cash flows from operations 

• the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs supported by our revolving credit facility and 

• our ability to access capital from financial markets including issuances of debt securities either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec 

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary 

cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated 19 billion and 16 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively fiscal 2021 reflects higher operating results as well as yearoveryear favorable comparisons on accrued expenses income taxes and working capital 

the positive impact from accrued expenses was primarily due to a favorable comparison of customer rebate payments resulting from an increase in volume purchase incentives earned by our customers as sales volumes increased throughout fiscal 2021 and a favorable comparison of incentive payments resulting from prior year incentive payments exceeding current payments coupled with an increase in incentive accruals in fiscal 2021 due to improved business performance 

income tax cash payments decreased 2731 million yearoveryear this was a result of higher accrual of earnings in fiscal 2019 and the beginning of fiscal 2020 used to calculate estimated tax payments in fiscal 2020 lower earnings at the end of fiscal 2020 and in fiscal 2021 including the impact of the debt tender in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 resulted in lower estimated tax payments for fiscal 2021 additionally in fiscal 2021 we received a 50 million refund related to a payment made in fiscal 2020 

changes in working capital had a positive impact of 493 million on cash flow from operations periodoverperiod there was a favorable comparison on accounts payable partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on accounts receivable and inventories accounts payable and inventories have increased as we continue our business recovery efforts and investments in inventory in the second half of fiscal 2021 we invested heavily in inventory and we ended the fiscal year with inventory onhand and inventory onorder in a combined amount that exceeds our precovid19 levels which should enable us to ship product on time and in full during the upcoming period of expected volume recovery the unfavorable comparison in cash flows from accounts receivables is primarily due to our customers beginning to purchase more in the second half of fiscal 2021 coupled with significantly lower sales in the latter half of fiscal 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic in fiscal 2021 we recorded a net credit to the provision for losses on receivables totaling 1527 million which reflects a benefit on the reduction of our allowance for prepandemic receivable balances as we have made excellent progress on obtaining timely payments from our customers we continue to work with our customers to collect past due balances including through the use of payment plans we have also discontinued charging interest on past due balances 

the positive impacts to cash flows from operating activities noted above were partially offset by an unfavorable comparison yearoveryear with regard to the provision for losses on trade receivables during fiscal 2021 we recognized a net benefit on our allowance for credit losses on receivables due to improved collections on sysco’s prepandemic receivables as compared to the excess bad debt charges recognized in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our customers 

investing activities 

fiscal 2021 capital expenditures included 

• buildings and building improvements 

• investments in technology 

• warehouse equipment and 

• fleet replacements 

fiscal 2020 capital expenditures included 

• buildings and building improvements 

• fleet replacements 

• investments in technology and 

• warehouse equipment 

the level of gross capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 decreased 2497 million as compared to fiscal 2020 we reduced our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 by eliminating capital projects that were not critical for our business in order to preserve our liquidity in response to the covid19 crisis we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2022 will be approximately 13 of fiscal 2022 sales as we continue to invest in our business for the longterm 

fiscal 2022 expenditures are expected to include facility expansions and new facility construction fleet and other equipment purchases including replacements and investments in technology 

during fiscal 2020 the company paid cash of 1428 million for acquisitions net of cash acquired including the acquisitions of j kings food service professionals armstrong produce and kula produce 

free cash flow 

our free cash flow for fiscal 2021 increased by 5653 million to 15 billion as compared to fiscal 2020 principally as a result of an increase in cash flows from operations and yearoveryear decreased capital expenditures 

nongaap reconciliation 

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable gaap measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap see “key performance indicators” for further discussion regarding this nongaap financial measure in the table that follows free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 



financing activities 

equity transactions 

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 1304 million and 2276 million in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire 

we have traditionally engaged in share repurchase programs to allow sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases in august 2019 our board of directors approved a repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 25 billion of the company’s common stock through the end of fiscal 2021 during march 2020 we discontinued share repurchases under the program and pursuant to the amendment to our longterm revolving credit facility as described below under “debt activity and borrowing availability” we repurchased no shares during fiscal 2021 compared to 111 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2020 for 8447 million the remaining authorization of approximately 21 billion expired at the end of fiscal 2021 in may 2021 our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 50 billion of the company’s common stock which will remain available until fully utilized 

certain conditions would need to be present for us to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2022 including but not limited to the following the market recovery must be robust our investments in our business must be fully funded including acquisitions our debt reduction must continue and our investment grade credit rating must be preserved and excess liquidity must exist to fund the repurchase program if current trends continue with respect to each of these conditions and our balanced capital allocation strategy is employed we may return more capital to shareholders through share repurchases in fiscal 2022 

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception dividends paid were 9176 million or 180 per share in fiscal 2021 and 8563 million or 168 per share in fiscal 2020 in may 2021 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 of 047 per share a 002 per share increase from the prior quarter which was paid in july 2021 

in august 2018 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities the 

specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement which we expect to replace with a new universal shelf registration statement to be filed shortly after this form 10k will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 10 2021 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

debt activity and borrowing availability 

our debt activity including issuances and repayments and our borrowing availability is described in note 12 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 our outstanding borrowings at july 3 2021 and repayment activity since the end of fiscal 2021 are disclosed within those notes updated amounts at august 10 2021 include 

• no outstanding borrowings from the credit facility supporting our us commercial paper program and 

• no outstanding borrowings under our us commercial paper program 

our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 097 for fiscal 2021 and 199 for fiscal 2020 

in the next 12 months 450 million of longterm debt will mature we expect to repay these senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and to fund this repayment with internally generated funds 

the availability of financing in the form of debt is influenced by many factors including our profitability free cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets as of august 10 2021 the company had approximately 47 billion in cash and available liquidity 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to worsening business conditions sysco entered into an amendment to its 2 billion longterm revolving credit facility that expires on june 28 2024 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 due to improving business conditions we further amended our longterm revolving credit facility to 1 adjust the covenant restricting increases to sysco’s regular quarterly dividend to enable future increases 2 remove access to a 364day credit facility that the company believes it no longer needs and 3 adjust the covenant requiring sysco to maintain a certain ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense as of july 3 2021 sysco was in compliance with all of its debt covenants and the company expects to remain in compliance through the next twelve months 

guarantor summarized financial information 

on january 19 2011 the wholly owned us broadline subsidiaries of sysco corporation which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of sysco corporation a list of the current guarantors is included in exhibit 22 to this form 10k all subsequent issuances of senior notes and debentures in the us and borrowings under the company’s 20 billion longterm revolving credit facility have also been guaranteed by these subsidiaries as discussed in note 12 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 as of july 3 2021 sysco had a total of 106 billion in senior notes debentures and borrowings under the longterm revolving credit facility that were guaranteed by these subsidiary guarantors our remaining consolidated subsidiaries nonguarantor subsidiaries are not obligated under the senior notes indenture debentures indenture or our longterm revolving credit facility 

all subsidiary guarantors are 100 owned by the parent company all guarantees are full and unconditional and all guarantees are joint and several the guarantees rank equally and ratably in right of payment with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the respective guarantors 

the assets of sysco corporation consist principally of the stock of its subsidiaries therefore the rights of sysco corporation and the rights of its creditors to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation recapitalization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors except to the extent that claims of sysco corporation itself andor the claims of those creditors themselves may be recognized as creditor claims of the subsidiary furthermore the ability of sysco corporation to service its indebtedness and other obligations is dependent upon the earnings and cash flow of its subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment to it of such earnings or cash flow if any of sysco corporation’s 

subsidiaries becomes insolvent the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on its assets sysco corporation’s rights and the rights of its creditors including the rights of a holder of senior notes as an owner of debt securities will be subject to that prior claim unless sysco corporation or such noteholder if such noteholder’s debt securities are guaranteed by such subsidiary also is a direct creditor of that subsidiary 

the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor with respect to a series of senior notes or debentures may be released under certain customary circumstances if we exercise our defeasance option with respect to the senior notes or debentures of any series then any subsidiary guarantor effectively will be released with respect to that series further each subsidiary guarantee will remain in full force and effect until the earliest to occur of the date if any on which 1 the applicable subsidiary guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into sysco corporation or any successor of sysco corporation or 2 sysco corporation or any successor of sysco corporation consolidates with or merges into the applicable subsidiary guarantor

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the goodwill and intangible assets allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes sharebased compensation and companysponsored pension plans 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values we use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we generally use the income method which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill more information on our acquisitions can be found in note 4 “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

annually in our fiscal fourth quarter we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets impairment reviews outside our annual review time frame are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment however if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is performed 

when using a quantitative test we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit we use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 

certain reporting units have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

in the annual fiscal 2021 assessment certain reporting units did not have a fair value substantially in excess of their book value for two reporting units with goodwill of 1814 million in the aggregate as of july 3 2021 headroom was considered low at 18 and 27 all other reporting units were concluded to have a fair value that exceeded book value by at least 30 

the company estimated the fair value of these reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models for the purposes of the discounted cash flow models fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate the fair value conclusions as of july 3 2021 for the reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the income approach which include forecasted revenues perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others all of which require significant judgments by management fair value of the reporting unit is therefore determined using significant unobservable inputs or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy the company has used recent historical performance current forecasted financial information and broadbased industry and economic statistics as a basis to estimate the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model these key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and judgment and are subject to change based on future changes industry and global economic and geopolitical conditions and the timing and success of the implementation of current strategic initiatives the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on estimated future cash flows is uncertain and will largely depend on the outcome of future events which could result in goodwill impairments going forward 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

sysco determines the past due status of trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer and evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable to determine an appropriate allowance for credit losses on trade receivables to calculate an allowance for credit losses the company estimates uncollectible amounts based on historical loss experience including those experienced during times of local and regional disasters current conditions and collection rates and expectations regarding future losses 

in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 the company experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges on its trade receivables that were outstanding at the time the pandemic caused closures among our customers in midmarch 2020 these receivables were all created in fiscal 2020 and are referred to as prepandemic receivables in fiscal 2021 we recorded a net credit to the provision for losses on receivables totaling 1527 million which reflects a benefit on the reduction of our allowance for prepandemic receivable balances as we have made excellent progress on obtaining timely payments from our customers we continue to work with our customers to collect past due balances including through the use of payment plans we have also discontinued charging interest on past due balances our balance for the allowance of doubtful accounts as of july 3 2021 was 1177 million the covid19 pandemic is more widespread and longer in duration than historical disasters that have impacted our business and it is possible that actual uncollectible amounts will differ and additional charges may be required however if collections continue to improve it is also possible that additional reductions in our bad debt reserve could occur our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions tax law changes increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate the impact of the covid19 pandemic may change our mix of earnings by jurisdiction and has increased the risk that operating losses may occur within certain of our jurisdictions that could lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if these losses are prolonged beyond our current expectations this would negatively impact our income tax expense net earnings and balance sheet 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

sharebased compensation 

sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans a nonemployee director plan and the 2015 employee stock purchase plan espp 

as of july 3 2021 there was 1244 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 17 years 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award and performance share unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units and performance share units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period expense recognized on performance share unit awards is subsequently adjusted based on forecasted performance compared to planned targets until the performance period concludes and the actual number of shares of sysco common stock to be received upon the vesting of the performance share units is known 

the fair value of the stock issued under the espp is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or nonemployee directors is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the espp is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

our sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our us retirement plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees our serp is frozen and is not open to any employees none of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates specific to our results of operations but such changes could impact our balance sheet due to a 

change in our funded status due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is not a critical assumption 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan is 475 for fiscal 2021 consistent with fiscal 2020 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan decreased by 25 basis points to 450 for fiscal 2022 due to expected lower longterm rate of return a 25 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return in the plan for fiscal 2022 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2022 by approximately 11 million 

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 3 2021 was a charge net of tax of 11 billion driven by an increase in the discount rates and a decline in expected return on assets the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 27 2020 was a charge net of tax of 13 billion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risks consist of interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk fuel price risk and investment risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

at july 3 2021 there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding under our us commercial paper program total debt as of july 3 2021 was 111 billion of which approximately 90 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

at june 27 2020 there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding under our us commercial paper program and we had £6000 million outstanding under our uk commercial paper program total debt as of june 27 2020 was 144 billion of which approximately 79 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

details of our outstanding swap agreements as of july 3 2021 are below 



we receive or pay amounts on these interest rate swap agreements on a semiannual basis 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of july 3 2021 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents

rate a – threemonth libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our largest currency exposures are with canadian dollars british pound sterling and euro currencies our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively affected sales by 09 in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 the exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively affected sales by 03 in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020 a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2021 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively affected fiscal 2021 sales by 13 and would not have materially affected our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our investments and loans to our foreign operations created additional foreign currency exposure in fiscal 2017 we designated €500 million of euro notes issued in june 2016 as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in eurodenominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations changes in the value of these items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to us dollar exchange rates are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 05 of sales during fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges that primarily track with the change in market prices of fuel we use diesel fuel swap contracts to fix the price of a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of july 3 2021 we had diesel fuel swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 32 million gallons through june 2022 these swaps are expected to lock in the price of approximately 50 of our projected fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2022 our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 71 million in our fuel costs on our noncontracted volumes 

investment risk 

our us retirement plan holds various investments including public and private equity fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plans at the plans’ fiscal year end december 31 2020 would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2022 however such an unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2022 by 358 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of july 3 2021 by 4655 million

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 



1 other sales relate to nonfood products including textiles and amenities for our hotel supply business equipment and subscription sales for our sysco labs business and other janitorial products medical supplies and smallwares 

our distribution centers which we refer to as operating companies distribute branded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing customer service and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice 

distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various thirdparty services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended june 27 2020 

we estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 



1 other includes cafeterias that are not standalone restaurants bakeries caterers churches civic and fraternal organizations vending distributors other distributors and international exports as well as retail food sales and logistics services none of these types of customers as a group exceeded 5 of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our industry and business have been negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic in response to the covid19 pandemic governmental authorities in many countries in which we operate and in which our customers are present and suppliers operate have imposed mandatory closures sought voluntary closures and imposed restrictions on or advisories with respect to travel business operations and public gatherings or interactions among other matters these actions have required or strongly urged various venues where foodservice products are served including restaurants schools hotels and cruise liners to reduce or discontinue operations which have negatively affected demand in the foodservice industry including demand for our products and services our industry is considered an essential service so we have continued to operate immediately after the onset of the crisis sysco took action to ensure liquidity reduce variable and structural costs and pivot our business to maximize sales during a period of disruption 

during the last couple of weeks of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our business declined significantly from the time that shelter in place orders were issued in response to the covid19 pandemic we experienced declines in sales to the majority of our customers with the exception of certain customers in the healthcare segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 however we experienced sequential weekly improvements with the reopening of inrestaurant dining the “exit rate” of our sales as of the end of fiscal 2020 was a decline of approximately 30 compared to the end of fiscal 2019 in july 2020 as covid19 cases began increasing in certain locations the business recovery flattened however we have experienced weekly improvements in sales again in august 2020 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers we also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to midsized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products our locally sourced products including produce meats cheese and other products help differentiate our customers’ offerings satisfy demands for new products and support local communities purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs domestically and internationally and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies 

through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds we continue to be in a strong financial position based on our balance sheet and our operating cash flows however our liquidity and capital resources have been significantly and negatively impacted by the reduction in sales volume resulting from the covid19 pandemic our working capital needs have been reduced and continue to decline due to decreased demand and we are actively working with customers to receive payments on receivables optimizing our inventory levels and maximizing our payment terms with vendors we believe these actions will help to partially offset the unfavorable impact of the covid19 pandemic on our cash flows from operations 

we extend credit terms to our customers that can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly up to 65 days 

corporate headquarters 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies and performs support activities for employees suppliers and customers members of this group possess experience and expertise in among other areas customer and vendor contract administration accounting and finance treasury legal information technology payroll and employee benefits risk management and insurance sales and marketing merchandising inbound logistics human resources strategy and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available supply chain expertise such as in warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 7204 million 6924 million and 6878 million respectively were invested in facilities delivery fleet technology and other capital asset enhancements from time to time we dispose of assets in the normal course of business we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets were 6917 million 6715 million and 6656 million respectively capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 were 13 11 and 11 respectively in order to preserve our liquidity in response to the covid19 crisis we have reduced our expected capital expenditures by eliminating capital projects that are not urgently needed for our business and were not significantly underway during the three years ended june 27 2020 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2021 capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

as of june 27 2020 we had approximately 57000 employees approximately 24 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 24 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or will expire during fiscal 2021 and are subject to renegotiation since june 27 2020 there have been 7 contract renegotiations we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

competition 

a large number of companies are engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores online retailers or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors some organizations compete with us on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently product needs service requirements and price are just a few of the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly there are few barriers to market entry existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers 

we estimate that we serve about 16 of an approximately 310 billion annual foodservice market in the united states us based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2019 based on industry data obtained from technomic inc we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2020 while comprehensive industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our operations in the us and canada are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in those trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our sales consultants our diversified product base which includes qualityassured sysco brand products the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis and our multiregional presence in north america and europe which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time 

the covid19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in consumption within the foodservice market and may create a longterm change in customer demand as purchases have shifted more to the retail grocery channel the foodawayfromhome market fell to a low of 32 of total dollars spent on food purchases as a result of the pandemic but has since recovered to approximately 43 as of june 2020 we expect real sales growth in the us foodservice market to be negative for calendar year 2020 

we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements there are a small number of companies competing in the foodawayfromhome industry in the us with publicly traded equity while our public company status provides us with some advantages over many of our competitors including access to capital we believe it also puts us at a disadvantage in that most of our competitors do not face the obligations and additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements applicable to public companies 

government regulation 

our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business 

in the us as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda the fda regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements

we and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute we are also subject to the national labor relations act which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace

our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate including the sherman antitrust act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the us these laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices boycotting competitors or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition in many jurisdictions compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions 

outside the us our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations as well as other legal and regulatory requirements for example we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the european union the eu as well as those of eu countries where we conduct business including the uk ireland france and sweden which requirements relate to among other things competition product composition packaging labeling advertisement including nutrition and health claims and the safety of food products as well as the health safety and working conditions of employees we are subject to privacy laws in the eu including the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data in addition our business is subject to the uk modern slavery act 2015 which requires certain companies that operate in the uk to prepare a report describing steps that they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their supply chain or business our business is also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 an anticorruption law that criminalizes the failure by a company to prevent persons

general 

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco® and brakes® trademarks in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry both our us and european trademarks are effective for a tenyear period and we generally renew our trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use we believe the loss of the sysco® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we do not have any material patents or licenses 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore our business is not deemed to be seasonal

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and from historical trends 

industry and general economic risks 

global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

public health crises pandemics and epidemics such as the recent outbreak of covid19 have impacted our operations directly and are expected to continue to impact us directly or may continue to disrupt the operations of our business partners suppliers and customers in ways that could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition fear of such events may further alter consumer confidence behavior and spending patterns and could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries or globally resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers’ demand for our products 

in response to the recent outbreak of covid19 and its development into a pandemic governmental authorities in many countries in which we operate and in which our customers are present and suppliers operate have imposed mandatory closures sought voluntary closures and imposed restrictions on or advisories with respect to travel business operations and public gatherings or interactions among other matters these actions have required or strongly urged various venues where foodservice products are served including restaurants schools hotels and cruise liners to reduce or discontinue operations 

which have adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect demand in the foodservice industry including demand for our products and services in addition some consumers are choosing to stay home due to the perceived risk of infection and health risk associated with covid19 which is adversely affecting demand in the foodservice industry including demand for our products and services 

these events have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business financial condition and results of operations including but not limited to our growth product costs supply chain disruptions and the potential for inventory spoilage labor shortages logistics constraints customer demand for our products and industry demand generally difficulties in collecting our accounts receivables and corresponding increases in our bad debt exposure consumer spending our liquidity the price of our securities and trading markets with respect thereto our ability to access capital markets and the global economy and financial markets generally a prolonged or deeper economic downturn that adversely affects our business financial condition or results of operations could affect our ability to access the credit markets for additional liquidity a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital as a result we may be unable to continue to comply with the debt covenants that are specific to our revolving credit facility which could result in an event of default we may see an increase in bankruptcies of customers which could contribute to an increase in bad debt expense recorded in fiscal 2021 we experienced an increase in past due receivables and recognized additional bad debt charges of 3234 million specific to the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2020 total bad debt expense for fiscal 2020 was 4042 million additionally these events caused us to incur 703 million in severance expenses during the second half of fiscal 2020 related to actions to reduce our workforce through the implementation of hiring freezes furloughs and other headcount reductions as well as goodwill impairment charges of 2032 million 

we have implemented employee safety measures based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing mask use and temperature screenings these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid19 among our employees illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain distribution or other business processes we may face additional production disruptions in the future which may place constraints on our ability to distribute products in a timely manner or may increase our costs 

the ultimate extent of the impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend largely on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the us and europe and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we could experience a longerterm impact on our business such as costs associated with enhanced health safety and hygiene requirements in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks or the possibility that venues where foodservice products are served are slow to reopen andor experience reduced customer traffic after reopening 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic may change our mix of earnings by jurisdiction and has increased the risk that operating losses may occur within certain of our jurisdictions that could lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if these losses are prolonged beyond our current expectations this would negatively impact our income tax expense net earnings and balance sheet 

sustained adverse impacts to our company certain suppliers and customers may also affect our future valuation of certain assets and therefore may increase the likelihood of an impairment charge writeoff or reserve associated with such assets including goodwill longlived intangible assets property and equipment inventories accounts receivable tax assets and other assets 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k such as those relating to our level of indebtedness and may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

our industry is characterized by low margins and periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of significant product cost inflation may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers in a timely manner in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may adversely affect our business due to the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive 

environment conversely our business may be adversely affected by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our results of operations may be adversely affected during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in north america and europe as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the foodservice industry is characterized by relatively low profit margins consequently our results of operations are susceptible to regional national and international economic trends and uncertainties economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

• unfavorable conditions can depress sales andor gross margins in a given market 

• food cost and fuel cost inflation experienced by the consumer can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases which could negatively impact our business by reducing demand for our products 

• heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affects consumer confidence and discretionary spending which can cause disruptions with our customers and suppliers 

• liquidity issues and the inability of our customers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct daytoday transactions involving the collection of funds from such customers 

• liquidity issues and the inability of our suppliers to consistently access credit markets to obtain cash to support their operations can cause temporary interruptions in our ability to obtain the foodservice products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request 

historically north america and europe have experienced from time to time including during the covid19 pandemic deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in their financial markets which have adversely impacted business and consumer confidence and spending and depressed capital investment and economic activity in the affected regions if similar unfavorable economic conditions were to arise in the future or recent volatility in the financial markets and the global economy were to continue our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to certain risks including economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets in which we operate for example the uk’s exit from the eu which occurred on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and the resulting significant change to the uk’s relationship with the eu and with countries outside the eu and the laws regulations and trade deals impacting business conducted between them could disrupt the overall economic growth or stability of the uk and the eu and otherwise negatively impact our european operations 

the withdrawal agreement between the uk and the eu that establishes the terms governing the uk’s departure provides that among other things there is an ongoing transition period under which the uk remains a part of the eu customs and regulatory area until december 31 2020 during this time the uk and the eu are negotiating their future trading relationship which under current uk government policy is anticipated to take the form of a free trade agreement as a result significant uncertainty remains as to the terms under which the uk will continue to trade with the eu after the end of the transition period it is possible that brexit will result in our uk and eu operations becoming subject to materially different and potentially conflicting laws regulations or tariffs which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices furthermore if the transition period were to expire without an agreement a “nodeal brexit” there may be additional adverse impacts on immigration and trade between the uk and the eu or countries outside the eu such impacts may directly increase our costs or could decrease demand for our goods and services by adversely impacting the business of restaurants or other customers in the foodservice distribution industry 

the completion of brexit could also adversely affect the value of our euro and pounddenominated assets and obligations exchange rates related to the british pound sterling have been more volatile since the uk announced it would exit the eu and such volatility may continue in the future future fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the local currencies of our suppliers may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the uk which increases we may not be able to pass on to our customers uncertainty surrounding brexit has contributed to recent fluctuations in the uk economy and could experience future disruptions in addition brexit could cause financial and capital markets 

within and outside the uk or the eu to constrict thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business and could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry any one of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

as an example of political instability in fiscal 2020 the “yellow vest” protests in france against a fuel tax increase pension reform and the french government negatively impacted our sales in france similarly future labor disruptions or disputes could disrupt the integration of brake france and davigel into sysco france and our operations in france and the eu generally in addition if changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods services and workers in either the uk or france or in other parts of the eu with respect to brexit or otherwise our european operations could also be negatively impacted 

competition and the impact of gpos may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional and multiregional distributors and specialty competitors local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach private label offerings overall purchasing power cost efficiencies and ability to meet customer distribution requirements these suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures online direct food wholesalers and cash and carry operations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

moreover some of our customers purchase their products from us through group purchasing organizations or “gpos” in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders gpos have a relatively larger presence in the healthcare lodging and foodservice management customer segments if these gpos are able to add a significant number of our customers as members it may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting or other concessions such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices which could also adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past through among other things our fuel surcharge program there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future if fuel costs increase in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements including fuel derivatives to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices nevertheless our fuel hedging transactions may not be effective in protecting us from changes in fuel prices and if fuel prices were to decrease significantly these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higherthanmarket costs for a portion of our diesel fuel in addition our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that any of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations whether due to its insolvency or otherwise which could result in financial losses 

business and operational risks 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies increase our product costs and impair our ability to deliver products and services to our customers  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not be able to provide the foodservice products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include shortages of qualified labor for our suppliers work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands civil insurrection or social unrest such as the recent protests and social movements across several north american cities terrorist attacks or international hostilities and natural disasters epidemics pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic or other human or animal disease outbreaks or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses many of these conditions outside of our control could also impair our ability to provide our products and services to our customers or increase the cost of doing so 

further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect demand for our products at any time input costs could increase for a prolonged period for a large portion of the products that we sell additionally we procure products from suppliers outside of the us and we are subject to the risks associated with political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade including health and safety restrictions related to epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic any or all of which could delay our receipt of products or increase our input costs 

our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products andor to timely provide our products and services and fulfill our other obligations to our customers whether as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as our customers may turn to other distributors 

in addition as a foodservice distributor it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase a product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory adversely affecting our results of operations 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business sysco’s brand names trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products whether or not justified including negative publicity about the quality safety sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to illegal or unethical activities by our employees suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis salmonella listeria or swine flu or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or reduce public confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers were to become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence in us and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for 

our products and services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time market competition customer requirements customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships we may not be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts that insolvent customers might owe us our customer agreements are generally terminable upon written notice by either us or the customer which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our anticipated change to the mix of locally managed customers versus multiunit customers could reduce our gross and operating margins 

gross margin from our multiunit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locally managed customers if sales to our locally managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multiunit customers our operating margins will likely decline meanwhile the covid19 pandemic generally has negatively affected multiunit customers less than locally managed customers this creates an opportunity for sysco to grow sales to multiunit customers which represents a strategy that sysco is actively pursuing to grow both sales and gross profit dollars in fiscal 2021 

moreover as our sales to multiunit customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally managed customers we will become more dependent on multiunit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales and therefore a future loss of sales to the larger of these multiunit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers they could pressure us to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases our results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in consumer eating habits such as a decline in consuming food away from home a decline in portion sizes or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers could reduce demand for our products consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods there is a growing consumer preference for sustainable organic and locally grown products and a shift towards plantbased proteins andor animal proteins derived from animals that were humanely treated and antibiotic free 

changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts millennials the largest demographic group in terms of spend seek new and different as well as more ethnic menu options and menu innovation if consumer eating habits change significantly we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio and we may experience higher costs andor supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to the new eating preferences changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home additionally changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products compliance with these laws and regulations as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products may be costly and timeconsuming we may not be able to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits 

in addition in response to the covid19 pandemic and the related economic downturn many consumers have preferred to eat at home rather than consume food away from home if these preferences continue and consumers continue to 

avoid gathering in public places in large groups the demand for our products and services could be adversely affected moreover once all governmental restrictions are lifted it is unclear how quickly customers will return to their prior eating habits which may be a function of continued concerns over safety or depressed consumer sentiment due to adverse economic conditions including job losses 

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful  

an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control public health crises epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example the us and many countries in the eu where we do business are actively considering or have recently enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified we are also subject to nonincomebased taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions although we believe that our income and nonincomebased tax estimates are appropriate there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

given the unpredictability of possible further changes to the us or foreign tax laws and regulations and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on our results of operations and cash flow but such laws and regulations and changes thereto could adversely impact our financial results 

if the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims 

we like any other foodservice distributor may be subject to product recalls including voluntary recalls or withdrawals if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness to have been mislabeled misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations we may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards whether for taste appearance or otherwise in order to protect our brand and reputation any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures destruction of product inventory damage to our reputation andor lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of products sold by sysco is alleged to have caused injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future 

or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image umbrella liability insurance that we maintain for product liability claims may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business  

we are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many aspects of our business such as food safety and sanitation ethical business practices transportation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs for a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject please refer to “business – government regulation” in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we may not be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times moreover we may not be able to comply with all future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance 

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

• the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water 

• the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes 

• employee exposure to hazards in the workplace and 

• the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials 

in the course of our operations we operate maintain and fuel fleet vehicles store fuel in onsite above and underground storage tanks operate refrigeration systems and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes we could incur substantial costs including fines or penalties and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment in addition we could incur investigation remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties 

for example most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks certain of these laws and regulations in the eu may impose liability for costs of investigation or remediation of contamination which could be material regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal and even if such contamination was present 

prior to the commencement of our operations at the site and was not caused by our activities in addition many of our facilities have propane and batterypowered forklifts proposed or recently enacted legal requirements such as those requiring the phaseout of certain ozonedepleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may require us to upgrade or replace equipment or may increase our transportation or other operating costs 

if we are unable to finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively our earnings per share could be materially adversely affected  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected for example we encountered operational challenges in fiscal 2019 in connection with our efforts to integrate two businesses in france acquired in connection with the brakes group acquisition which integration efforts have adversely affected our ability to drive growth in sales integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s 

a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments in addition our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with respect to a significant acquired business could result in material weaknesses andor a failure to file our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission on a timely basis 

we need access to borrowed funds to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

as described in note 13 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 as of june 27 2020 we had approximately 144 billion of total indebtedness this amount included senior notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which supports our us commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 20 billion scheduled to expire on june 28 2024 and issuances under a new unrelated commercial paper program in the uk allowing the company to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed £600 million we also have available a 364day credit facility in the amount of 7500 million scheduled to expire on may 19 2021 and various other smaller bank facilities 

certain covenants under our credit facilities place restrictions on some of the actions we may take with respect to our common stock in may 2020 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit agreement that among other things added a new covenant that restricts 1 increases to sysco’s regular quarterly dividend and 2 repurchases of equity interests of sysco in each case until the earlier of september 2022 or the date on which sysco has achieved a certain ratio of consolidated earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for us including 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing if needed for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other purposes 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures potential acquisitions joint ventures andor share repurchase programs our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of 

future debt financing and financial results and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

changes in the method of determining london interbank offered rate libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt 

amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to libor depending on our selection of repayment options in addition certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to threemonth libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve is considering replacing us dollar libor with a newly created index called the broad treasury financing rate calculated with a broad set of shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate the credit facility and any interest rate swap agreements expiring after 2021 and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us the overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the credit facility or our interest rate swap agreements with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results 

we rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis we also use mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and customers further our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners 

these technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters power outages systems failures security breaches espionage cyberattacks viruses theft and inadvertent release of information in particular we have experienced and continue to experience cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers including viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic is introducing additional cybersecurity risk as a result of our employees contractors and other corporate partners working remotely due to the increased remote workforce we must increasingly rely on information technology systems that are outside our direct control these systems are potentially vulnerable to cyberbased attacks and security breaches in addition cyber criminals are increasing their attacks on individual employees utilizing interest in pandemicrelated information to increase business email compromise scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds or steal credentials that compromise information systems 

to date these cybersecurity threats have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include business disruption disruption to systems theft destruction loss corruption misappropriation or unauthorized release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property including personal information in violation of one or more privacy laws reputational and brand damage and potential liability including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition by governmental authorities of penalties fines fees or liabilities which in turn could cause us to incur significantly increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs and the loss of customers 

the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing to date or which we seek to cause or have caused third party service providers to implement may be insufficient to protect our systems information or other intellectual property further we anticipate devoting significant additional resources to upgrade our security measures generally including those we employ to protect personal information against these cybersecurity threats 

due to the evolving nature of these cybersecurity threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted with certainty but such an incident could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition especially if the amount of insurance coverage we maintain is not sufficient to cover claims or liabilities relating to the incident 

further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk failure to adequately assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives would increase our vulnerability to such risks 

sysco’s efforts to prevent security breaches and cybersecurity incidents and to implement effective disaster recovery plans may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations additionally information technology systems continue to evolve and in order to remain competitive we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner if our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we do business for example the eu adopted the gdpr a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data we are working to comply with gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area that apply to us such as california’s consumer privacy act that became effective january 1 2020 and we anticipate needing to devote significant additional resources to complying with these laws and regulations our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area could result in substantial fines or penalties and legal liability and could tarnish our reputation 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 11 of our current us employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2020 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 474 million the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan we could also be treated as partially withdrawing from participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain percentage over a certain period of time such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations such as facility closures or consolidations based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 1608 million as of june 27 2020 a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

at the end of fiscal 2012 we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan us retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 50 billion as of june 27 2020 therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements see note 15 “companysponsored employee benefit plans” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the us retirement plan 

the amount of our annual contribution to the us retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the us retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability in fiscal 2018 we made voluntary contributions of 380 million to the us retirement plan allowing us to set an investment strategy that more closely aligns the duration of the us retirement plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities as a result our us retirement plan holds a greater amount of investments in fixed income securities but also holds equity securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the us retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience significant future declines andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

as of june 27 2020 we had approximately 57000 employees approximately 24 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 24 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or will expire during fiscal 2021 and are subject to renegotiation failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability and the ability of third parties on which we rely to supply and to deliver our products to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly adversely affect our business employee recruitment development and retention efforts undertaken by us andor such thirdparties may not be successful resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods any such shortage could decrease our ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties and a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and are impacted by restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives 2 severance and facility closure charges and 3 restructuring charges all acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 that have been designated as certain items relate to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of cucina lux investments limited the brakes acquisition these include acquisitionrelated intangible amortization expense fiscal 2020 results of operations were also negatively impacted by costs arising from the covid19 pandemic the most significant including 1 excess bad debt expense 2 goodwill and intangibles impairment charges and 3 fixed asset impairment charges these are the only items that have been adjusted as certain items our adjusted results have not been normalized in a manner that would exclude the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

as such sysco has not adjusted its results for lost sales inventory writeoffs or other costs associated with the covid19 pandemic many of sysco’s customers including those in the restaurant hospitality and education segments are closed or operating at a substantially reduced volume due to governmental requirements for closures or other socialdistancing measures some of these customers have ceased paying their outstanding receivables creating uncertainty as to their collectability we have experienced an increase in past due receivables and have recognized additional bad debt charges prior to the covid19 pandemic our allowance was primarily based on historical loss experience since the crisis began our writeoff percentages have been based not only on historical loss experience but also on our experience with losses incurred during times of local and regional disasters additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we included the company’s current collection experience which has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic we anticipate continuing this approach in fiscal 2021 the covid19 pandemic is more widespread and longer in duration than historical disasters impacting our business and it is possible that actual uncollectible amounts will differ and additional charges may be required in fiscal 2021 while sysco traditionally incurs bad debt expense the magnitude of such expenses that we have experienced since march 2020 is not indicative of our normal operations 

fiscal 2019 results of operations were impacted by a gain on the sale of iowa premium llc iowa premium in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 in addition fiscal 2019 results of operations were affected by acquisitionrelated integration costs specific to the brakes acquisition and the impact of recognizing a foreign tax credit fiscal 2018 results of operations were additionally impacted by multiemployer pension plan mepp withdrawal charges these fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 items are collectively referred to as “certain items” the results of our foreign operations can be impacted by changes in exchange rates applicable to converting from local currencies to us dollars we measure our international foodservice operations results on a constant currency basis our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from certain items and certain metrics are stated on a constant currency basis 

management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income other income expense net net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations 2 facilitates comparisons on a yearoveryear basis and 3 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that as a result are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity 

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the table below each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above in the table below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding 

any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of certain items more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 sysco revised the way performance is assessed for the us foodservice operations segment as a result of this change charges incurred by the company’s corporate office to provide direct support functions to the us foodservice operations reportable segment have been reclassified from corporate expenses into the us foodservice reportable segment the segment information disclosed for fiscal 2020 reflects this change in reporting structure and prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation the following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 have been included for our us foodservice operations and corporate expenses disclosures around this change in segment reporting are described under “overview” below and in note 22 “business segment information” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 all other discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 has been omitted from this form 10k but may be found in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 29 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 26 2019 

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe the company has aggregated certain operating segments into three reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

• us foodservice operations – primarily includes us broadline operations which distribute a full line of food products including customcut meat seafood specialty produce specialty imports and a wide variety of nonfood products 

• international foodservice operations – includes operations in the americas and europe which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products the americas primarily consists of operations in canada bahamas mexico costa rica and panama as well as our operations that distribute to international customers our european operations primarily consist of operations in the uk france ireland and sweden 

• sygma – our us customized distribution subsidiary and 

• other – primarily our hotel supply operations 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 sysco revised the way performance is assessed for the us foodservice operations segment as a result of the change the company’s corporate expenses that were incurred to provide direct support functions to the us foodservice operations reportable segment have been reclassified from corporate expenses into the reportable segment the segment information disclosed for fiscal 2020 reflects this change in reporting structure and the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 results reflect  2010 million and  1970 million of corporate expense reclassifications respectively to conform with the current year presentation 

we estimate that we serve about 16 of an approximately 310 billion annual foodservice market in the us based on industry data obtained from technomic inc from time to time technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and as a result our percentage can change not only from our sales results but also from such revisions we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share 

according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 53 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar year 2019 industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the us experienced a real sales increase of approximately 09 in calendar year 2019 and 12 in calendar year 2018 real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation the covid19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in consumption within the foodservice market and may create a longterm change in customer demand as purchases have shifted more to the retail grocery channel the foodawayfromhome market fell to a low of 32 of total dollars spent on food purchases as a result of the pandemic but has since recovered to approximately 43 as of june 2020 we expect real sales growth in the us foodservice market to be negative for calendar year 2020 

key performance indicators 

sysco seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success in its key performance metrics that drive stakeholder value through sales growth and capital allocation and deployment we believe the following are our most significant performance metrics 

• adjusted operating income growth and adjusted operating income leverage nongaap 

• adjusted diluted earnings per share growth nongaap 

• case volume growth by customer type for us broadline operations 

• sysco brand penetration for us broadline operations 

• free cash flow nongaap and 

• adjusted return on invested capital nongaap 

we use these financial metrics and related computations as well as sales and gross profit growth to evaluate our business and to plan for nearand longterm operating and strategic decisions we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business 

key financial definitions 

• sales – sales is equal to gross sales minus 1 sales returns and 2 sales incentives that we offer to certain customers such as upfront monies and discounts our sales are driven by changes in case volumes product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products and mix of products sold 

• gross profit – gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs net of supplier consideration and inbound freight cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes 

adjusted operating income adjusted operating income leverage and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth 

adjusted operating income represents our consolidated operating income adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance adjusted operating income leverage represents the variance between our gross profit growth financial measure on a percentage basis and our adjusted operating expense growth on a percentage basis where management expects gross profit growth to exceed adjusted operating expense growth adjusted diluted earnings per share represents our consolidated diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider representative of our underlying performance sysco’s management considers growth in these metrics to be useful measures of operating efficiency and profitability as they facilitate comparison of performance on a consistent basis from period to period by providing a measurement of recurring factors and trends affecting our business 

case volume growth by customer type for us broadline operations 

case volume represents the volume of product sold to customers during a period of time and improvements in this metric are a primary driver of sysco’s top line performance we define a case specifically for our us broadline operations as the lowest level of packaged products that are sold from our warehouses with one case potentially containing several pieces of a product packaged in bulk case size does not generally vary by location or from period to period due to the design of our warehouses case volume growth is calculated by dividing the change in the volume of cases sold yearoveryear by the volume of cases sold in the prior year sysco management considers case volume growth within its us broadline operations to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating sales performance and as an indicator of gross margin performance management monitors case volume growth by customer type with bifurcation between local customers and national customers as this provides a measure of gross profit performance due to the pricing strategies attached to each customer type local customers are primarily street customers such as independent restaurants that do not have longterm contracts or locally managed customers such as local chain restaurants while national customers are the multiunit customers requiring national coverage from a customercentric view and are managed centrally from the corporate office sysco management seeks to drive higher case volume growth to local customers which allows more favorable pricing terms for our us broadline operations and generates higher gross margins as a result national customers benefit from purchasing power as they are able to negotiate pricing agreements across multiple businesses reducing our gross profit potential but reducing our overall cost per case as national customers have bigger drop sizes while overall case volume growth reflects a key component of sales growth local customer case growth provides additional context around gross profit performance 

sysco brand penetration for us broadline operations 

sysco management considers sysco brand penetration to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the gross profit performance of the company’s us broadline operations sysco offers an assortment of syscobranded products that can be differentiated from privately branded products which enables us to achieve higher gross margin by administering and leveraging a consolidated product procurement program for quality food and nonfood products due to cost efficiencies syscobranded products generate a higher gross margin than sales from other privately branded products we define sysco brand penetration as the percentage of syscobranded case volume sold to us broadline customers over all cases sold to us broadline customers this performance indicator also measured at the customer type level including local and national customers is driven by growth in the distribution of branded products to more customers and more geographies as well as increasing branded offerings through innovation and the launch of new products 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco management considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions however free cash flow may 

not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity see “liquidity and capital resources” for discussions of gaap metrics including net cash provided by operating activities and our reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure 

adjusted return on invested capital 

although adjusted return on invested capital roic is considered a nongaap financial measure sysco management considers adjusted roic to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the company’s longterm capital investments and has been a component of longterm incentive compensation we calculate adjusted roic as adjusted net earnings divided by 1 stockholders’ equity computed as the average of adjusted stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year and 2 longterm debt computed as the average of the longterm debt at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year trends in roic can fluctuate over time as management balances longterm strategic initiatives with possible shortterm impacts 

business update on the covid19 pandemic 

during the last couple of weeks of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 our business declined significantly from the time that shelter in place orders were issued in response to the covid19 pandemic we experienced declines in sales to the majority of our customers with the exception of certain customers in the healthcare segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 however we experienced sequential weekly improvements with the reopening of inrestaurant dining the “exit rate” of our sales as of the end of fiscal 2020 was a decline of approximately 30 compared to the end of fiscal 2019 in july 2020 as covid19 cases began increasing in certain locations the business recovery flattened however we have experienced weekly improvements in sales again in august 2020 

we have closely monitored developments in the covid19 pandemic as the situation has evolved and we are continuously revising our approach to create new processes and guidelines to keep associates and customers safe with careful consideration to remaining aligned with guidance from relevant health authorities 

• supporting employees – we have defined and implemented procedures to protect the health and safety of our employees while also ensuring business continuity and our ability to service our customers we have allowed employees to work remotely whenever possible and have installed protocols for daily temperature checks and health screenings for our employees not working remotely we have also provided guidelines for performing deep cleaning and proper social distancing in our offices and warehouses and have implemented requirements for employees to wear face coverings when not working remotely 

• serving customers – we have implemented procedures to limit the contact between our drivers and customers’ employees and have developed an alternative process to avoid collecting signatures for customer invoices and guidelines for safely accepting customer returns 

• assisting our communities – we have donated 30 million meals across eight countries since midmarch as part of our community response strategy to the pandemic these donations were valued at over 100 million and included nearly 16 million pounds of fresh produce and approximately six million pounds of fresh dairy products additionally we have supported over 900 community organizations in their efforts to address hunger and food insecurity by providing direct delivery to food banks and other hunger relief organizations by loaning refrigerated trucks and facility storage space to increase capacity for local food distribution and by providing volunteer and staffing support for mobile distribution efforts 

immediately after the onset of the crisis sysco took action to ensure liquidity reduce variable and structural costs and pivot our business to maximize sales during a period of disruption 

first we increased liquidity by i a 16 billion borrowing under our revolving credit facility ii a 4 billion unsecured bond offering iii establishment of a £600 million bank of england commercial paper program and iv a new 7500 million 364day credit facility as a result of these measures as of august 7 2020 the company had more than 80 billion in cash and available liquidity this liquidity provides us with financial flexibility during this difficult operating environment and enables us to invest in our business to transform the company during and after the crisis 

second we worked rapidly to stabilize the business by removing costs we have reduced our expenses to correspond to a lower level of sales volume and as a result we are taking appropriate steps to manage costs during the downturn we 

removed approximately 500 million of expenses from the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 which reflects in part the reduction to our staffing levels through temporary workforce furloughs and permanent reductions in force we began to realize the benefits of these changes beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the permanent changes are expected to deliver an annualized benefit of approximately 350 million 

third we created new sources of revenue including from our existing restaurant customers these include helping approximately 16000 of our customers to set up “popup shops” in their dining areas we have also helped customers with reopening plans such as patio and outdoor dining options and a shortened more focused menu as well as with the technological capability to start a website we have helped customers connect to preferred delivery partners and setup takeout menus and other support for their “to go” offerings the quick service restaurant segment continues to thrive in the current environment as the volume of “to go” and drivethrough orders has gained steady momentum 

lastly we have provided products for cleaning sanitation and personal protection without disruption so that our customers may continue business operations and have shifted sales to serve the retail grocery channel prior to the covid19 pandemic approximately 50 of food consumption within the us had been occurring away from home and the remainder had been taking place inside the home the covid19 pandemic has changed the balance and shifted more purchases to the retail grocery channel as a result we have pivoted our distribution model to include retail grocer and new supply chain partnerships sectors that we essentially did not serve prior to the covid19 crisis this has created longterm relationships with smaller regional retail grocers where we can add value through items such as quality proteins and fresh produce where our buying advantage is helpful for them in the longterm 

highlights and trends 

our fiscal 2020 results were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic we quickly responded by strengthening our balance sheet adding new and different types of customers and strategically committing resources to plan for the eventual return of demand 

below is a comparison of results from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 

• sales 

◦ decreased 120 or 72 billion to 529 billion 

• operating income 

◦ decreased 678 or 16 billion to 7495 million 

◦ adjusted operating income decreased 374 or 10 billion to 17 billion 

• net earnings

◦ decreased 869 or 278 to 042 from the comparable prior year amount of 320 per share and 

◦ adjusted diluted earnings per share were 201 in fiscal 2020 a 434 decrease from the comparable prior year amount of 355 per share 

trends 

economic and industry trends 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly negatively affected economic and industry trends primarily in the form of increased unemployment and significantly lower levels of activity in the foodawayfromhome market however in may and june 2020 we experienced steady and consistent weekoverweek sales improvement concurrently with reopenings of the economies of the countries and states in which we operate in july 2020 as covid19 cases began increasing in certain locations the business recovery flattened however we have experienced weekly improvements in sales again in august 2020 we believe consumers are experiencing fatigue with foodathome and are ready to reengage with restaurants however the speed and pace of the reengagement will be dictated by the restrictions that are placed on the industry as long as there are safe ways to access restaurantquality meals we believe that consumers are ready to eat away from home 

sales and gross profit trends 

our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price volume product mix and the impact of the covid19 pandemic the majority of our sales are to locally managed customers and national customers our locally managed customers including independent restaurant customers represent a greater percentage of our profitability as compared to national customers case growth with our locally managed broadline business is important to drive gross profit dollar growth our sales to national customers including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes gross margin on sales to our national customers is generally lower than on sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these customers in the us prior to the covid19 pandemic we had a greater customer mix with locally managed customers however during the crisis our national customers have experienced greater consumer demand which has changed our sales mix and resulted in lower gross margins we have also experienced customer closures that have impacted our customer mix however based on industry data sysco has experienced a lower rate of customer closings as compared to the foodservice industry as a whole sysco has the ability to shift focus across all segments throughout the foodservice industry whether local or national since the beginning of the pandemic we have added 10 billion of new national customer business on an annualized basis 

an additional impact of the covid19 pandemic has been the need to use price reductions to move inventory to avoid spoilage these price reductions were more prevalent in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and their use declined as the quarter progressed we expect gross margin to continue to reflect our sales mix changes but otherwise to remain stable in fiscal 2021 

additional items have impacted our sales and gross profit performance including the divestiture of iowa premium in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates a strengthening us dollar negatively affected total sysco sales growth by 03 for fiscal 2020 and negatively impacted sales growth for our international foodservice operations by 17 for fiscal 2020 as we translated our foreign sales due to foreign currency exchange rate changes partially offsetting these declines we experienced continued growth in penetration of our sysco brand portfolio and product price inflation our sysco branded product sales to us broadline local customers represented 468 of cases sold we experienced inflation at a rate of 18 during fiscal 2020 primarily in the beef and dairy products categories we anticipate sales in fiscal 2021 to be stronger than the exit rate of fiscal 2020 even with a choppy recovery 

operating expense trends 

total operating expenses increased 08 during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 the largest contributor to the increase was an additional charge for our allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of sysco’s customers including those in the restaurant hospitality and education segments are closed or operating at a substantially reduced volume due to governmental requirements for closures or other socialdistancing measures some of these customers have ceased paying their outstanding receivables creating uncertainty as to their collectability we have experienced an increase in past due receivables and have recognized additional bad debt charges in fiscal 2020 we recorded a provision for losses on receivables totaling 4042 million of which we believe approximately 3234 million is due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our customers calculated by comparing our june allowance results to average results prior to the covid19 pandemic with excess amounts being a reasonable estimate of what the reserve for the allowance for doubtful accounts would have been for fiscal 2020 absent the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

goodwill impairments 

during the second half of fiscal 2020 the company experienced significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and declines in equity valuations as well as regulatory restrictions implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company determined that certain reporting units were more sensitive than others to these declines and the company performed interim quantitative goodwill impairment tests for these reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models as part of the annual test in the fiscal fourth quarter the company performed further quantitative goodwill impairment tests updating the estimates and assumptions of longterm impact resulting from the pandemic that had been applied in the fiscal third quarter tests where necessary as a result in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company recorded impairments to goodwill for the pacific star and cake reporting units of 349 million and 342 million respectively which represented the full balance of goodwill for those reporting units during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the company recorded partial impairments to goodwill for the france group and fresh direct reporting units of 1087 million and 254 million respectively for total fiscal 2020 impairment charges of 2032 million 

costout measures 

the covid19 crisis has compelled us to take action to reduce costs by reducing variable expenses in response to reduced customer demand aligning inventory to current sales trends reducing capital expenditures to only urgent projects and 

tightly managing receivables these actions produced savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we have reduced payrelated expenses through temporary and permanent layoffs across the organization most of which occurred late in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 these actions resulted in an increase in severance charges in the second half of fiscal 2020 

we believe that the cost reductions implemented to date have removed approximately 350 million in structural annualized costs from the business 

status of supply chain disruptions and facility closures 

although our business continues to face challenges associated with decreased customer demand and increased costs directly related to the covid19 crisis to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our supply chain significant distribution facility closures or disposals of significant assets or lines of business during fiscal 2020 we assessed the value of assets held for sale primarily land and buildings and recognized a writedown charge of 559 million the majority of this charge related to our sharedservice center with plans established to sell this property and combine these operations into our corporate office the foodservice distribution industry is considered to be an essential industry and as such we expect our supply chain and facilities to remain in place and operational in the current environment and in the event of worsening macroeconomic conditions in connection with a prolonged downturn 

income tax trends 

our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions tax law changes increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate the impact of the covid19 pandemic may change our mix of earnings by jurisdiction and has increased the risk that operating losses may occur within certain of our jurisdictions that could lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if these losses are prolonged beyond our current expectations these effects would negatively impact our income tax expense net earnings and balance sheet 

our effective tax rate has been influenced by discrete events such as tax law changes and excess tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises as discussed in note 20 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in fiscal 2021 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24 

mergers and acquisitions 

we continue to be focused on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our strategy we completed the following acquisitions in fiscal 2020 within our us foodservice operations as follows 

• in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we acquired j kings food service professionals a new york broadline distributor with approximately 150 million in annual revenue 

• in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we acquired armstrong produce and kula produce a hawaiibased broadline fresh produce wholesaler and distributor with approximately 155 million in combined annual revenue 

strategy 

fiscal 2020 was the third year in our threeyear plan that was established in fiscal 2018 and included our strategic and financial objectives through fiscal 2020 during the second half of fiscal 2020 the company experienced a significant reduction in customer demand resulting from the continued spread of covid19 due to the rapidly evolving impact of the covid19 pandemic on our financial results and the uncertainty related to its duration we withdrew our guidance for the threeyear plan ending fiscal 2020 

in response to the current environment we have identified four key areas of focus as we manage the business in the nearterm and prepare the company for recovery once the covid19 crisis subsides first we have taken actions to strengthen our overall liquidity second we are focused on stabilizing the business by removing costs third we are creating new sources of revenue by helping our restaurant customers succeed under pandemic conditions fourth we are providing products for cleaning sanitation and personal protection without disruptions so that our customers may continue their business operations 

while our response to the covid19 pandemic has been a primary focus we have also accelerated our transformation initiatives that are intended to improve how we serve our customers differentiate sysco from our competitors and transform the industry first we have accelerated our work to become a more digitally enabled company we are investing to improve our 

digital order entry platform sysco shop we are also deploying a digital pricing tool that will help us increase sales expand margins and provide additional transparency to customers second we are transforming our sales model to make it easier for customers to do business with sysco and to increase the effectiveness of our sales teams we have aligned incentives of the sales force more closely with our business objectives and with our goal of increasing the partnership of sales teams across the multiple lines of business third we are regionalizing our operations in the us through regionalization we expect to be more efficient as a company and more agile with our decision making and we will be able to execute against strategies in a more efficient manner regionalization is a new leadership structure for our us broadline business as we will move from six markets comprised of 76 operating companies to four markets that consist of approximately 30 regions each made up of 2 to 3 operating sites we are not closing any physical distribution locations with this change and we are retaining our local drivers warehouse associates and sales force to support our customers fourth we are removing structural fixed costs from our business and becoming a more efficient company we have identified and implemented actions to remove approximately 350 million of annualized permanent costs from the business for fiscal 2021 we have identified additional cost opportunities that are expected to generate savings in fiscal 2022 and beyond these combined efforts are collectively referred to as our corporate modernization

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 



the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year 



1 other expense income net was expense of 479 million in fiscal 2020 and income of 361 million in fiscal 2019 

segment results 

the following represents our results by reportable segments 



nm represents that the percentage change is not meaningful 



based on information in note 22 “business segment information” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in fiscal 2020 us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 695 and 183 respectively of sysco’s overall sales compared to 687 and 191 respectively in fiscal 2019 in fiscal 2020 us foodservice operations represented approximately 1216 of the total segment operating income in fiscal 2019 us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 941 and 39 respectively of total segment operating income this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses along with sales operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources as operating income includes cost of goods sold as well as the costs to warehouse and deliver goods which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business 

results of us foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2020 the us foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 695 of sysco’s overall sales and 1216 of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s reporting segments several factors contributed to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 





sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the prior year in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



1 case volume excludes the volume impact from our customcut meat and seafood companies that do not measure volume in cases any impact in volumes from these operations are included within “other” 

2 approximately 439 million of this decrease for fiscal 2020 results from sysco’s sale of its interest in iowa premium in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 

sales were 109 lower in fiscal 2020 than in fiscal 2019 the largest driver of the decrease was the significant decline in case volume in our us broadline operations as the covid19 pandemic forced some of our customers to close and many others to operate at a substantially reduced volume case volumes for the company’s us broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months decreased 112 in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 and included a 96 decline in locally managed customer case growth along with a decrease of 130 in national customer case volume including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted locally managed customer sales by 10 therefore organic local case volume which excludes acquisitions decreased 106 

sales were 42 higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018 the largest drivers of the increase were case volume growth in our us broadline operations and the impact of product cost inflation case volumes for the company’s us broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months increased 27 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and included a 31 improvement in locally managed customer case growth along with an increase of 23 in national customer case volume including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted locally managed customer sales by 09 therefore organic local case volume which excludes acquisitions grew 22 

operating income 

operating income decreased by 330 in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019 as our decline in gross profits outpaced our reduction of operating expenses 

gross profit dollars decreased 121 in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 driven primarily by the decline in local cases partially offset by higher inflation and growth in syscobranded products the estimated change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation for fiscal 2020 for our us broadline operations was inflation of 18 for fiscal 2020 this change in product costs was primarily driven by inflation in the meat and dairy products categories our sysco brand sales to local customers decreased by approximately 24 basis points for fiscal 2020 gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of sales was 1973 in fiscal 2020 representing a decrease of 25 basis points from the gross margin of 1998 in fiscal 2019 primarily attributable to a temporary shift in customer mix as a result of the current operating environment and pricing reductions to help move inventory and avoid spoilage 

operating expenses for fiscal 2020 decreased 01 or 57 million compared to fiscal 2019 our decline in operating expenses during fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by permanent cost reductions and productivity measures largely offset by an increase in bad debt expense attributable to the covid19 pandemic’s impact on our customers’ ability to pay their outstanding receivables these operations also experienced reduced incentive compensation expense as the company’s financial performance with regard to the performance metrics under the fiscal 2020 management incentive plans was below target operating expenses on an adjusted basis which is a nongaap financial measure for which a reconciliation is provided above for fiscal 2020 decreased 47 or 2465 million compared to fiscal 2019 

operating income increased by 46 in fiscal 2019 over fiscal 2018 as our gross profits grew on pace with operating expenses 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 driven primarily by growth in sales of syscobranded products yearoveryear favorability of inbound freight and continued category management work our case growth for syscobranded sales to local customers increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019 additionally our customer mix has continued to improve as we grew local cases at a faster pace than total cases the change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation was estimated as inflation of 15 during fiscal 2019 for our us broadline operations inflation in fiscal 2019 occurred primarily in the frozen category principally for frozen potatoes and the canned and dry paper and disposables and produce categories 

operating expenses increased in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased costs in both transportation and warehouse resulting from the tight labor market combined with seasonal hiring of driver and warehouse staff which drove increased operational costs on a per unit basis as volume softened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 an increase in our provisions for losses on receivables has also contributed to the increase in operating expenses primarily due to stronger performance in collections and recoveries of previously written off receivables in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2019 

results of international foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2020 the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 183 of sysco’s overall sales 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 



sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



1 the impact of volumes as a component of sales growth from international operations are included within “other” volume in our foreign operations includes volume metrics that differ from country to country and cannot be aggregated on a consistent comparable basis 

sales for fiscal 2020 were 158 lower as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the significant decline in volumes in our europe and canada operations as the covid19 pandemic forced some of our customers to close and many others to operate at a substantially reduced volume our business in europe has decreased significantly as governments have issued “stayathome” orders that have resulted in a decline in restaurant traffic restaurant sales in canada have decreased as consumers are practicing isolation measures to protect health and safety for our latin american businesses the impact of covid19 has been most prominent in mexico where sales decreased more rapidly in costa rica our cash and carry stores are helping to offset the decrease in sales from restaurants 

operating income 

operating income decreased by 4969 million for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to the decline in business resulting from the reductions in our customers’ business attributable to the covid19 pandemic and from our ongoing restructuring and integration work in our european operations and facility consolidations in our canadian operations our business in france continued to experience operational challenges arising from our integration efforts restructuring and business transformation charges also negatively affected our uk operations as we continue our efforts related to modernizing the business and growing our customer base operating income on an adjusted basis decreased by 2468 million or 696 for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 foreign exchange rates negatively affected operating income by 07 therefore adjusted operating income decreased by 703 on a constant currency basis 

gross profit dollars decreased by 183 in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily attributable to decreased sales changes in foreign exchange rates that negatively affected gross profit by 18 resulting in a 165 increase in adjusted gross profit on a constant currency basis 

operating expenses for fiscal 2020 increased 26 or 599 million as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to increased restructuring and integration charges being incurred in france we incurred restructuring charges of 1919 million primarily relating to restructuring and integration in france and the uk and the largely completed facility consolidation in our canadian operations during fiscal 2020 as compared to 1529 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2019 additionally we incurred 883 million of excess bad debt expense related to the covid19 pandemic operating expenses on an adjusted basis for fiscal 2020 decreased 93 or 1902 million compared to fiscal 2019 changes in foreign exchange rates used to translate our foreign operating expenses into us dollars positively affected operating expenses during the period by 22 resulting in a 71 decrease in adjusted operating expenses on a constant currency basis 

results of sygma and other segment 

for sygma sales were 110 lower in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily from a decline in case volume due to the decrease in customer demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic although the quickservice and drivethru restaurants served by sygma continue to experience less of a downturn compared to other restaurant types operating income increased by 91 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to our focus on expense reductions through business and routing optimization this performance reflects sygma’s ability to gain new customers and operate efficiently throughout the crisis 

for the operations that are grouped within other operating income decreased 572 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 guest supply gross profit decreased 209 in fiscal 2020 as the business faced challenges resulting from the significant impact of the covid19 pandemic on the hotel industry 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses in fiscal 2020 increased 470 million or 55 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to costs associated with the business impact of the covid19 crisis including severance charges related to permanent workforce reductions and goodwill impairment charges charges for professional fees and other business transformation initiatives increased liability claims and expenses associated with our recent leadership change also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by reduced incentive compensation expense as the company’s financial performance with regard to the performance metrics under the fiscal 2020 management incentive plans was below target corporate expenses on an adjusted basis decreased 22 million or 03 as compared to fiscal 2019 

included in corporate expenses are certain items that totaled 2203 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to 1711 million in fiscal 2019 certain items impacting fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were primarily expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives severance charges arising from the covid19 pandemic and goodwill impairment charges 

corporate expenses in fiscal 2019 increased 632 million or 81 as compared to fiscal 2018 due primarily to an increase in expenses related to our business technology initiatives including accelerated depreciation on certain enterprise resource planning erp systems and software platforms that we are no longer using along with higher payrelated expenses partly driven by higher severance and relocation charges corporate expenses on an adjusted basis decreased 169 million or 25 as compared to fiscal 2018 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 478 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily attributable to higher fixed debt volume partially offset by lower floating interest rates 

net earnings 

net earnings declined 871 in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year due primarily to the items noted above for operating income and interest expense as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 16 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 adjusted net earnings excluding certain items decreased 444 in fiscal 2020 primarily due to a significant decrease in sales volume partially offset by a favorable tax expense comparison to the prior year 

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2020 were 042 an 870 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 324 per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 were 042 an 869 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 320 per share adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding certain items in fiscal 2020 were 201 a 434 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 355 per share these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings in fiscal 2020 

nongaap reconciliations 











set forth below is a reconciliation by segment of actual operating expenses and operating income to adjusted results for these measures for the periods presented dollars in thousands 











liquidity and capital resources 

highlights 

below are comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2019 

• cash flows from operations were 16 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 24 billion in fiscal 2019 

• net capital expenditures totaled 6917 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 6715 million in fiscal 2019 

• free cash flow was 9270 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 17 billion in fiscal 2019 see “nongaap reconciliation” below under the heading “free cash flow” for an explanation of this nongaap financial measure 

• cash used for acquisition of businesses was 1428 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 1066 million in fiscal 2019 

• cash proceeds from the sale of a business were 1499 million in fiscal 2019 

• there were 6167 million of commercial paper issuances and net bank borrowings in fiscal 2020 compared to 1321 million of commercial paper issuances and net bank borrowings in fiscal 2019 

• dividends paid were 8563 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 7754 million in fiscal 2019 and 

• cash paid for treasury stock repurchases was 8447 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 10 billion in fiscal 2019 

in addition we issued an aggregate of 50 billion in new senior notes in fiscal 2020 

in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its impact on our working capital as well as the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate cash flow in the near term we borrowed a total of 18 billion under our longterm revolving credit facility in the second half of fiscal 2020 as of june 27 2020 there were 7000 million in borrowings outstanding under this facility in fiscal 2020 sysco entered into a new unrelated commercial paper program in the uk allowing the company to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed £6000 million as of june 27 2020 there were £6000 million in borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program sysco also established a 364day credit facility in the amount of 7500 million scheduled to expire on may 19 2021 as of june 27 2020 there were no borrowings under this credit facility during fiscal 2020 aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances borrowings under our longterm revolving credit facility and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately 184 million to approximately 19 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 sysco suspended its treasury stock repurchases and reduced capital spending in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we entered into an amendment to our longterm revolving credit facility as described below under “debt activity and borrowing availability” which provides for new debt covenants and requires us to suspend share repurchases and dividend increases until the earlier of september 2022 or the date on which sysco has achieved a certain ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as of august 7 2020 the company has approximately 80 billion in cash and available liquidity 

sources and uses of cash 

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

• working capital requirements 

• investments in facilities systems fleet other equipment and technology 

• cash dividends 

• acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy 

• debt repayments and 

• share repurchases which are currently suspended pursuant to the amendment of our longterm revolving credit facility 

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we continue to be in a strong financial position based on our balance sheet and our operating cash flows however our liquidity and capital resources have been significantly and negatively impacted by the reduction in sales volume resulting from the covid19 pandemic our working capital needs have been reduced and continue to decline due to decreased demand and we are actively working with customers to receive payments on receivables optimizing our inventory levels and maximizing our payment terms with vendors we believe these actions will help to partially offset the unfavorable impact of the covid19 pandemic on our cash flows from operations 

we extend credit terms to our customers that can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness in the ordinary course of business customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable the company may utilize purchase arrangements with thirdparty financial institutions to transfer portions of our trade accounts receivable balance on a nonrecourse basis in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow the arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales see note 1 “summary of accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

as of june 27 2020 we had 61 billion in cash and cash equivalents approximately 14 of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to withholding and additional foreign tax obligations additionally sysco corporation has provided intercompany loans to certain of its international subsidiaries and when interest and principal payments are made some of this cash will move to the us 

our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive must maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund future reserve payments as of june 27 2020 the captive held 1163 million of fixed income marketable securities and 361 million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in a restricted investment portfolio in order to meet solvency requirements we purchased 114 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2020 and received 205 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities in that period 

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

• our cash flows from operations 

• the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs supported by our revolving credit facility and bank line of credit and 

• our ability to access capital from financial markets including issuances of debt securities either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec 

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary 

cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated 16 billion and 24 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively fiscal 2020 reflects lower operating results as well as yearoveryear unfavorable comparisons accrued on expenses and accrued income taxes partially offset by favorable comparisons on working capital 

the negative comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to an unfavorable comparison of customer rebate payments resulting from the decline in volume purchase incentives earned by our customers an unfavorable comparison of incentive payments resulting from prior year incentive payments exceeding current year accruals and an increase in payments associated with business technology projects 

the negative comparison yearoveryear with regard to our accrued income taxes is principally due to a decline in our tax liabilities resulting from our lower earnings in the second half of fiscal 2020 attributable to the covid19 pandemic 

changes in working capital had a positive impact of 2679 million on cash flows from operations periodoverperiod there was a favorable comparison on accounts receivable and inventories which was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison on accounts payable accounts receivable accounts payable and inventories have all decreased primarily due to 

significantly lower sales in fiscal 2020 resulting from the covid19 pandemic we are actively adjusting our replenishment of inventory to adapt to lower volumes while still maintaining appropriate levels of products that are critically needed in the current pandemic environment many of sysco’s customers including those in the restaurant hospitality and education segments are closed or operating at a substantially reduced volume due to governmental requirements for closures or other socialdistancing measures some of these customers have ceased paying their outstanding receivables creating uncertainty as to their collectability in fiscal 2020 we recorded a provision for losses on receivables totaling 4042 million of which we believe approximately 3234 million is due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our customers calculated by comparing our june allowance results to average results for periods ended prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic with excess amounts being a reasonable estimate of what the reserve for the allowance for doubtful accounts would have been for fiscal 2020 absent the impact of the covid19 pandemic we are working with our customers to collect past due balances including through the use of payment plans we have also discontinued charging interest on past due balances we believe that we will continue to experience risk in fiscal 2021 relating to uncollectible accounts however we expect to collect the unreserved balance of accounts receivable held prior to the onset of the covid19 crisis by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

we began to recognize the benefits provided in the provisions of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as we have deferred us social security tax to future fiscal years which has favorably impacted our cash flows from operations we are also implementing certain types of pay primarily with regard to our warehouse and delivery associates that under the provisions of the cares act will generate additional payroll tax credits over time 

we do not intend to seek and have not since the onset of the pandemic sought assistance from the us government however we are encouraging our customers to seek assistance where appropriate 

investing activities 

fiscal 2020 capital expenditures included 

• buildings and building improvements 

• fleet replacements 

• investments in technology and 

• warehouse equipment 

fiscal 2019 capital expenditures included 

• buildings and building improvements 

• investments in technology 

• fleet replacements and 

• warehouse equipment 

the level of gross capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 increased 280 million as compared to fiscal 2019 

in order to preserve our liquidity in response to the covid19 crisis we have reduced our expected capital expenditures by eliminating capital projects that are not urgently needed for our business and were not significantly underway 

during fiscal 2020 the company paid cash of 1428 million for acquisitions net of cash acquired including the acquisitions of j kings food service professionals armstrong produce and kula produce 

during fiscal 2019 the company paid cash of 1066 million for acquisitions net of cash acquired including waugh foods inc j  m wholesale meats and imperio foods inc within us foodservice operations classic drinks and the remaining interest in iowa premium making the previously consolidated entity a wholly owned subsidiary which was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 

during fiscal 2019 the company received 1499 million in proceeds from the sale of a business these dispositions resulted in a recognized gain of 663 million which is included within other income in the consolidated results of operations 

free cash flow 

our free cash flow for fiscal 2020 decreased by 8128 million to 9270 million as compared to fiscal 2019 principally as a result of a decrease in cash flows from operations and yearoveryear increased capital expenditures 

nongaap reconciliation 

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable gaap measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap see “key performance indicators” for further discussion regarding this nongaap financial measure in the table that follows free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 



financing activities 

equity transactions 

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 2276 million and 2531 million in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire 

we have routinely engaged in share repurchase programs to allow sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases in november 2017 our board of directors approved a repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company’s common stock not to exceed 15 billion through the end of fiscal 2020 in august 2019 our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company’s common stock not to exceed 25 billion through the end of fiscal 2021 we repurchased 111 million shares for 8447 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 150 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2019 for 10 billion during march 2020 we discontinued share repurchases under the program and pursuant to the amendment to our longterm revolving credit facility as described below under “debt activity and borrowing availability” we do not anticipate making any further repurchases through fiscal 2021 as of june 27 2020 we had a remaining authorization of approximately 21 billion 

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception dividends paid were 8563 million or 168 per share in fiscal 2020 and 7754 million or 150 per share in fiscal 2019 in may 2020 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of 045 per share which was paid in july 2020 although we expect to continue making quarterly dividend payments we do not expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2021 

in august 2018 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer had the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 7 2020 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

debt activity and borrowing availability 

our debt activity including issuances and repayments and our borrowing availability is described in note 13 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 our outstanding borrowings at june 27 2020 and repayment activity since the end of fiscal 2020 are disclosed within those notes updated amounts at august 7 2020 include 

• 7000 million outstanding from the credit facility supporting our us commercial paper program 

• no outstanding borrowings under our us commercial paper program and 

• £6000 million outstanding from our us and uk commercial paper programs 

our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 199 for fiscal 2020 and 247 for fiscal 2019 

in the next 12 months 750 million of longterm debt will mature we expect to repay these senior notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and to fund these repayments with a combination of cash flows from operations and the proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and longterm debt 

the availability of financing in the form of debt is influenced by many factors including our profitability free cash flows debt levels credit ratings debt covenants and economic and market conditions for example a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets as of august 7 2020 the company had approximately 80 billion in cash and available liquidity and we believe this amount would be sufficient to sustain our operations for an extended period including through an impact much worse than we are currently experiencing or expecting 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 sysco entered into an amendment to its 2 billion longterm revolving credit facility that expires on june 28 2024 the amendment revises the existing credit agreement to 1 adjust the covenant requiring sysco to maintain a certain ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense 2 include a covenant requiring sysco to maintain a certain level of liquidity until the earlier of september 2022 or the date on which sysco has achieved a certain ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 3 include additional pricing levels and a 075 interest rate floor and 4 include a new covenant that restricts a increases to sysco’s regular quarterly dividend and b repurchases of equity interests of sysco in each case until the earlier of september 2022 or the date on which sysco has achieved a certain ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as of june 27 2020 sysco was in compliance with all of its debt covenants 

guarantor summarized financial information 

on january 19 2011 the wholly owned us broadline subsidiaries of sysco corporation which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products at that time entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of sysco corporation a list of the current guarantors is included in exhibit 22 to this form 10k all subsequent issuances of senior notes and debentures in the us and borrowings under the company’s 20 billion longterm revolving credit facility have also been guaranteed by these subsidiaries as discussed in note 13 “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 as of june 27 2020 sysco had a total of 132 billion in senior notes debentures and borrowings under the longterm revolving credit facility that were guaranteed by these subsidiary guarantors our remaining consolidated subsidiaries nonguarantor subsidiaries are not obligated under the senior notes indenture debentures indenture or our longterm revolving credit facility 

all subsidiary guarantors are 100 owned by the parent company all guarantees are full and unconditional and all guarantees are joint and several the guarantees rank equally and ratably in right of payment with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the respective guarantors 

the assets of sysco corporation consist principally of the stock of its subsidiaries therefore the rights of sysco corporation and the rights of its creditors to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation recapitalization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors except to the extent that claims of sysco corporation itself andor the claims of those creditors themselves may be recognized as creditor claims of the subsidiary furthermore the ability of sysco corporation to service its indebtedness and other obligations is dependent upon the earnings and cash flow of its subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment to it of such earnings or cash flow if any of sysco corporation’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on its assets sysco corporation’s rights and the rights of its creditors including the rights of a holder of senior notes as an owner of debt securities will be 

subject to that prior claim unless sysco corporation or such noteholder if such noteholder’s debt securities are guaranteed by such subsidiary also is a direct creditor of that subsidiary 

the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor with respect to a series of senior notes or debentures may be released under certain customary circumstances if we exercise our defeasance option with respect to the senior notes or debentures of any series then any subsidiary guarantor effectively will be released with respect to that series further each subsidiary guarantee will remain in full force and effect until the earliest to occur of the date if any on which 1 the applicable subsidiary guarantor shall consolidate with or merge into sysco corporation or any successor of sysco corporation or 2 sysco corporation or any successor of sysco corporation consolidates with or merges into the applicable subsidiary guarantor 

basis of preparation of the summarized financial information 

the following tables include summarized financial information of sysco corporation issuer and certain wholly owned us broadline subsidiaries guarantors together the obligor group the summarized financial information of the obligor group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated investments in and equity in the earnings of our nonguarantor subsidiaries which are not members of the obligor group have been excluded from the summarized financial information 

the obligor group’s amounts due to amounts due from and transactions with nonguarantor subsidiaries have been presented in separate line items if they are material to the obligor financials 





offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of june 27 2020 certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 



1 the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan and management savings plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement ages and payout periods 

2 includes estimated contributions to the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2030 based on actuarial assumptions 

3 unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions as of june 27 2020 we had a liability of 231 million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and 41 million for related interest that could result in cash payment of which 72 million could settle in cash we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time accordingly the related balances have not been reflected in the “payments due by period” section of the table 

4 includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june 27 2020 assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates the impact of our outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june 27 2020 

5 for purposes of this table purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed including minimum quantities resulting from our category management process such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various thirdparty service providers to provide information technology services for periods up to fiscal 2026 see discussion under note 21 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only if certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 27 2020 were 260 million this amount is not included in the table above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the goodwill and intangible assets allowance for doubtful accounts income taxes sharebased compensation and companysponsored pension plans 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values we use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we generally use the income method which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill more information on our acquisitions can be found in note 5 “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

annually in our fiscal fourth quarter we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets impairment reviews outside our annual review time frame are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment however if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is performed 

when using a quantitative test we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit we use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 

certain reporting units have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

during the second half of fiscal 2020 the company experienced significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and declining equity valuations as well as regulatory restrictions implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company determined that certain reporting units were more sensitive than others to these declines and the company performed interim quantitative goodwill impairment tests for these reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models as part of the annual test in the fiscal fourth quarter the company performed further quantitative goodwill impairment tests updating the estimates and assumptions of longterm impact resulting from the pandemic that had been applied in the fiscal third quarter tests where necessary as a result in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company recorded impairments to goodwill for the pacific star and cake reporting units of 349 million and 342 million respectively which represented the full balance of goodwill for those reporting units during the fourth quarter the company recorded partial impairments to goodwill for the france group and fresh direct reporting units of 1087 million and 254 million respectively for total fiscal 2020 impairment charges of 2032 million 

in the annual fiscal 2020 assessment impairment charges would have been applicable for two reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by ranges of 17 to 29 with goodwill of 3695 million in the aggregate as of june 27 2020 recorded for these reporting units 

the company estimated the fair value of these reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models for the purposes of the discounted cash flow models fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate the fair value conclusions as of june 27 2020 for the reporting units are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the income approach which include forecasted revenues perpetual growth rates and longterm discount rates among others all of which require significant judgments by management fair value of the reporting unit is therefore determined using significant unobservable inputs or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy the company has used recent historical performance current forecasted financial information and broadbased industry and economic statistics as a basis to estimate the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model these key assumptions are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of estimation and judgment and are subject to change based on future changes industry and global economic and geopolitical conditions and the timing and success of the implementation of current strategic initiatives the impact of the covid19 pandemic on estimated future cash flows is uncertain and will largely depend on the outcome of future events which could result in further goodwill impairments going forward 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods in these instances a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries 

towards the end of march 2020 our business declined significantly from the time that the shelter in place orders were issued this resulted in many of our customers closing or operating at a substantially reduced volume for customers that have closed in many cases it is not clear which closures are temporary or permanent however we have experienced an increase in past due receivables and have recognized additional bad debt charges of 3234 million specific to the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2020 prior to the covid19 pandemic our allowance was primarily based on historical loss experience since the crisis began our writeoff percentages have been based not only on historical loss experience but also on our experience with losses incurred during times of local and regional disasters additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we included the company’s current collection experience which has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic we anticipate continuing this approach in fiscal 2021 while the covid19 pandemic is more widespread and longer in duration than historical disasters impacting our business it is possible that actual uncollectible amounts will differ and additional charges may be required in fiscal 2021 our balance for the allowance of doubtful accounts as of june 27 2020 is 3348 million our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions tax law changes increases or decreases in book versus tax basis differences accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate the impact of the covid19 pandemic may change our mix of earnings by jurisdiction and has increased the risk that operating losses may occur within certain of our jurisdictions that could lead to the recognition of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the future if these losses are prolonged beyond our current expectations this would negatively impact our income tax expense net earnings and balance sheet 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

sharebased compensation 

sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans a nonemployee director plan and the 2015 employee stock purchase plan espp 

as of june 27 2020 there was 793 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 19 years 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award and performance share unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units and performance share units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period expense recognized on performance share unit awards is subsequently adjusted based on forecasted performance compared to planned targets until the performance period concludes and the actual number of shares of sysco common stock to be received upon the vesting of the performance share units is known 

the fair value of the stock issued under the espp is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or nonemployee directors is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the espp is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

our sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our us retirement plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees our serp is frozen and is not open to any employees none of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates specific to our results of operations but such changes could impact our balance sheet due to a 

change in our funded status due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is not a critical assumption 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan is 500 for fiscal 2020 consistent with fiscal 2019 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan decreased by 25 basis points to 475 for fiscal 2021 due to expected lower longterm rate of return a 50 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return in the plan for fiscal 2021 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2021 by approximately 31 million 

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 27 2020 was a charge net of tax of 13 billion driven by declines in both discount rates and expected return on assets the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 29 2019 was a charge net of tax of 12 billion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risks consist of interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk fuel price risk and investment risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

at june 27 2020 there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding under our us commercial paper program and we had £6000 million outstanding under our uk commercial paper program total debt as of june 27 2020 was 144 billion of which approximately 79 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

at june 29 2019 there was 1321 million in commercial paper issuances outstanding total debt as of june 29 2019 was 78 billion of which approximately 70 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

details of our outstanding swap agreements as of june 27 2020 are below 



we receive or pay amounts on these interest rate swap agreements on a semiannual basis 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of june 27 2020 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents

rate a – threemonth libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our largest currency exposures are with canadian dollars british pound sterling and euro currencies our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively affected sales by 03 in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 the exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively affected sales by 08 in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019 a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2020 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively affected fiscal 2020 sales by 14 and would not have materially affected our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our investments and loans to our foreign operations created additional foreign currency exposure in fiscal 2017 we designated €500 million of euro notes issued in june 2016 as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in eurodenominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations changes in the value of these items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to us dollar exchange rates are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss we have also entered into various cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of exchange rate changes for intercompany loans that are not in the functional currency of our subsidiaries these have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes recorded within foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 05 of sales during fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges that primarily track with the change in market prices of fuel we use diesel fuel swap contracts to fix the price of a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 27 2020 we had diesel fuel swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 54 million gallons through december 2021 these swaps are expected to lock in the price of approximately 60 of our projected fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2021 our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 34 million in our fuel costs on our noncontracted volumes 

investment risk 

our us retirement plan holds various investments including public and private equity fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plans at the plans’ fiscal year end december 31 2019 would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2021 however such an unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2021 by 363 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 27 2020 by 4409 million

reporting segments 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise we have aggregated certain operating segments into three reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

 

broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in note 22  “business segment information” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

customers and products 

sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served services to our customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

the products we distribute include 

 we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

 

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 



 

our distribution centers which we refer to as operating companies distribute branded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training 

and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various thirdparty services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended june 29 2019  

we estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 



 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers we also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to midsized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products our locally sourced products including produce meats cheese and other products help differentiate our customers’ offerings satisfy demands for new products and support local communities purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs domestically and internationally and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources” regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

we extend credit terms to our customers that can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 45 days or more 

corporate headquarters and shared services center 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies and our shared services center performs support services for employees suppliers and customers members of these groups possess experience and expertise in among other areas customer and vendor contract administration accounting and finance treasury legal information technology payroll and employee benefits risk management and insurance sales and marketing merchandising inbound logistics human resources strategy and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available supply chain expertise such as in warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

during fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  6924 million  6878 million and 6864 million  respectively were invested in delivery fleet facilities technology and other capital asset enhancements from time to time we dispose of assets in the normal course of business we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures during fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets were 6715 million  6656 million and 6627 million  respectively capital expenditures as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 were 11  11 and 12  respectively we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2020 should be approximately 13 of sales during the three years ended june 29 2019  capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2020 capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

as of june 29 2019  we had approximately 69000 employees approximately 22 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 32 of our union employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal 2020  which contracts are subject to renegotiation since june 29 2019  there have been 13 contract renegotiations we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

competition 

a large number of companies are engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores online retailers or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors some organizations compete with us on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently product needs service requirements and price are just a few of the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly there are few barriers to market entry existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers 

we estimate that we serve about 16 of an approximately 300 billion annual foodservice market in the united states us based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2018  based on industry data obtained from technomic inc we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2019  while comprehensive industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our operations in the us and canada are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in those trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our marketing associates our diversified product base which includes qualityassured sysco brand products the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis and our multiregional presence in north america and europe which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time 

we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements there are a small number of companies competing in the foodawayfromhome industry in the us with publicly traded equity while our public company status provides us with some advantages over many of our competitors including access to capital we believe it also puts us at a disadvantage in that most of our competitors do not face the obligations and additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements applicable to public companies 

government regulation 

our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business

our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate including the sherman antitrust act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the us these laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices boycotting competitors or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition in many jurisdictions compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions 

outside the us our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations as well as other legal and regulatory requirements for example we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the european union the eu as well as those of eu countries where we conduct business including the uk ireland france and sweden which requirements relate to among other things competition product composition packaging labeling advertisement including nutrition and health claims and the safety of food products as well as the health safety and working conditions of employees we are subject to privacy laws in the eu including the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of personal data in addition our business is subject to the uk modern slavery act 2015 which requires certain companies that operate in the uk to prepare a report describing steps that they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their supply chain or business our business is also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 an anticorruption law that criminalizes the failure by a company to prevent persons associated with that company from offering or paying bribes to government officials or nongovernment persons in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company as well as restricting the offer payment or receipt of bribes to or from governmental officials and nongovernmental persons

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and from historical trends 

industry and general economic risks 

our industry is characterized by low margins and periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of significant product cost inflation may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers in a timely manner in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may adversely affect our business due to the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive environment conversely our business may be adversely affected by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our results of operations may be adversely affected during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in north america and europe as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the foodservice industry is characterized by relatively low profit margins with modest demand growth expected in the nearterm and consequently our results of operations are susceptible to regional national and international economic trends and uncertainties economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

 

historically north america and europe have experienced from time to time deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in their financial markets which have adversely impacted business and consumer confidence and spending and depressed capital investment and economic activity in the affected regions if similar unfavorable economic conditions were to arise in the future or recent volatility in the financial markets and the global economy were to continue our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations subject us to certain risks including economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations in international markets in which we operate for example the uk’s anticipated exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and the resulting significant change to the uk’s relationship with the eu and with countries outside the eu and the laws regulations and trade deals impacting business conducted between them could disrupt the overall economic growth or stability of the uk and the eu and otherwise negatively impact our european operations 

the uk is currently negotiating the terms of brexit with the uk currently due to exit the eu on or before october 31 2019 in november 2018 the uk and the eu agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement that set out the terms governing the uk’s departure including among other things a transition period to allow for a future trade deal to be agreed upon after the uk parliament rejected the draft withdrawal agreement multiple times during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the eu agreed to an extension of the exit date to october 31 2019 as a result there is significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the uk will leave the eu it is possible that brexit will result in our uk and eu operations becoming subject to materially different and potentially conflicting laws regulations or tariffs which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices furthermore if the uk were to leave the eu without an agreement a “hard brexit” there may be additional adverse impacts on immigration and trade between the uk and the eu or countries outside the eu such impacts may directly increase our costs or could decrease demand for our goods and services by adversely impacting the business of restaurants or other customers in the foodservice distribution industry 

the completion of brexit could also adversely affect the value of our euro and pounddenominated assets and obligations exchange rates related to the british pound sterling have been more volatile since the uk announced it would exit the eu and such volatility may continue in the future future fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the local currencies of our suppliers may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the uk which increases we may not be able to pass on to our customers uncertainty surrounding brexit has contributed to recent fluctuations in the uk economy which contracted in the second quarter of 2019 and could experience future disruptions in addition brexit could cause financial and capital markets within and outside the uk or the eu to constrict thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business and could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry any one of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

additionally the “yellow vest” protests in france against a fuel tax increase and the french government have negatively impacted our sales in france and may continue to do so similarly future labor disruptions or disputes could disrupt the integration of brake france and davigel into sysco france and our operations in france and the eu generally in addition if changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods services and workers in either the uk or france or in other parts of the eu with respect to brexit or otherwise our european operations could also be negatively impacted 

competition and the impact of gpos may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional and multiregional distributors and specialty competitors local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach private label offerings overall purchasing power cost efficiencies and ability to meet customer distribution requirements these suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures online direct food wholesalers and cash and carry operations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

moreover some of our customers purchase their products from us through group purchasing organizations or “gpos” in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders gpos have a relatively larger presence in the healthcare lodging and foodservice management customer segments if these gpos are able to add a significant number of our customers as members it may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting or other concessions such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices which could also adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past through among other things our fuel surcharge program there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future if fuel costs increase in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements including fuel derivatives to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices nevertheless our fuel hedging transactions may not be effective in protecting us from changes in fuel prices and if fuel prices were to decrease significantly these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higherthanmarket costs for a portion of our diesel fuel in addition our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that any of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations whether due to its insolvency or otherwise which could result in financial losses 

business and operational risks 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not be able to provide the foodservice products and supplies that we need in the quantities and at the prices that we request we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include shortages of qualified labor for our suppliers work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages animal disease outbreaks transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands terrorist attacks or international hostilities and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect demand for our products at any time input costs could increase for a prolonged period for a large portion of the products that we sell additionally we procure products from suppliers outside of the us and we are subject to the risks associated with political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade any or all of which could delay our receipt of products or increase our input costs our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

in addition as a foodservice distributor it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase a product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory adversely affecting our results of operations 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business sysco’s brand names trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products whether or not justified including negative publicity about the quality safety sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to illegal or unethical activities by our employees suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis salmonella listeria or swine flu or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or reduce public confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers were to become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations which would have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the 

use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and materially adversely affect our results of operations 

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence in us and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time market competition customer requirements customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships we may not be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts that insolvent customers might owe us our customer agreements are generally terminable upon written notice by either us or the customer which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes to the mix of locally managed customers versus multiunit customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing the volume of our sales to locally managed customers is very important for our business and our results of operations gross margin from our multiunit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locally managed customers if sales to our locally managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multiunit customers our operating margins may decline 

moreover if sales to our multiunit customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally managed customers we will become more dependent on multiunit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales additionally the loss of sales to the larger of these multiunit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers we could be pressured by them to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases our results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in consumer eating habits such as a decline in consuming food away from home a decline in portion sizes or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers could reduce demand for our products consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods there is a growing consumer preference for sustainable organic and locally grown products and a shift towards plantbased proteins andor animal proteins derived from animals that were humanely treated and antibiotic free 

changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts millennials the largest demographic group in terms of spend seek new and different as well as more ethnic menu options and menu innovation if consumer eating habits change significantly we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio and we may experience higher costs andor supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to the new eating preferences changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home additionally changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose 

the nutritional content of our food products compliance with these laws and regulations as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products may be costly and timeconsuming we may not be able to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits 

we may not be able to achieve our threeyear financial targets by the end of fiscal year 2020 

in fiscal 2018 we set new threeyear financial targets to grow operating income accelerate earnings per share growth faster than operating income growth and improve return on invested capital our ability to meet these financial targets depends largely on our successful execution of our business plan including various related initiatives there are various risks related to these efforts including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame if at all and may prove costlier than expected and the risk of adverse effects to our business results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings and the associated changes to our business do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate our intentions and expectations with regard to the execution of our business plan and the timing of any related initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs in early fiscal 2020 we lowered our fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020 adjusted operating income growth target to approximately 600 million see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  strategy and fiscal 2020 threeyear financial targets” if we are unable to successfully execute our business plan whether due to our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our various business initiatives in the anticipated time frame or otherwise we may be unable to achieve our threeyear financial targets 

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful  

an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example the us and many countries in the eu where we do business are actively considering or have recently enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified we are also subject to nonincomebased taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions although we believe that our income and nonincomebased tax estimates are appropriate there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

given the unpredictability of possible further changes to the us or foreign tax laws and regulations and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on our results of operations and cash flow but such laws and regulations and changes thereto could adversely impact our financial results 

if the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims 

we like any other foodservice distributor may be subject to product recalls including voluntary recalls or withdrawals if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness to have been mislabeled misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations we may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards whether for taste appearance or otherwise in order to protect our brand and reputation any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures destruction of product inventory damage to our reputation andor lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco is alleged to have caused injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image umbrella liability insurance that we maintain for product liability claims may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business  

we are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many aspects of our business such as food safety and sanitation ethical business practices transportation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs for a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject please refer to “business  government regulation” in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we may not be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times moreover we may not be able to comply with all future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance 

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 



in the course of our operations we operate maintain and fuel fleet vehicles store fuel in onsite above and underground storage tanks operate refrigeration systems and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes we could incur substantial costs including fines or penalties and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment in addition we could incur investigation remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties 

for example most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks certain of these laws and regulations in the eu may impose liability for costs of investigation or remediation of contamination which could be material regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal and even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of our operations at the site and was not caused by our activities in addition many of our facilities have propane and batterypowered forklifts proposed or recently enacted legal requirements such as those requiring the phaseout of certain ozonedepleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may require us to upgrade or replace equipment or may increase our transportation or other operating costs 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected for example we encountered operational challenges in fiscal 2019 in connection with our efforts to integrate two businesses in france acquired in connection with the brakes group acquisition which integration efforts have adversely affected our ability to drive growth in sales integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s 

a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments in addition our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with respect to a significant acquired business could result in material weaknesses andor a failure to file our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission on a timely basis 

we need access to borrowed funds to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

as described in note 13  “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 as of june 29 2019  we had approximately 82 billion of total indebtedness this amount included senior notes and issuances under a commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 20 billion  we also have a revolving credit facility supporting our us commercial paper program in the amount of 20 billion scheduled to expire on june 28 2024  and various other smaller bank facilities 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for us including 

 

our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures potential acquisitions joint ventures andor share repurchase programs our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of future debt financing and financial results and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

changes in the method of determining london interbank offered rate libor or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt 

amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility may bear interest rates in relation to libor depending on our selection of repayment options in addition certain of our outstanding interest rate swap agreements have a floating interest rate in relation to threemonth libor on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of 2021 it is unclear whether new methods of calculating libor will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 the us federal reserve is considering replacing us dollar libor with a newly created index called the broad treasury financing rate calculated with a broad set of shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities if libor ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate the credit facility and any interest rate swap agreements expiring after 2021 and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us the overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of libor disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the credit facility or our interest rate swap agreements with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and operating results 

we rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis we also use mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and customers further our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners 

these technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters power outages systems failures security breaches espionage cyberattacks viruses theft and inadvertent release of information any such disruption to these software and other technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated or the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies and competitive disadvantage any or all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits moreover a significant cybersecurity breach could require us to devote significant additional management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect personal information against cyberattacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information which could result in a disruption of our operations 

further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks 

while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents as well as disaster recovery plans these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations additionally information technology systems continue to evolve and in order to remain competitive we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner if our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do such competitors may 

be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we do business for example the eu adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data we are working to comply with gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area that apply to us and we anticipate needing to devote significant additional resources to complying with these laws and regulations our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area could result in substantial fines or penalties and legal liability and could tarnish our reputation 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 12 of our current us employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2019  our total contributions to these plans were approximately 485 million  the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan we could also be treated as partially withdrawing from participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain percentage over a certain period of time such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations such as facility closures or consolidations based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 128 million as of june 29 2019  a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

at the end of fiscal 2012  we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan us retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013  these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 45 billion as of june 29 2019  therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements see note 15  “companysponsored employee benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the us retirement plan 

the amount of our annual contribution to the us retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the us retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability in fiscal 2018 we made voluntary contributions of 380 million to the us retirement plan allowing us to set an investment strategy that more closely aligns the duration of the us retirement plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities as a result our us retirement plan holds a greater amount of investments in fixed income securities but also holds equity securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the us retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse effect on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience significant future declines andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

as of june 29 2019  we had approximately 69000 employees approximately 22 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each 

individual operating company approximately 32 of our union employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal 2020  which contracts are subject to renegotiation failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability and the ability of third parties on which we rely to supply and to deliver our products to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly adversely affect our business employee recruitment development and retention efforts undertaken by us andor such thirdparties may not be successful resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods any such shortage could decrease our ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties and a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and are impacted by restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives 2 severance and facility closure charges and 3 restructuring charges our results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 are also impacted by the following acquisitionrelated items 1 intangible amortization expense and 2 integration costs fiscal 2019 results of operations were impacted by a gain on the sale of iowa premium llc iowa premium in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 in addition fiscal 2018 results of operations were impacted 

by multiemployer pension plan mepp withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges sysco’s results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were also impacted by the changes to the united states us tax code resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tax act enacted on december 22 2017 the impact for fiscal 2019 and 2018 includes a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and the impact for fiscal 2019 also includes the recognition of a foreign tax credit applicable to repatriated earnings additionally the impact for fiscal 2018 includes 1 a net benefit from remeasuring sysco’s accrued income taxes deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates and 2 a benefit from contributions made to fund the us retirement plan pension plan all acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2019 and 2018 that have been designated as certain items relate to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of cucina lux investments limited the brakes acquisition 

the fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 items described above and excluded from our nongaap measures are collectively referred to as “certain items” management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations 2 facilitates comparisons on a yearoveryear basis and 3 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that as a result are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity 

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the table below each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above in the table below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding 

any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of certain items more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

the following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 has been omitted from this form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 24 2018 

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe the company has aggregated certain operating segments into three reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

 

we estimate that we serve about 16 of an approximately 300 billion annual foodservice market in the us based on industry data obtained from technomic inc from time to time technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and as a result our percentage can change not only from our sales results but also from such revisions we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share 

according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 52 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar year 2018  industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the us experienced a real sales increase of approximately 12 in calendar year 2018 and 14 in calendar year 2017  real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

highlights and trends 

our fiscal year 2019 financial performance improved yearoveryear we continue to focus on our customers and furthering the progress of our transformative initiatives that we believe will position us well for longterm growth and create value for our shareholders in fiscal 2020 and beyond 

below is a comparison of results from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018  

 

the overall macroeconomic trends continue to be positive in the us and the underlying economic picture remains relatively positive including growth in gross domestic product of 21 for the second quarter of calendar year 2019 and continued low unemployment which was 37 in july consumer confidence has decreased slightly but remains solid these factors are important macroeconomic indicators that describe the environment in which our customers are currently operating and speak to the relative health of the foodawayfromhome market restaurant industry trends reflect same store sales that were relatively flat in june while customer traffic continues to be negative the economic outlook in the international geographies in which we operate is mostly positive however the uk is experiencing low consumer confidence due to the uncertain outcome of brexit 

our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price volume and product mix the modest level of growth in the foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures which can adversely affect our profitability the majority of our sales are to locally managed customers and national customers our locally managed customers including independent restaurant customers represent a greater percentage of our profitability as compared to national customers case growth with our locally managed broadline business is important to drive gross profit dollar growth we are maintaining our focus on growing our digital platform to continue the growth with our local customers our sales to national customers including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes gross margin on sales to our national customers is generally lower than on sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these customers we are taking a disciplined approach to increasing our sales with national customers to profitably grow our business 

we offer an assortment of syscobranded products that we can differentiate from privately branded products which enables us to achieve higher gross profits as a result we focus on sales growth for these products comprising 47 of us broadline sales to locally managed customers in fiscal 2019 using customer insights industry trends and innovative ideas we launched new brands during fiscal 2019 we are introducing our brand to additional geographies outside the us we have experienced continued success in category management and we are introducing this process in our european operations 

a portion of the cost to obtain products includes inbound freight these costs have stabilized in fiscal 2019  but are still above prefiscal 2018 levels inflation is a factor that contributes to the level of sales and gross profit growth and can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure we experienced a modest level of inflation in fiscal 2019  with our us broadline operations experiencing a rate of inflation of 15 primarily in the frozen category principally for frozen potatoes and the canned and dry paper and disposables and produce categories inflation has been higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  as compared to the beginning of the fiscal year inflation for our us broadline operations was 25 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  

principally in the poultry meat and produce categories periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have an unfavorable effect on us and our customers as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers 

changes in exchange rates can impact our foreign sales as we convert them to us dollars in fiscal 2019  foreign exchange rates reduced our total sales by 08  

we experienced higher operating expenses in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  due to investments we made in our business particularly in our international segment such as our integration of brake france and davigel into sysco france from increased investments in technology for our business transformation initiatives and from increased supply chain costs in both transportation and warehouse primarily in our us operations strength in the labor markets is a positive factor contributing to sales growth in the us and canada however the tightening labor market in these geographies has an adverse effect on our operating expenses including increased overtime expense and higher costs associated with hiring we are addressing these challenges by continuing to drive productivity and focusing on retention initiatives for specialized recruiting training and onboarding efforts to better retain talent in our supply chain operations and we are experiencing positive results from these efforts these expense increases were partially offset by benefits from our transformative initiatives and corporate expense management 

we have multiple transformational and operational initiatives underway which include among others 

 

we believe these initiatives will drive growth and profitability in the longterm 

our effective tax rate has been influenced by discrete events such as tax law changes and excess tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises as discussed in note 20  “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in fiscal 2020 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24 

we continue to be focused on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our strategy we have completed several acquisitions in fiscal 2019 within our us foodservice operations and our international foodservice operations as follows 

us foodservice operations 

 

in addition to the acquisitions noted above in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we purchased the remaining interests in iowa premium making the previously consolidated entity a wholly owned subsidiary sysco initially acquired an interest in the specialty meat company in fiscal 2014 we subsequently sold iowa premium in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and realized a gain of 663 million  

international foodservice operations 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we acquired j kings food service professionals a new york broadline distributor with approximately 150 million in annual sales 

strategy and fiscal 2020 threeyear financial targets 

our objective to improve the overall customer experience is a core element of our success over the past few years and will continue to be a key focus as we move forward we have identified four strategic priorities that will accelerate our current growth and guide us into the future these priorities are to enrich the customer experience deliver operational excellence optimize our business and activate the power of our people 

fiscal 2019 is the second year in our current threeyear plan that was established in fiscal 2018 and includes our strategic and financial objectives through fiscal 2020 which will enable us to continue transforming our business while improving the customer experience of doing business with sysco our target financial objectives set at the beginning of our current threeyear plan cycle included 

 

while we continue to experience improved operating performance yearoveryear our volume growth is lower than originally anticipated and we have incurred increased expenses due to these items combined with the impact of our sale of iowa premium we are lowering our fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2020 adjusted operating income growth target to approximately 600 million 

in accomplishing these goals we believe that by fiscal 2020 we could also achieve as compared to fiscal 2017 1 case growth of 25 to 30 of which local case growth would contribute 30 to 33 2 sales and gross profit growth of 35 to 40 3 adjusted operating income growth of 8 and 4 adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of approximately 15 the objectives targeted in our threeyear plan included the impact of the tax act the key levers to achieve these targets include an emphasis on accelerating locally managed customer case growth and driving leverage between gross profit growth and expense growth 

our operating income goal was established on an adjusted basis given certain item charges that were applicable in fiscal 2017 which primarily were due to restructuring and brakesrelated acquisitions costs the business transformation initiatives we have in place will allow us to continue to grow our business and capitalize on our strong fundamentals we are placing further emphasis on assessing our work in order to effectively centralize and standardize our business including leveraging technology and strengthening sysco overall we will continue to focus on strong implementation and execution while accelerating some of this work all of which better position us to achieve our financial objectives 

see “nongaap reconciliations” for an explanation of these nongaap financial measures

segment results 

the following represents our results by reportable segments 





based on information in note 22  “business segment information” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in fiscal 2019  us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 687 and 191  respectively of sysco’s overall sales compared to 675 and 196  respectively in fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2019  us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 944 and 37  respectively of 

the total segment operating income compared to 922 and 58  respectively in fiscal 2018  this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses along with sales operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources as operating income includes cost of goods sold as well as the costs to warehouse and deliver goods which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business 

results of us foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2019  the us foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 687 of sysco’s overall sales and 944 of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s reporting segments several factors contributed to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 



sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the prior year in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



 

sales were 42 higher in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018  the largest drivers of the increase were case volume growth in our us broadline operations and the impact of product cost inflation case volumes for the company’s us broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months increased 27 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and included a 31 

improvement in locally managed customer case growth along with an increase of 23 in national customer case volume including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted locally managed customer sales by 09  therefore organic local case volume which excludes acquisitions grew 22  

operating income 

operating income increased by 44 in fiscal 2019 over fiscal 2018  as our gross profits grew on pace with operating expenses 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  driven primarily by growth in sales of syscobranded products yearoveryear favorability of inbound freight and continued category management work our case growth for syscobranded sales to local customers increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2019  additionally our customer mix has continued to improve as we grew local cases at a faster pace than total cases the change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation was estimated as inflation of 15 during fiscal 2019 for our us broadline operations inflation in fiscal 2019 occurred primarily in the frozen category principally for frozen potatoes and the canned and dry paper and disposables and produce categories 

operating expenses increased in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to increased costs in both transportation and warehouse resulting from the tight labor market combined with seasonal hiring of driver and warehouse staff which drove increased operational costs on a per unit basis as volume softened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 an increase in our provisions for losses on receivables has also contributed to the increase in operating expenses primarily due to stronger performance in collections and recoveries of previously written off receivables in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2019 

results of international foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2019  the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 191 of sysco’s overall sales and 37 of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 



sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



 

sales were 02 lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018  the decrease for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars additionally we encountered operational challenges in france as our efforts to integrate our businesses have negatively affected our ability to drive growth in sales the decrease was partially offset by product cost inflation in europe and canada and a modest increase in volumes in canada ireland and sweden our businesses in latin america primarily in costa rica and panama have experienced continued growth in sales partially offset by softness in our business in mexico which in the fourth quarter began to show recovery from weaker performance earlier in fiscal 2019  

operating income 

operating income decreased by 353 in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018  primarily as a result of the continued strategic investments we are making across europe to drive continued future business performance operating income on an adjusted basis increased by 343 million  or 107  as compared to fiscal 2018  

gross profit dollars decreased 448 million in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to currency translation in europe and canada partially offset by increasing product costs and local case growth in our canadian operations 

operating expenses increased 236 million in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to restructuring charges largely in france and supply chain transformation costs in the uk these activities resulted in restructuring charges that were combined with our brakes acquisitionrelated costs that are included within certain items we incurred restructuring charges of 611 million relating to our france integration during fiscal 2019  operating expense on an adjusted basis decreased 37  or 791 million  compared to fiscal 2018  we have also begun to leverage broader sysco capabilities and processes to deliver improved synergies across europe additionally our regionalization efforts in canada continue to deliver benefits and have helped to drive improved cost performance changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign operating expenses into us dollars further contributed to a decrease in operating expenses 

results of sygma and other segment 

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 

sales 

sales were 48 lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018  the decrease for fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to a modest decline in case volumes as we continue to focus on improving overall profitability 

operating income 

operating income increased by 142 in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  due to improved gross margins and solid expense management gross margin increased 30 basis points driven by higher product margins while operating expenses decreased 19 in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2019 largely due to decreases in transportation costs primarily resulting from our focus on removing unproductive miles and streamlining operations at underperforming locations 

“other” segment information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds primarily including our hotel supply operations and sysco labs which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers and provides support for some of our business technology needs 

operating income decreased 92  or 36 million  in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  the decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable results from our hotel supply operations partially offset by improved results from sysco labs guest supply gross profit grew 23 while operating expenses grew 71 during fiscal 2019  

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses in fiscal 2019 increased 672 million  or 69  as compared to fiscal 2018  due primarily to an increase in expenses related to our business technology initiatives including accelerated depreciation on certain enterprise resource planning erp systems and software platforms that we are no longer using along with higher payrelated expenses partly driven by higher severance and relocation charges corporate expenses on an adjusted basis decreased 129 million  or 15  as compared to fiscal 2018 certain items impacting fiscal 2019 totaled 1711 million and were primarily expenses associated with our business transformation initiatives as well as severance charges associated with our organizational changes as compared to 910 million in fiscal 2018  

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 351 million in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily due to a favorable comparison to the prior year as a result of the redemption of certain series of senior notes and debentures pursuant to a tender offer in fiscal 2018 interest charges related to the redemption costs noted above are considered certain items excluding certain items our interest expense increased 180 million in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018  due to higher floating interest rates and a higher average balance of fixed rate debt 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 170 in fiscal 2019  as compared to the prior year due primarily to the items noted above for operating income and interest expense as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 20  “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 these included the favorable impact of foreign tax credits generated as a result of distributions to sysco from our foreign operations at the end of fiscal 2018 lower us tax rates resulting from the enactment of the tax act and the favorable impact of excess tax benefits of equitybased compensation adjusted net earnings increased 119 in fiscal 2019  primarily due to gross profit growth and favorable expense growth including reduced administrative expense partially offset by increased interest expense which resulted in earnings growth that exceeded our operating income growth 

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were 324  an 182 increase from the fiscal 2018 amount of 274 per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were 320  an 183 increase from the fiscal 2018 amount of 270 per share adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 were 355  a 131 increase from the fiscal 2018 amount of 314 per share these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our share repurchases in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018  

nongaap reconciliations 

our discussion below and elsewhere herein of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives 2 severance and facility closure charges and 

3 restructuring charges our results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were also impacted by the following acquisitionrelated items 1 intangible amortization expense and 2 integration costs fiscal 2019 results of operations were impacted by a gain on the sale of iowa premium in addition fiscal 2018 results of operations were impacted by mepp withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges sysco’s results of operations for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were also impacted by reform measures from the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 the impact for fiscal 2019 and 2018 includes a transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and the impact for fiscal 2019 also includes the recognition of a foreign tax credit applicable to repatriated earnings the impact for fiscal 2018 includes 1 a net benefit from remeasuring sysco’s accrued income taxes deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates and 2 a benefit from contributions made to fund the us retirement plan pension plan the fiscal 2019 and 2018 items described above and excluded from our nongaap measures are collectively referred to as “certain items” all acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2019 and 2018 that have been designated as certain items relate to the fiscal 2017 brakes acquisition discussed in note 5  “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 in addition with respect to the adjusted return on invested capital targets our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the brakes acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition 

management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations 2 facilitates comparisons on a yearoveryear basis and 3 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that as a result are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity 

although sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions the brakes group was significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by sysco with a proportionately greater impact on sysco’s consolidated financial statements accordingly sysco is excluding from its nongaap financial measures for the relevant period solely those acquisition costs specific to the brakes acquisition we believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of sysco’s results for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018  

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the table below each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above in the table below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding

sysco management considers adjusted return on invested capital roic to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the company’s longterm capital investments in addition we have targets and expectations that are based on adjusted results including an adjusted roic target of 16 under our threeyear plan we cannot predict with certainty whether or when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of our roic in such future periods will be on an adjusted basis due to the effect of certain items which would be excluded from such calculation due to these uncertainties to the extent our future calculation of roic is on an adjusted basis excluding certain items we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly comparable gaap measure without unreasonable effort however we would expect to calculate adjusted roic if applicable in the same manner as we have historically calculated this measure all components of our adjusted roic calculation would be impacted by certain items we calculate adjusted roic as adjusted net earnings divided by i stockholders’ equity computed as the average of adjusted stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year and ii longterm debt computed as the average of the longterm debt at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year 



additional targets and expectations for our threeyear plan include target amounts for adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share we cannot predict with certainty when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of these measures in such future period will be on an adjusted basis due to the effect of certain items which would be excluded from such calculation due to uncertainties in projecting certain items during the period covered under our threeyear strategic plan we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of any of our nongaap operating income earnings per share or roic measures to the respective most directly comparable gaap measures without unreasonable effort however we would expect to calculate these adjusted results in the same manner as the reconciliations provided for the historical periods that are presented herein the impact of future certain items could cause projected nongaap amounts to differ significantly from our gaap results 

liquidity and capital resources 

highlights 

below are comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2018  



 in addition with regard to our senior notes 

 

sources and uses of cash 

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

 

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as credit monitoring optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations seasonal trends also impact our cash flows from operations and free cash flow as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases throughout the remainder of the year 

we extend credit terms to our customers that can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness in the ordinary course of business customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable the company may utilize purchase arrangements with thirdparty financial institutions to transfer portions of our trade accounts receivable balance on a nonrecourse basis in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow the arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales see note 1  “summary of accounting policies” for additional information 

as of june 29 2019  we had 5135 million in cash and cash equivalents approximately 58 of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to withholding and additional foreign tax obligations additionally 

sysco corporation has provided intercompany loans to certain of its international subsidiaries and when interest and principal payments are made some of this cash will move to the us 

our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive must maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund future reserve payments as of june 29 2019  the captive held 1200 million of fixed income marketable securities and 188 million of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in a restricted investment portfolio in order to meet solvency requirements we purchased 1164 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2019 of which none were sold during the year 

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

 

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary 

cash flows 

operating activities 

we generated 24 billion and 22 billion in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2019 and in fiscal 2018  respectively these amounts include yearoveryear favorable comparisons on other longterm liabilities and accrued expenses as well as higher operating results partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on accrued income taxes the cash impact of our certain items increased 511 million yearoveryear the cash impact of certain items can differ from the earnings impact of certain items as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the certain item charges were recognized in the statement of consolidated results of operations 

the change in other longterm liabilities was impacted primarily by the positive comparison of pension contributions made in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 pension contributions were 372 million in fiscal 2019 and 4150 million in fiscal 2018 including a 380 million contribution to the us retirement plan in fiscal 2018 

the positive comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to a 701 million increase in accrued severance primarily related to restructuring in our european operations and a 342 million decrease in mepp liability payments 

our tax payments in fiscal 2019 were higher than in fiscal 2018 as a result of the tax act primarily due to the impact on fiscal 2018 of certain capital allocation initiatives in the us such as funding our pension plan and fleet spend acceleration as well as payment in fiscal 2019 of canadian withholding taxes attributable to the repatriation of canadian earnings at the end of fiscal 2018 we made tax payments of approximately 5311 million in fiscal 2019  we expect future tax payments to grow with our earnings 

investing activities 

fiscal 2019 capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2018 capital expenditures included 



 

the level of gross capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 increased 46 million as compared to fiscal 2018  

we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2020 to be approximately 13 of fiscal sales fiscal 2020 expenditures are expected to include facility expansions and new facility construction fleet and other equipment purchases including replacements and investments in technology 

during fiscal 2019  the company paid cash of 1066 million for acquisitions net of cash acquired including waugh foods inc j  m wholesale meats and imperio foods inc within us foodservice operations classic drinks and the remaining interest in iowa premium making the previously consolidated entity a wholly owned subsidiary which was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 

during fiscal 2018  the company paid cash of 2481 million for acquisitions net of cash acquired including hfm foodservice and doerle food services within us foodservice operations and kent frozen foods eko fågel fisk  mittemellan and the remaining 50 interest in our joint venture in costa rica within our international foodservice operations 

during fiscal 2019 the company received 1499 million in proceeds from the sale of a business these dispositions resulted in a recognized gain of 663 million  which is included within other income in the consolidated results of operations 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions however free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments our free cash flow for fiscal 2019 increased 168  or 2499 million  to 17 billion  as compared to fiscal 2018  principally as a result of a yearoveryear increase in cash flows from operations 

nongaap reconciliation 

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable gaap measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap in the table that follows free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 



financing activities 

equity transactions 

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 2531 million in fiscal 2019 and 2688 million in fiscal 2018  the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire 

we routinely engage in share repurchase programs we repurchased a total of 14963189 shares in fiscal 2019 for 10 billion and 17930114 shares in fiscal 2018 for 9789 million  in february 2017 our board of directors approved a repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the company’s common stock not to exceed 10 billion through the end of fiscal 

2019 all of which were executed through august 2018 in november 2017 our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company’s common stock not to exceed 15 billion through the end of fiscal 2020 we have repurchased approximately 20500 additional shares for 14 million in fiscal 2020 through august 9 2019  the current repurchase program is intended to allow sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases in fiscal 2020  we intend to increase the share repurchase amount to over 1 billion  which repurchases will involve opportunistic purchases and purchases to offset dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans in august 2019 our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company’s common stock not to exceed 25 billion through the end of fiscal 2021 

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception dividends paid were 7754 million  or 150 per share in fiscal 2019 and 7222 million  or  138 per share in fiscal 2018  in may 2019  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of 039 per share which was paid in july 2019  we expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2020  

in august 2018 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer had the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 9 2019  29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

debt activity and borrowing availability 

our debt activity including issuances and repayments and our borrowing availability is described in note 13  “debt and other financing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 our outstanding borrowings at june 29 2019  and repayment activity since the end of fiscal 2019 are disclosed within those notes updated amounts at august 9 2019  include 

 

our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 247 for fiscal 2019 and 171 for fiscal 2018  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of june 29 2019  certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 



 

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only if certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 29 2019 were 189 million  this amount is not included in the table above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the goodwill and intangible assets income taxes sharebased compensation and companysponsored pension plans 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values we use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we generally use the income method which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill more information on our acquisitions can be found in note 5  “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

annually in our fourth quarter we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets impairment reviews outside our annual review time frame are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment however if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is performed 

when using a quantitative test we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit we use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2019  sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during fiscal 2019 we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2019 assessment impairment charges would have been applicable for two reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by 13 and 15  respectively with goodwill of 2260 million in the aggregate as of june 29 2019 recorded for these reporting units 

certain reporting units have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

sharebased compensation 

sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans a nonemployee director plan and the 2015 employee stock purchase plan espp 

as of june 29 2019  there was 1164 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 18 years  

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award and performance share unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units and performance share units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period expense recognized on performance share unit awards is subsequently adjusted based on forecasted performance compared to planned targets until the performance period concludes and the actual number of shares of sysco common stock to be received upon the vesting of the performance share units is known 

the fair value of the stock issued under the espp is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or nonemployee directors is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the espp is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

our sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement in these cases 

we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our us retirement plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees our serp is frozen and is not open to any employees none of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates specific to our results of operations but such changes could impact our balance sheet due to a change in our funded status due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is not a critical assumption 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan is 500 for fiscal 2019  consistent with fiscal 2018 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan is 500 for fiscal 2020  consistent with fiscal 2019 investments in the portfolio have been reallocated to a higher portion of fixed income assets resulting in a lower expected longterm rate of return a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return in the plan for fiscal 2020 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2019 by approximately 39 million  

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 29 2019 was a charge net of tax of 12 billion  the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 30 2018 was a charge net of tax of 11 billion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risks consist of interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk fuel price risk and investment risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

at june 29 2019  there was 1321 million in commercial paper issuances outstanding total debt as of june 29 2019 was 78 billion  of which approximately 70 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

at june 30 2018  there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding total debt as of june 30 2018 was 83 billion  of which approximately 74 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

details of our outstanding swap agreements as of june 29 2019 are below 



we receive or pay amounts on these interest rate swap agreements on a semiannual basis 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of june 29 2019  all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 



 



rate a – threemonth libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our largest currency exposures are with canadian dollars british pound sterling and euro currencies our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively affected sales by 08 in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018  the exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively affected sales by 10 in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017  the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018  a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2019 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively affected fiscal 2019 sales by 17 and would not have materially affected our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our investments and loans to our foreign operations created additional foreign currency exposure in fiscal 2017 we designated €500 million of euro notes issued in june 2016 and various cross currency swaps as hedges of a portion of our net investment in eurodenominated and sterlingdenominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations changes in the value of these items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to us dollar exchange rates are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss in fiscal 2018 we entered into various cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of exchange rate changes for 

intercompany loans that are not in the functional currency of our subsidiaries these have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes recorded within foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 05 of sales during fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges that primarily track with the change in market prices of fuel we use diesel fuel swap contracts to fix the price of a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 29 2019  we had diesel fuel swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 51 million gallons through june 2020  these swaps are expected to lock in the price of approximately 60 of our projected fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2020  our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 95 million in our fuel costs on our noncontracted volumes 

investment risk 

our us retirement plan holds various investments including public and private equity fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plans at the plans’ fiscal year end  december 31 2018  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2020  however such an unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2020 by 332 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 29 2019 by 3984 million

reporting segments 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise we have aggregated certain operating segments into three reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

 

broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in note 20  “business segment information”  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

customers and products 

sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served services to our customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

the products we distribute include 

 we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

 

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 



our distribution centers which we refer to as operating companies distribute branded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training 

and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no  single customer accounted for 10  or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018  

we estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 



 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none  of which individually accounts for more than 10  of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers we also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to midsized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products our locally sourced products including produce meats cheese and other products help differentiate our customers’ offerings satisfy demands for new products and support local communities purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs domestically and internationally and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources” regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

we extend credit terms to our customers that can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 45  days or more 

corporate headquarters and shared services center 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies and our shared services center performs support services for employees suppliers and customers members of these groups possess experience and expertise in among other areas customer and vendor contract administration accounting and finance treasury legal information technology payroll and employee benefits risk management and insurance sales and marketing merchandising inbound logistics human resources strategy and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available supply chain expertise such as in warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  6878 million  6864 million  and 5273 million  respectively were invested in delivery fleet facilities technology and other capital asset enhancements from time to time we dispose of assets in the normal course of business we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets were 6656 million  6627 million  and 5038 million  respectively capital expenditures as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were 11  12  and 10  respectively we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2019  should be approximately 12  to 13  of sales during the three years ended june 30 2018  capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2019  capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

as of june 30 2018  we had approximately 67000  employees approximately 24  of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 19  of our union employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal 2019  which contracts are subject to renegotiation since june 30 2018  there have been no  contract renegotiations we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

competition 

there are a large number of companies engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores online retailers or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors some organizations compete with us on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently product needs service requirements and price are just a few of the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly there are few barriers to market entry existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers 

we estimate that we serve about 16  of an approximately 289 billion  annual foodservice market in the united states us based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2017  based on industry data obtained from technomic inc we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2018  while comprehensive industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our operations in the us and canada are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in those trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our marketing associates our diversified product base which includes qualityassured sysco brand products the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis and our multiregional presence in north america and europe which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time 

we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements there are a small number of companies competing in the foodawayfromhome industry in the us with publicly traded equity while our public company status provides us with some advantages over many of our competitors including access to capital we believe it also puts us at a disadvantage in that most of our competitors do not face the obligations and additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements applicable to public companies 

government regulation 

our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business 

in the us as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda the fda regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption as well as food defense which is a responsibility of the department of homeland security 

the recently published rules under the food safety modernization act fsma will significantly expand our food safety requirements among other things fda regulations implementing the fsma require us to establish and maintain comprehensive preventionbased controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated the fsma further imposes new requirements for food products imported into the us and provides the fda with mandatory recall authority in particular the final rule on the sanitary transportation of food which became effective for sysco in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 required us to enhance certain of our systems to ensure that we met the rule’s new standards for maintaining the safety of food during transportation 

we and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the fda biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the fda and usda our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal andor state authorities we also must establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute 

our customers include several departments of the federal government including the department of defense and department of veterans affairs facilities as well as certain state and local entities these customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors 

we are also subject to regulation by numerous federal state and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor which sets employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation as well as its agencies the surface transportation board the federal highway administration the federal motor carrier safety administration and the national highway traffic safety administration which collectively regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations safety insurance and hazardous materials we must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the federal motor carrier safety administration including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hoursof service such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations we are 

subject to regulations of the federal aviation administration covering items transported by air in addition we are subject to the us false claims act and similar state statutes which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized we have implemented and continue to develop a robust anticorruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anticorruption laws in countries where we operate 

our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate including the sherman antitrust act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the us these laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices boycotting competitors or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition in many jurisdictions compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions 

outside the us our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations as well as other legal and regulatory requirements for example we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the european union the eu as well as those of eu countries where we conduct business including the uk ireland france and sweden which requirements relate to among other things competition product composition packaging labeling advertisement and the safety of food products as well as the health safety and working conditions of employees we are subject to privacy laws in the eu including the new regulation that became effective in may 2018 the general   data   protection   regulation  gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data in addition our business is subject to the uk modern slavery act 2015 which requires certain companies that operate in the uk to prepare a report describing steps taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chain or business as well as the uk bribery act 2010 an anticorruption law that restricts the offer or payment of anything of value to both government officials as well as to other nongovernmental persons with the intent of gaining favorable government action business or an advantage 

all of our company’s facilities and other operations in the us and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those in the us and the eu relating to 1 the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater 2 the discharge of pollutants into the air including vehicle emissions 3 proper handling treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes and 4 protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases further most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks see “item 1a risk factors  business and operational risks  we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance” 

general 

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco® and brakes® trademarks in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry in north america approximately half of our privately branded sales are from products labeled with our sysco® trademark without any other trademark we believe the loss of the sysco® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in europe approximately 26  of our privately branded european sales are from products labeled with the brakes® trademark both our us and european trademarks are effective for a tenyear period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use the company does not have any material patents or licenses 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

as of june 30 2018  we operated 332  distribution facilities throughout north america and europe 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and from historical trends 

industry and general economic risks 

our industry is characterized by low margins and periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of significant product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our results of operations to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers in a timely manner in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may negatively impact our business due to the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive environment conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our results of operations may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in north america and europe as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the foodservice industry is characterized by relatively low profit margins with modest demand growth expected in the nearterm and consequently our results of operations are susceptible to regional national and international economic trends and uncertainties economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

 

historically north america and europe have experienced from time to time deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in their financial markets which adversely impacted business and consumer confidence and spending and depressed capital investment and economic activity in the affected regions if similar unfavorable economic conditions were to arise in the future our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the uk’s exit from the european union the eu could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the uk’s anticipated exit from the eu and the resulting significant change to the uk’s relationship with the eu and with countries outside the eu and its laws and regulations impacting business conducted between them could disrupt the overall stability of the uk and the eu and otherwise negatively impact our european operations if changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods services and workers between the uk and the eu our european operations could also be negatively impacted the completion of the uk’s exit from the eu could adversely affect the value of our euro and pounddenominated assets and obligations exchange rates related to the british pound sterling have been more volatile since the uk announced it 

would exit the eu and such volatility may continue in the future future fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the local currencies of our suppliers may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the uk which increases we may not be able to pass on to our customers in addition the uk’s exit from the eu could cause financial and capital markets within and outside the eu to constrict thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business and could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry any one of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

competition and the impact of gpos may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional and multiregional distributors and specialty competitors local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach private label offerings overall purchasing power cost efficiencies and ability to meet customer distribution requirements these suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures online direct food wholesalers and cash and carry operations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

moreover some of our customers purchase their products from us through group purchasing organizations or “gpos” in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders gpos have a relatively larger presence in the healthcare lodging and foodservice management customer segments if these gpos are able to add a significant number of our customers as members it may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting or other concessions such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices which could also adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the   costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past through among other things our fuel surcharge program there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future if fuel costs increase in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements including fuel derivatives to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices there can be no assurance that our fuel hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices and if fuel prices decrease significantly these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel in addition our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that one of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations whether due to its insolvency or otherwise which could result in financial losses 

business and operational risks 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include shortages of qualified labor for our suppliers work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages animal disease outbreaks transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands terrorist attacks or international hostilities and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period additionally we procure products from suppliers outside of the united states us and we are subject to the risks associated with political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade any or all of which could delay our receipt of product or increase our input costs our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

in addition as a foodservice distributor it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products and declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase the product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory adversely affecting our results of operations 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business sysco’s brand names trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to illegal or unethical activities by our employees suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis salmonella listeria or swine flu or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact public confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our results of operations to decrease dramatically 

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and   services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time market competition customer requirements customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers our customer agreements are generally terminable upon written notice by either us or the customer which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes to the mix of locally managed customers versus multiunit customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing the volume of our sales to locally managed customers is very important for our business and our results of operations gross margin from our multiunit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locally managed customers if sales to our locally managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multiunit customers our operating margins may decline 

moreover if sales to our multiunit customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locally managed customers we will become more dependent on multiunit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales additionally the loss of sales to the larger of these multiunit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers we could be pressured by them to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases our results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in consumer eating habits such as a decline in consuming food away from home a decline in portion sizes or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers could reduce demand for our products consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods there is a growing consumer preference for sustainable organic and locally grown products and a shift towards plantbased proteins andor animal proteins derived from animals that were humanely treated and antibiotic free 

changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts millennials the largest demographic group in terms of spend seek new and different as well as more ethnic menu options and menu innovation if consumer eating habits change significantly we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio and we may experience higher costs andor supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to the new eating preferences changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home additionally changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products compliance with these laws and regulations as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products may be costly and timeconsuming we cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits 

we may not be able to achieve our threeyear financial targets by the end of fiscal year 2020 

in fiscal 2018 we set new threeyear financial targets to grow operating income accelerate earnings per share growth faster than operating income growth and improve return on invested capital our ability to meet these financial targets depends largely on our successful execution of our business plan including various related initiatives there are various risks related to these efforts including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame if at all and may prove costlier than expected and the risk of adverse effects to our business results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings and the associated changes to our business do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate our intentions and expectations with regard to the execution of our business plan and the timing of any related initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs if we are unable to successfully execute our business plan whether due to our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our various business initiatives in the anticipated time frame or otherwise we may be unable to achieve our threeyear financial targets 

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful  

an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected 

by political economic and social conditions beyond our control local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example the us and many countries in the eu where we do business are actively considering or have recently enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals 

in particular the us government enacted in december 2017 comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code the estimated impacts of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report the final effects of the tax act may differ materially from our estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act any further legislative actions to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act andor any updates to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the effects in addition as discussed more fully at note 18  “income taxes”  our accounting for certain elements of the tax act is provisional and we have recorded reasonable estimates of the effects of those elements in our financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k completion of our accounting for such elements could result in charges or other adjustments that would impact our financial results for fiscal 2019 

further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified we are also subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are appropriate there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

given the breadth and complexity of the tax act as well as the unpredictability of possible further changes to the us or foreign tax laws and regulations and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on our results of operations and cash flow but such laws and regulations and changes thereto could adversely impact our financial results 

if the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims 

we like any other foodservice distributor may be subject to product recalls including voluntary recalls or withdrawals if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness to have been mislabeled misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations we may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards whether for taste appearance or otherwise in order to protect our brand and reputation any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures destruction of product inventory damage to our reputation andor lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco are alleged to have caused injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is 

unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business  

we are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many aspects of our business such as food safety and sanitation ethical business practices transportation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs for a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject please refer to “business  government regulation” in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance 

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 

 

in the course of our operations we operate maintain and fuel fleet vehicles store fuel in onsite above and underground storage tanks operate refrigeration systems and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes we could incur substantial costs including fines or penalties and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment in addition we could incur investigation remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties 

for example most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks certain of these laws and regulations in the eu may impose liability for costs of investigation or remediation of contamination which could be material regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal and even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of our operations at the site and was not caused by our activities in addition many of our facilities 

have propane and battery powered forklifts proposed or recently enacted legal requirements such as those requiring the phaseout of certain ozonedepleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may require us to upgrade or replace equipment or may increase our transportation or other operating costs 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments in addition our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with respect to a significant acquired business could result in material weaknesses andor a failure to file our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission on a timely basis 

we need access to borrowed funds to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

as described in note 11  “debt and other financing arrangements”  as of june 30 2018  we had approximately 83 billion  of total indebtedness this amount included senior notes and issuances under a commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 20 billion  we also have a revolving credit facility supporting our us commercial paper program in the amount of 20 billion  scheduled to expire on november 2 2021  and various other smaller bank facilities 

our level of indebtedness could have important consequences for us including 

 

our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures potential acquisitions joint ventures andor share repurchase programs our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of future debt financing and financial results and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

we rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis we also use mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and customers further our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners 

these technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters power outages systems failures security breaches espionage cyberattacks viruses theft and inadvertent release of information any such disruption to these software and other technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated or the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability including  litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties fines fees or liabilities which may not be covered by our insurance policies  and competitive disadvantage any or all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits moreover a cybersecurity breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect personal information against cyberattacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information which could result in a disruption of our operations 

further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks 

while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents as well as disaster recovery plans these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations additionally information technology systems continue to evolve and in order to remain competitive we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner if our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in addition data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries where we do business for example the eu adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018 the general   data   protection   regulation  gdpr which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the requirements of gdpr and other laws and regulations in this area could result in substantial fines or penalties and legal liability and could tarnish our reputation 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 13  of our current us employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2018  our total contributions to these plans were approximately 464 million  the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan we could also be treated as partially withdrawing from 

participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain percentage over a certain period of time such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations such as facility closures or consolidations based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 131 million  as of june 30 2018  a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

at the end of fiscal 2012  we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan us retirement plan as of december 31 2012  for all us based salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013  these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 40 billion  as of june 30 2018  therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements see note 13  “companysponsored employee benefit plans”  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the us retirement plan 

the amount of our annual contribution to the us retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the us retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability in fiscal 2018 the company made voluntary contributions of 380  million to the us retirement plan allowing the company to set an investment strategy that more closely aligns the duration of the us retirement plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities as a result our us retirement plan holds a greater amount of investments in fixed income securities but also holds equity securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the us retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse effect on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience significant future declines andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

as of june 30 2018  we had approximately 67000  employees approximately 24  of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 19  of our union employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal 2019  which contracts are subject to renegotiation failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability and the ability of thirdparties on which we rely to supply and to deliver our products to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business employee recruitment development and retention efforts undertaken by us andor such thirdparties may not be successful resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods any such shortage could decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties and a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result 

in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

the table below shows the number of distribution facilities occupied by sysco in each country and the aggregate square footage devoted to cold and dry storage as of june 30 2018  



 

we own approximately 38134000  square feet of our distribution facilities or 779  of the total square feet and the remainder is occupied under leases expiring at various dates from fiscal 2019  to fiscal 2063  exclusive of renewal options 

we own our approximately 625000  square foot headquarters office complex in houston texas in addition we own our approximately 669000  square foot complex in cypress texas that houses shared business services and other corporate services 

we are currently constructing expansions or buildouts for our distribution facilities in georgia florida and quebec  these operating companies in the aggregate accounted for 2  of fiscal 2018  sales 

as of june 30 2018  our fleet of approximately 14000  delivery vehicles consisted of tractor and trailer combinations vans and panel trucks most of which are either wholly or partially refrigerated for the transportation of frozen or perishable foods we own approximately 88  of these vehicles and lease the remainder

 item 5   market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer repurchases of equity securities 

the principal market for sysco’s common stock syy is the new york stock exchange the table below sets forth the high and low sales prices per share for our common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange composite tape and the cash dividends declared for the periods indicated 



the number of record owners of sysco’s common stock as of august 10 2018  was 9169  

we currently expect that comparable quarterly cash dividends will continue to be paid in the future however future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our board of directors 

we made the following share repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  



 

in february 2017  our board of directors approved a repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the company’s common stock not to exceed 10 billion  through the end of fiscal 2019  in november 2017  our board of directors approved a repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company’s common stock not to exceed 15 billion  through the end of fiscal 2020  these repurchase programs are intended to allow sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases these share repurchase programs were approved using a dollar value limit and therefore are not included in the table above for “maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs” 

we purchased 17930114  shares under these plans in fiscal 2018  resulting in a remaining authorization under these programs of approximately 15 billion  as of june 30 2018 there were 35744589  shares repurchased under our then outstanding plans in fiscal 2017  we purchased approximately 1344000  additional shares under these authorizations through august 10 2018  

the board of directors has authorized us to enter into agreements from time to time to extend our ongoing repurchase program to include repurchases during company announced “blackout periods” of such securities in compliance with rule 10b51 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be 

denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016 as a result of which we incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform as opposed to completing the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system 2 professional fees related to our threeyear strategic plans 3 restructuring expenses within our brakes group operations 4 severance charges related to restructuring and 5 foreign nonincome based taxes in addition fiscal 2018 results of operations are impacted by business technology transformation initiative costs facility closure charges multiemployer pension mepp withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges which are also excluded from our nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented in this report also exclude the impact of the following acquisitionrelated items 1 intangible amortization expense and 2 integration costs all acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 that have been excluded relate to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of cucina lux investments limited the brakes acquisition discussed in note 4  “acquisitions”  the brakes acquisition also resulted in nonrecurring tax expense in fiscal 2017 primarily from nondeductible transaction costs 

the nongaap financial measures presented in this report further exclude certain impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tax act enacted on december 22 2017  the impact for fiscal 2018  includes a provisional estimate of a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a net benefit from remeasuring sysco’s accrued income taxes deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates other taxrelated items impacting results of operations include foreign withholding taxes on repatriated earnings net of foreign tax credits and a benefit from contributions made to fund sysco’s taxqualified united states us pension plan the us retirement plan 

the fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  items described above and excluded from our nongaap measures are collectively referred to as “certain items” in addition our threeyear plan that ended in fiscal 2018 included an adjusted return on invested capital target that excluded the brakes acquisition and therefore our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the brakes acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30th this resulted in a 52week year ending june 30 2018 for fiscal 2018 a 52week year ending july 1 2017 for fiscal 2017 and a 53week year ending july 2 2016 for fiscal 2016 because fiscal 2016 contained one additional week as compared to fiscal 2017 our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2017 are not directly comparable to fiscal 2016 management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016 consolidated results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis sysco’s results of operations and related metrics within this section will be disclosed on both a 52week and 53week basis for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 this is calculated by deducting onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 

any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of certain items more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe the company has aggregated certain of its operating segments into three  reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

 

we estimate that we serve about 16  of an approximately 289 billion  annual foodservice market in the us based on industry data obtained from technomic inc from time to time technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and as a result our percentage can change not only from our sales results but also from such revisions we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share 

according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 51  of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar 2017  industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the us experienced a real sales increase of approximately 14  in both calendar year 2017  and calendar year 2016  real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation

fiscal 2015  fiscal 2018 threeyear plan highlights 



 

fiscal 2018 marked the completion of our initial threeyear plan that was established in fiscal 2016 as a result of our efforts in connection with the threeyear plan we accelerated local case growth by 30  achieved adjusted gross profit cagr of 42  and managed adjusted operating expense cagr to 22  this gap between adjusted gross profit dollar growth and adjusted expense dollar growth created adjusted operating leverage of 20 percentage points which generated adjusted operating income growth of 6651  million exceeding the target range of 600 million to 650 million adjusted roic was 202  surpassing our target of 150 and we achieved a five day improvement in working capital which was one day above the original goal on 

a gaap basis comparing fiscal 2018  to fiscal 2015 the company achieved gross profit cagr of 90  and operating expense cagr of 61  generating operating income growth of 11 billion  roic was 130  our operating income goal was established on an adjusted basis given certain item charges that were applicable in fiscal 2015 which were primarily due to termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods and financing costs related to the senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2015 to fund the proposed us foods merger see “nongaap reconciliations” for an explanation of these nongaap financial measures 

the overall macroeconomic trends continue to be positive in the us and the underlying economic picture remains encouraging including a strong employment market this has resulted in a healthy consumer that is helping to drive a positive trend in restaurant sales we also see continued growth with local customers as they increase their reach through flexible menus innovative concepts and additional delivery options to reach consumers the uk market continues to experience acute product inflation in the midtohigh single digits 

throughout fiscal 2018  we improved our customer experience through enhanced service levels improved sales retention and higher customer loyalty enhanced associate engagement through improved workplace safety and improved associate retention through attractive career growth opportunities these were all key targeted steps towards achieving our initial threeyear plan financial objectives 

our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price volume and product mix the modest level of growth in the foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures which can impact our profitability the majority of our sales are to locally managed customers and national customers our locally managed customers including independent restaurant customers comprise a greater percentage of our profitability as compared to national customers case growth with our locally managed broadline business is important to drive gross profit dollar growth our sales to national customers including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes gross margin on sales to our national customers is generally lower than on sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these customers in fiscal 2018 we accelerated our cases with local customers through improved processes enhanced training of our marketing associates and continued growth in our digital platform 

we offer an assortment of syscobranded products that we can differentiate from privately branded products which enables us to achieve higher gross profits as a result we focus on sales growth for these products now comprising 46  of us broadline sales especially with locally managed customers cutting edge solutions our product innovation platform which features our exclusive product offerings has now delivered one million cases of new on trend innovative products to our customers we have experienced continued success in category management as we introduce new categories to capture value inflation is a factor that contributes to the level of sales and gross profit growth and can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure we experienced inflation at a rate of 26  for fiscal 2018  inflation in fiscal 2018  occurred primarily in the meat dairy paper and disposables and frozen potatoes and vegetables categories partially offset by modest deflation in poultry in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the meat category was no longer experiencing inflation we expect inflation to continue for the balance of calendar 2018  periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have an unfavorable effect on us and our customers as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers a portion of the cost to obtain product includes inbound freight these costs have risen in fiscal 2018 driven by overall industry factors such as driver shortages and adjusting to electronic regulation of hours driven 

changes in exchange rates can impact our foreign sales as we convert them to us dollars in fiscal 2018 we experienced a foreign exchange benefit to total sales of 10  

we have experienced higher operating expenses in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  driven by ongoing strategic investments in the business that impacted the year including the investment in marketing associates in the us and the continued investment in technology that will translate to a more enriching experience for our customers we expect operating expenses to increase in fiscal 2019 primarily driven by anticipated growth in case volume we also expect transportation costs to increase due to higher fuel prices and a tight labor market we continue to make investments in europe including the supply chain transformation occurring in the uk technology and other integrations within europe 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the us government enacted the tax act comprehensive tax legislation that decreased the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for fiscal 2018 sysco had a 28 tax rate rather than 21 because the law was enacted during the midpoint of the company’s fiscal year requiring us to use a blended average rate the company’s us federal statutory tax rate for fiscal 2019 and beyond will be 21 and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25 this rate is expected to be similar to the fiscal 2018 effective tax rate due to certain tax benefits that occurred in fiscal 2018 that will not fully repeat in fiscal 2019 our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate is lower than this range as a result of capital allocation initiatives as 

discussed in note 18  “income taxes”  we have recorded provisional estimates for some components of the tax act and will refine estimates and determine applicability for other components in future periods 

we continue to be focused on mergers and acquisitions as a part of our strategy and have completed several acquisitions in fiscal 2018 including two within us foodservice operations and two within international foodservice operations within us foodservice operations we acquired hfm foodservice hfm a hawaiibased broadline distributor with approximately 290 million in annual sales acquiring hfm provided sysco with direct access to the growing hawaiian market and was in clear alignment with our strategy for disciplined profitable growth of the business we also acquired doerle food services doerle a leading louisiana broadline distributor with approximately 250 million in annual foodservice distribution sales acquiring doerle provided sysco with a distributor that services parts of a sixstate area including oklahoma texas arkansas louisiana mississippi and alabama 

within our international foodservice operations we acquired kent frozen foods kff a ukbased distributor that distributes chilled frozen and ambient food products to the catering industry in the uk acquiring kff provided sysco europe with an enhanced presence with independent customers in the uk market we also acquired eko f å gel fisk  mittemellan a leading fresh fish preparation and distribution business in stockholm sweden in addition to the two acquisitions noted above in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we purchased the remaining 50 interest in our joint venture in costa rica sysco initially acquired a 50 interest in the foodservice company in fiscal 2015 

strategy and fiscal 2020 threeyear financial targets 

our objective to improve the overall customer experience is a core element of our success over the past few years and will continue to be a key focus as we move forward we have identified four strategic priorities that will accelerate our current growth and guide us into the future these priorities are to enrich the customer experience deliver operational excellence optimize our business and activate the power of our people 

in fiscal 2018 we outlined our new threeyear financial targets to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2020 including 

 

in accomplishing these goals we believe that by fiscal 2020 we could also achieve as compared to fiscal 2017 1 sales growth of 4 to 45 2 adjusted operating income growth of 9 and 3 adjusted diluted earnings per share results in the range of 385 to 395 in fiscal 2020 representing an increase of approximately 16 the objectives targeted in our new threeyear plan include the impact of the recently enacted us tax reform the key levers to achieve these targets include an emphasis on accelerating locally managed customer case growth and driving leverage between gross profit growth and expense growth our operating income goal was established on an adjusted basis given certain item charges that were applicable in fiscal 2018 which primarily were due to restructuring and brakesrelated acquisitions costs

segment results 

the following represents our results by reportable segments 







based on information in note 20  “business segment information”  in fiscal 2018  us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 675  and 196  respectively of sysco’s overall sales compared to 679  and 192  respectively in fiscal 2017 in fiscal 2018  us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 922  and 58  respectively of the total segment operating income compared to 907  and 76  respectively in fiscal 2017  this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses along with sales operating income is the most relevant measure for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources as operating income includes cost of goods sold as well as the costs to warehouse and deliver goods which are significant and relevant costs when evaluating a distribution business 

results of us foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2018  the us foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 675  of sysco’s overall sales and 922  of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s reporting segments there are several factors that contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 





sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the prior year in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



 

sales were 54  higher in fiscal 2018  than in fiscal 2017  the largest drivers of the increase were the impact of product cost inflation and case volume growth in our us broadline operations case volumes for the company’s us broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months increased 29  in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  and included a 36  improvement in locally managed customer case growth along with an increase of 19  in national customer case volume including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted locally managed customer sales by 08  therefore organic local case volume which excludes acquisitions grew 28  resulting in 17 consecutive quarters of growth 

sales were 05  lower in fiscal 2017  than in fiscal 2016  the largest driver of the decrease was the extra week in fiscal 2016  which we estimate contributed 08 of the sales decline in fiscal 2017  case volumes for the company’s us broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months declined 10  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  we estimate that the extra week contributed 20  of the 10  case decline absent the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016  case volume grew primarily from locally managed customers other items impacting the change in sales but to a lesser extent were pricing management of product cost deflation and product mix 

operating income 

operating income increased by 55  in fiscal 2018  over fiscal 2017  primarily due to our gross profits growing at a faster pace than operating expenses 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to a customer mix that has continued to improve as we accelerated local case growth as compared to national cases additionally growth in sales of syscobranded products contributed positively to gross profit dollar growth our case growth for syscobranded sales to local customers increased 61  basis points for fiscal 2018  the change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation was estimated as inflation of 26  during fiscal 2018  for our us broadline operations inflation in fiscal 2018  occurred primarily in the meat dairy paper and disposables produce and frozen potatoes and vegetables categories partially offset by modest deflation in poultry partially offsetting the gross profit increase was an increase in inbound freight costs that have risen due to overall industry factors such as driver shortages and adjusting to electronic regulation of hours driven 

operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to increased supply chain costs in both transportation and warehouse these costs were largely due to a combination of a tight labor market rising fuel costs weather impacts through the year and ramp up costs for new business our ongoing investment in our selling organization to help grow the business has also contributed to the increase in operating expenses 

operating income increased by 43  in fiscal 2017  over fiscal 2016  primarily due to our gross profits growing at a faster pace than operating expenses higher gross profits were achieved as we managed the deflationary environment in the first part of the year and operating expense increases were limited reflecting favorable expense management we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016  partially offset by 20  the yearoveryear operating income growth 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to effective management of deflation a more beneficial mix of local customer case growth and increased sales of syscobranded products to local customers our case growth for syscobranded sales to local customers increased 62  basis points for fiscal 2017  the change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation was estimated as deflation of 04  during fiscal 2017  for our us broadline 

operations deflation in fiscal 2017  occurred primarily in the meat dairy and produce categories partially offset by modest inflation in other categories 

operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to costs associated with multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs in fiscal 2017  and indirect spend these increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016  reduced fuel costs and payrelated expenses indirect spend includes costs such as fleet maintenance and supplies 

results of international foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2018  the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 196  of sysco’s overall sales and 58  of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 





1  fiscal 2017 excludes the impact of the brakes acquisition 

sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



 

sales were 85  higher in fiscal 2018  than in fiscal 2017  the increase for fiscal 2018  was primarily due to favorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars as well as product cost inflation in europe and canada and a modest increase in volumes in our canadian operations the increase was partially offset by a small decline in volumes in europe due to softer market conditions 

sales were 952  higher in fiscal 2017  than in fiscal 2016  the increase for fiscal 2017  was primarily due to the acquisition of the brakes group which added 52 billion  during the year the increase was partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 a small decline in volume primarily in canada and unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars we had a modest decrease in sales in canada due to softer market conditions 

operating income 

operating income decreased by 205  in fiscal 2018  from fiscal 2017  primarily as a result of the strategic investments we are making in our european supply chain we continue to focus on executing against our longterm plans by investing in necessary capabilities across the international foodservice business 

gross profit dollars increased 1611 million  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to a combination of product costs increasing and currency translation in the uk along with local case growth in our canadian operations 

operating expenses increased 2110 million  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily due to supply chain transformation costs in the uk and increased supply chain costs in canada the supply chain transformation work in the uk to transition from a single temperature warehouse and fleet into a multitemperature network is progressing well in canada the increase in supply chain costs was driven by increased case volumes and the resulting increase in transportation costs we have concluded the merger of brake france and davigel to form sysco france which will provide new capabilities and the unique multitemperature service that will better adapt to our customers’ growing needs as well as access to new customer segments integration of these businesses in france will continue through fiscal 2019 additionally the integration of pallas and brakes in ireland is nearly complete and we have achieved strong cost synergies throughout the year across europe we are also making technology investments to improve the infrastructure and to enhance our suite of customer facing tools in mexico we absorbed the cost of adding a new large customer during the year 

operating income increased by 372  in fiscal 2017  from fiscal 2016  primarily attributable to the brakes acquisition the brakes group is progressing in its supply chain transformational efforts as it moves to multitemperature capability across the uk growth in france remains steady excluding the brakes group nongaap operating income adjusted for the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 increased 117  in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily from managing costs effectively in canada within a deflationary and somewhat softer market environment our joint venture in costa rica also experienced improved operating income performance 

gross profit dollars increased 13 billion  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to the brakes acquisition adjusted gross profit dollars excluding the impact of brakes and on a comparable 52 week basis increased 24  adjusted gross profit dollar growth was higher due to improved sales execution and implementation of our customer focused initiatives such as category management and revenue management in our canadian operations 

operating expenses increased 13 billion  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  largely due to the brakes acquisition adjusted operating expenses excluding brakes were flat in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  as a result of our effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity in the canadian business 

results of sygma and other segment 

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 

sales 

sales were 61  higher in fiscal 2018  than in fiscal 2017  the increase for fiscal 2018  was primarily attributable to case growth and product cost inflation case growth was primarily the result of increased volume from existing customers as well as new business acquired during the year sygma experienced product cost inflation of 25  during fiscal 2018  

sales were 13  higher in fiscal 2017  than in fiscal 2016  the increase for fiscal 2017  was primarily attributable to case growth case growth was primarily the result of increased volume from existing customers with additional new business also contributing to such growth 

operating income 

operating income increased by 44  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily driven by sales growth and partially offset by operating expense growth exceeding gross profit dollar growth gross profit dollars increased 85  driven by higher product margins while operating expenses increased 87  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018  largely due to increased transportation expenses resulting from driver hiring challenges and outsourced delivery costs to meet the high service level expectations of our customers 

operating income decreased by 152  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily driven by operating expense growth exceeding gross profit dollar growth gross profit dollars increased 33  while operating expenses increased 45  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  gross profit dollar growth was lower due to higher product margins operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017  largely due to higher payrelated expenses 

“other” segment information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds primarily including our hotel supply operations and sysco labs which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers and provides support for some of our business technology needs 

operating income increased 307  or 93 million  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to favorable results from our hotel supply operations and improved results from sysco labs 

operating income decreased 73  or 24 million  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  the decrease was primarily attributable to the extra week applicable to fiscal 2016 partially offset by favorable results from our hotel supply operations 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses in fiscal 2018  decreased 1550 million  or 137  as compared to fiscal 2017  due primarily to the favorable comparison of depreciation expense during fiscal 2017  we incurred 1841 million  of depreciation expense on our previous erp system which became fully depreciated at the end of fiscal 2017  a portion of this depreciation expense was included in certain items during fiscal 2017  the decrease in depreciation expenses along with a reduction in our estimates for our reserves for our selfinsurance program which covers portions of workers’ compensation general and vehicle liability were partially offset by an increase in business technology costs 

included in corporate expenses are certain items that totaled 910 million  in fiscal 2018  as compared to 1592 million  in fiscal 2017  certain items impacting fiscal 2018  were primarily expenses associated with our business technology transformation 

initiatives professional fees on threeyear financial objectives brakes integration costs and severance charges certain items impacting fiscal 2017  were primarily expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016 as a result of which we recorded accelerated depreciation of 1113 million  on our existing erp system and we incurred expenses of 112 million in fiscal 2017  to convert to a modernized version of our established platform 

corporate expenses in fiscal 2017  decreased 236 million  or 20  as compared to fiscal 2016  due primarily to lower payrelated expenses partially offset by an increase in our estimates for our reserves for our selfinsurance program which covers portions of workers’ compensation general and vehicle liability resulting from wage increases and unfavorable claims developments 

interest expense 

interest expense increased   926 million  in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  due to the partial redemption of senior notes and debentures due 2027 2028 2035 and 2039 pursuant to a tender offer in fiscal 2018 interest charges related to the redemption costs noted above are considered certain items excluding certain items our interest expense increased   395 million  in fiscal 2018  from fiscal 2017  due to higher borrowing levels attributable to senior notes issued in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  primarily to fund a 330 million pension contribution and to pay off our then outstanding commercial paper borrowings 

interest expense decreased   33 million  for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  due to certain item interest costs specific to fiscal 2016  partially offset by higher relative debt levels in fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  included a loss of 865 million  in connection with the redemption of the notes issued in fiscal 2015 to fund the merger that was proposed with us foods these items along with interest expense incurred in fiscal 2016  through the date the senior notes were redeemed and interest cost incurred from financing the brakes acquisition are included in our certain items excluding certain items our interest expense increased   1207 million  for fiscal 2017  from fiscal 2016  due to higher debt balances from senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2016  and commercial paper borrowings issued in fiscal 2017  

net earnings 

net earnings increased   252  in fiscal 2018  as compared to the prior year due primarily to the items noted above as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 18  “income taxes”  adjusted net earnings increased   221  in fiscal 2018  primarily due to strong local case growth gross margin expansion and reduced administrative expense partially offset by increased supply chain costs and interest expense which resulted in earnings growth that exceeded our operating income growth 

net earnings increased   203  in fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior year due primarily to the items noted above as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 18  “income taxes” adjusted net earnings increased   119  in fiscal 2017  primarily due to strong local case growth gross profit growth with margin expansion strong expense management and the results of sysco europe partially offset by increased interest expense which resulted in earnings growth that was lower than our operating income growth adjusted net earnings on a comparable 52week basis and excluding brakes increased   80  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2018  were 274  a 305   increase  from the comparable prior year amount of 210  per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018  were 270  a 298   increase  from the fiscal 2017  amount of 208  per share adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018  were 314  a 266   increase  from the fiscal 2017  amount of 248  per share these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our share repurchases in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2017  were 210  a 265   increase  from the comparable prior year amount of 166  per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017  were 208  a 268   increase  from the fiscal 2016  amount of 164  per share adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017  were 248  an 181   increase  from the fiscal 2016  amount of 210  per share adjusted diluted earnings per share on a comparable 52week basis and excluding brakes were 234  a 138   increase  from the fiscal 2016  amount of 206  per share these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our share repurchases in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  

nongaap reconciliations 

our discussion below and elsewhere herein of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016 as a result of which we incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform as opposed to completing the implementation of an erp 2 professional fees related to our threeyear strategic plans 3 restructuring expenses within our brakes group operations 4 severance charges related to restructuring and 5 foreign nonincome based taxes in addition fiscal 2018 results of operations are impacted by business technology transformation initiative costs facility closure charges mepp withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges which are also excluded from our nongaap financial measures 

the nongaap financial measures presented in this report also exclude the impact of the following acquisitionrelated items 1 intangible amortization expense and 2 integration costs all acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 that have been excluded relate to the brakes acquisition discussed in note 4  “acquisitions”  the brakes acquisition also resulted in nonrecurring tax expense in fiscal 2017 primarily from nondeductible transaction costs 

the nongaap financial measures presented in this report further exclude the impact of the tax act enacted on december 22 2017  the impact for fiscal 2018  includes a provisional estimate of a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a net benefit from remeasuring sysco’s accrued income taxes deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates other taxrelated items impacting results of operations include foreign withholding taxes on repatriated earnings net of foreign tax credits and a benefit from contributions made to fund sysco’s us retirement plan 

the fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  items described above and excluded from our nongaap measures are collectively referred to as “certain items” in addition with respect to the adjusted return on invested capital targets our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the brakes acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition 

management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income operating margin as a percentage of sales interest expense net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and facilitates comparisons on a yearoveryear basis and 2 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and which as a result are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30th this resulted in a 52 week year ending june 30 2018  for fiscal 2018  a 52 week year ending july 1 2017  for fiscal 2017  and a 53 week year ending july 2 2016  for fiscal 2016  because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2017 our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2017 and any related case growth metrics are not directly comparable to fiscal 2016 management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016 results for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis as a result the operating metrics for fiscal 2017 presented in the tables below reflect a comparison to fiscal 2016 as adjusted by onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter failure to make these adjustments causes the yearoveryear changes in these metrics to be understated 

although sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions the brakes group is significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by sysco with a proportionately greater impact on sysco’s consolidated financial statements accordingly sysco is also excluding from certain of its nongaap financial measures for the relevant periods solely those acquisition costs specific to the brakes acquisition we believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of sysco’s adjusted results for fiscal 2017 and 2016 as the brakes acquisition took place at the beginning of fiscal 2017 and given the significance of the brakes acquisition management believes that presenting sysco’s adjusted financial measures excluding the brakes group operating results including for this purpose brakes group financing costs which are not included in the brakes group operating results and are also not certain items enhances comparability of the period over period financial performance of sysco’s legacy business and allows investors to more effectively measure sysco’s results against the financial goals under sysco’s initial threeyear strategic plan that concluded in fiscal 2018 

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the table below each period presented is adjusted for the impact 

described above in the table below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding

sysco management considers adjusted roic to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the company’s longterm capital investments we calculate roic as net earnings divided by i stockholder’s equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year excluding the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and ii longterm debt computed as the average of the longterm debt at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year all components of our adjusted roic calculation would be impacted by certain items as a result we calculate adjusted roic as adjusted net earnings divided by i stockholders’ equity computed as the average of adjusted stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year and ii longterm debt computed as the average of the longterm debt at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year with respect to the adjusted return on invested capital targets our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the brakes acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition 



1 shareholders’ equity adjustments include the impact of certain items from earnings and removal of foreign currency adjustments that arose in the fiscal year 

in addition we have targets and expectations under our new threeyear plan that are based on adjusted results including an adjusted roic target of 16  we cannot predict with certainty when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of our roic in such future period will be on an adjusted basis due to the effect of certain items which would be excluded from such calculation due to these uncertainties to the extent our future calculation of roic is on an adjusted basis excluding certain items we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly comparable gaap measure without unreasonable effort however we would expect to calculate adjusted roic if applicable in the same manner as we have calculated this historically 

we have completed the final year of our initial threeyear plan that was established in fiscal 2016 and have measured our operating income performance against our targets on an adjusted basis the following reconciles gross profit operating expenses and operating income cumulative growth from an adjusted to a gaap basis 



 

due to uncertainties in projecting certain items during the period covered under our new threeyear strategic plan we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures without unreasonable effort however we would expect to calculate these adjusted results in the same manner as the reconciliations provided for the historical periods that are presented herein the impact of future certain items could cause projected nongaap amounts to differ significantly from our gaap results 

liquidity and capital resources 

highlights 

comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2018  to fiscal 2017  

 in addition for our senior notes 

 

sources and uses of cash 

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

 

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as credit monitoring optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations seasonal trends also impact our cash flows from operations and free cash 

flow as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases throughout the remainder of the year 

as of june 30 2018  we had 5523 million  in cash and cash equivalents approximately 680  of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to withholding and additional foreign tax obligations additionally sysco corporation has provided intercompany loans to certain of its international subsidiaries and when interest and principal payments are made some of this cash will move to the us 

upon the enactment of the tax act sysco’s undistributed foreign income of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries of approximately 14 billion  became subject to us transition tax as a result in the fourth quarter the company repatriated 10 billion  of foreign earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries and recognized foreign income and nonincome based taxes of 502 million  

in december 2017 sysco established a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive the primary purpose of the captive is to enhance sysco’s risk financing strategies by providing sysco the opportunity to negotiate insurance premiums in the nonretail insurance market the captive must maintain a sufficient level of cash to fund future reserve payments as of june 30 2018  we had 1635 million  of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents primarily held by the captive in a cash deposit account in order to meet solvency requirements 

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

 

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary 

cash flows 

operating activities 

fiscal 2018  vs fiscal 2017 

we generated 22 billion  in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2018  and in fiscal 2017  these comparable amounts include yearoveryear unfavorable comparisons on other long term liabilities and decreased working capital offset by favorable comparisons on accrued income taxes and higher operating results the cash impact of our certain items increased   518 million  yearoveryear the cash impact of certain items will differ from the earnings impact of certain items as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the certain item charges were recognized in the statement of consolidated results of operations 

included in the change in other longterm liabilities was a negative comparison primarily from pension contributions pension contributions were 4150 million  in fiscal 2018  including 3800 million  in contributions to our us retirement plan in fiscal 2018  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities pension contributions were 576 million  in fiscal 2017  including a 25 million  contribution to our us retirement plan which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities the level and timing of any contribution to our us retirement plan in fiscal 2019  is still being determined 

changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable and accounts payable had a negative impact of 2799 million  on the period over period comparison of cash flow from operations there was an unfavorable comparison on accounts payable and accounts receivable which was partially offset by favorable comparisons on inventory sales growth impacted all components of working capital however deflation contributed to lower levels of increase in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  

our tax payments in fiscal 2018  were lower than in fiscal 2017  due to the impacts of the tax act primarily due to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and the full expensing of qualified capital expenditures in addition cash taxes for fiscal 2018 were reduced due to the tax benefits derived from our 3800 million  in contributions to our us retirement plan additionally sysco’s fourth quarter us estimated federal tax payment for fiscal 2017  was deferred to the second quarter of fiscal 2018  due to a disaster area designation for companies located in the houston area the location of our corporate headquarters we made tax payments of approximately 2684 million  in fiscal 2018  we expect future tax payments to grow with our earnings 

fiscal 2017  vs fiscal 2016 

we generated 22 billion  in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2017  compared to cash flow generation of 20 billion  in fiscal 2016  this increase  of 2510 million  yearoveryear was largely attributable to higher operating results improved working capital management and a favorable comparison on accrued expenses and other longterm liabilities these were partially offset by an unfavorable comparison on accrued income taxes and deferred income taxes the cash impact of our certain items increased 1939 million  yearoveryear the cash impact of certain items will differ from the earnings impact of certain items as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the certain item charges were recognized in the statement of consolidated results of operations 

included in the change in other longterm liabilities was a positive comparison primarily from pension contributions pension contributions were 576 million  in fiscal 2017  including a 250 million  contribution to our us retirement plan in fiscal 2017  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities pension contributions were 1575 million  in fiscal 2016  including a 1300 million  contribution to the us retirement plan in fiscal 2016  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities 

changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable and accounts payable had a positive impact of 1661 million  on the period over period comparison of cash flow from operations primarily from improvements in accounts payable management this was partially offset by inventory sales growth impacted all components of working capital however deflation contributed to lower levels of increase in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  

the positive comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to 3125 million  in us foods merger termination fees that were paid in fiscal 2016  partially offset by a 394 million  decrease from incentive payments our annual incentive payments for performance in the prior fiscal year are paid in the first quarter of each succeeding fiscal year incentive payments paid in fiscal 2017  were higher than amounts paid in fiscal 2016  due to larger payouts achieved from fiscal 2016  performance 

our tax payments in fiscal 2016  were lower than in fiscal 2017  due to changes in tax elections allowing us to accelerate tax deductions from method changes which in turn significantly reduced our estimated payments in fiscal 2016  by delaying the timing of these payments to future periods additionally sysco’s fourth quarter us estimated federal tax payment for fiscal 2016  was deferred to the second quarter of fiscal 2017  due to a disaster area designation for companies located in the houston area the location of our corporate headquarters we made tax payments of approximately 7614 million  in fiscal 2017  including an approximate 120 million for the deferred tax payment from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  

investing activities 

fiscal 2018  capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2017  capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2016  capital expenditures included 

 

the level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2018   increased   14 million  as compared to fiscal 2017  capital expenditures in fiscal 2017   increased  by 1590 million  

we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2019  to be approximately 12  to 13  of fiscal sales fiscal 2019  expenditures will include facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions new facility construction and investments in technology 

during fiscal 2018  the company paid cash of 2481 million  for acquisitions net of cash acquired including hfm foodservice and doerle food services within us foodservice operations and kent frozen foods eko fågel fisk  mittemellan and the remaining 50 interest in our joint venture in costa rica within our international foodservice operations 

during fiscal 2017  the company paid cash of 29 billion  for acquisitions net of cash acquired including the brakes group and also acquired a small produce company in sweden 

during fiscal 2016  the company paid cash of 2192 million  for acquisitions including a leading luxury personal care amenity provider in the hospitality industry a distributor of highquality fresh and frozen seafood based in florida and an innovative ecommerce platform providing restaurant supplies and equipment exclusively to sysco customers during fiscal 2016  we paid 1035 million  and received 575 million  for options to hedge against the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the purchase price of the brakes acquisition 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions however free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments as a result of our contributions to our us retirement plan free cash flow for fiscal 2018   decreased   53  or 836 million  to 15 billion  as compared to fiscal 2017  our cash requirements for our certain items were 518 million  higher in fiscal 2018  than in fiscal 2017  as a result of increased cash provided by operating activities free cash flow for fiscal 2017   increased   62  or 922 million  to 16 billion  as compared to fiscal 2016  

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable gaap measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap in the table that follows free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 





financing activities 

equity transactions 

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 2688 million  in fiscal 2018  2048 million  in fiscal 2017  and 2825 million  in fiscal 2016  the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire 

we routinely engage in share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during fiscal 2018  were 17930114  shares for 9789 million  with 35744589  shares repurchased in fiscal 2017  for 19 billion  and 44716180  shares repurchased in fiscal 2016  for 19 billion  in february 2017 our board of directors approved a repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the company’s common stock not to exceed 10 billion  through the end of fiscal 2019 in november 2017 our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of the company’s common stock not to exceed 15 billion  through the end of fiscal 2020 all share repurchases in fiscal 2018  were made under the february 2017 authorization we repurchased approximately 1344000  additional shares for 936 million  through august 10 2018  these repurchase programs are intended to allow sysco to continue offsetting dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans and to make opportunistic repurchases the number of shares we repurchase during fiscal 2019  will be dependent on many factors including the level of future stock option exercises as well as competing uses for available cash we intend to continue purchasing shares under our current repurchase programs through open market purchases to align with our capital allocation strategy which will involve opportunistic purchases and purchases to offset dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans 

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our companys inception dividends paid were 7222 million  or 138  per share in fiscal 2018  6986 million  or  128  per share in fiscal 2017  and 6989 million  or 122  per share in fiscal 2016  in may 2018  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  of 036  per share which was paid in july 2018  we expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2019  

in august 2015 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer had the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities we intend to file a new universal shelf registration statement to replace our existing universal shelf registration statement in august 2018 the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 10 2018  29477835  shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

debt activity and borrowing availability 

our debt activity including issuances and repayments and our borrowing availability is described in note 11  “debt and other financing arrangements” our outstanding borrowings at june 30 2018  and repayment activity since the close of fiscal 2018  are disclosed within those notes updated amounts through august 10 2018  include 

 

our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 171  for fiscal 2018  097  for fiscal 2017  and 049  for fiscal 2016  

included in current maturities of longterm debt as of june 30 2018 are the 5375 senior notes totaling 250 million which mature in march 2019 and the 19 senior notes totaling 500 million which mature in april 2019 it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through cash on hand cash flow from operations issuances of commercial paper issuances of senior notes or a combination thereof 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of june 30 2018  certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 





85 million  for related interest that could result in cash payment we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time accordingly the related balances have not been reflected in the “payments due by period” section of the table 

 

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 30 2018 were 156 million  this amount is not included in the table above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the companysponsored pension plans income taxes goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our us retirement plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees our serp is frozen and is not open to any employees our uk pension plan the uk retirement plan is also frozen to new participants none of these plans have a significant sensitivity to changes in discount rates due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is not a critical assumption 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan decreased 25  basis points to 700  for fiscal 2018  the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on the us retirement plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 66  59  91  and 188  over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended us plan  respectively the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan is 500  for fiscal 2019  compared to 700  for fiscal 2018 investments in the portfolio have been reallocated to a higher portion of fixed income assets resulting in a lower expected longterm rate of return a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return in the plan for fiscal 2019  would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2018  by approximately 36 million  

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement 

of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 30 2018  was a charge net of tax of 11 billion  the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 1 2017  was a charge net of tax of 10 billion  

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

as discussed in note 18  “income taxes”  on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax act the tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code that effected the company’s fiscal year ending june 30 2018 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cut and jobs act  sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act see note 18  “income taxes”  for a description of sab 118 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values we use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we generally use the income method which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill more information on our acquisitions can be found in note 4  “acquisitions”  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

annually in our fourth quarter we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets impairment reviews outside our annual review time frame are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment however if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is performed 

when using a quantitative test we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit we generally use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant when reporting units represent recently acquired operations we generally use a higher weighting for our earnings multiple models than our discounted cash flow valuation as we believe this aligns with how acquired operations are valued in the market place the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working 

capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no  impairments of goodwill recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  in fiscal 2018 a 14 million writeoff for an intangible asset was recorded as it was no longer being used due to restructuring in france our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2017  and 2016  would not have been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2018  assessment the estimated fair values exceeded the carrying values for two international reporting units would have been applicable if our estimates of fair value were decreased by 15  and 18  respectively with goodwill of 3410 million  in the aggregate as of june 30 2018  recorded for these reporting units 

certain reporting units such as those noted above have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

sharebased compensation 

sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans a nonemployee director plan and the 2015 employee stock purchase plan espp 

as of june 30 2018  there was 1213 million  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 18 years  

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award and performance share unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units and performance share units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period expense recognized on performance share unit awards is subsequently adjusted based on forecasted performance compared to planned targets until the performance period concludes and the actual number of shares of sysco common stock to be received upon the vesting of the performance share units is known 

the fair value of the stock issued under the espp is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or nonemployee directors is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the espp is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

our sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risks consist of interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk fuel price risk and investment risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

at june 30 2018  there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding total debt as of june 30 2018  was 83 billion  of which approximately 74  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

at july 1 2017  there were 1197 million  commercial paper issuances outstanding total debt as of july 1 2017  was 82 billion  of which approximately 71  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

details of our outstanding swap agreements as of june 30 2018  are below 



we receive or pay amounts on these interest rate swap agreements on a semiannual basis 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of june 30 2018  all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 



 



rate a – threemonth libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our largest currency exposures are with canadian dollars british pound sterling and euro currencies our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries 

into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively  impacted sales by 10  in fiscal 2018  when compared to fiscal 2017  the exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively  impacted sales by 01  in fiscal 2017  when compared to fiscal 2016  the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017  a 10  unfavorable change in the fiscal 2018  weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2018  sales by 19  and would not have materially impacted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our investments and loans to our foreign operations created additional foreign currency exposure in fiscal 2017 we designated €500 million  of euro notes issued in june 2016 and various cross currency swaps as hedges of a portion of our net investment in eurodenominated and sterlingdenominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations changes in the value of these items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to us dollar exchange rates are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss in fiscal 2018  and in fiscal 2017 we entered into various cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of exchange rate changes for intercompany loans that are not in the functional currency of our subsidiaries these have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes recorded within foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 05  of sales during fiscal 2018  fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016 

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges that primarily track with the change in market prices of fuel we use diesel fuel swap contracts to fix the price of a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 30 2018  we had diesel fuel swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 46  million gallons through june 2019  these swaps will lock in the price of approximately 55  to 60  of our projected fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2019  our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10  unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 100 million  in our fuel costs on our noncontracted volumes 

investment risk 

our us retirement plan and uk retirement plan hold various investments including public and private equity fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10  unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plans at the plan’s fiscal year end  december 31 2017  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2019  however such an unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2019  by 306 million  and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 30 2018  by 3666 million  an unfavorable change in the fair value of our uk plan assets would not materially increase our fiscal 2019  pension expense and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 30 2018  by 259 million

acquisition of brakes group 

in february 2016 sysco entered into a share sale and purchase agreement the purchase agreement to acquire cucina lux investments limited the parent holding company of the brakes group the brakes acquisition on july 5 2016  following the end of fiscal year 2016 sysco closed the brakes acquisition the consideration paid by sysco in connection with the brakes acquisition was approximately £23 billion  approximately 31 billion  based on exchange rates on july 5 2016  and included the repayment of approximately 23 billion  of the brakes group’s then outstanding debt the purchase price was paid primarily in cash using the proceeds from recent debt issuances and other cash on hand and was subject to certain adjustments as provided in the purchase agreement the brakes group is now wholly owned by sysco

reporting segments 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise we have aggregated our operating segments into three reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

 

broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in note 21  business segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

customers and products 

sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served services to our customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

the products we distribute include 

 we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

 

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 



our distribution centers which we refer to as operating companies distribute branded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no  single customer accounted for 10  or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended july 1 2017  

we estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 



 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none  of which individually accounts for more than 10  of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers purchasing is generally carried out 

through both centrally developed purchasing programs domestically and internationally and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources” regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 45  days or more 

corporate headquarters and shared services center 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies and our shared services center performs support services for employees suppliers and customers members of these groups possess experience and expertise in among other areas customer and vendor contract administration accounting and finance treasury legal information technology payroll and employee benefits risk management and insurance sales and marketing human resources strategy and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  approximately 6864 million  5273 million   and 5428 million  respectively were invested in delivery fleet facilities technology and other capital asset enhancements from time to time we dispose of assets in the normal course of business we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets were 6627 million  5038 million  and 5184 million  respectively capital expenditures as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were 12  10  and 11  respectively we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2018  should be approximately 13  to 14  of sales during the three years ended july 1 2017  capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2018  capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

as of july 1 2017  we had approximately 66500  employees approximately 15  of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters and unions in france and sweden contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 14  of our union employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements have or will have expired contracts during fiscal 2018  which contracts are subject to renegotiation since july 1 2017  there have been 3 contract renegotiations we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

competition 

we believe there are a large number of companies engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry in the united states us our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores online retailers or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers online retailers and ecommerce companies are also participants in the foodservice industry while we compete primarily in the us with local and regional distributors some organizations compete with us on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently product needs service requirements and price are just a few of the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly there are few barriers to market entry existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers 

we estimate that we serve about 16  of an approximately 280 billion  annual foodservice market in the us based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2016  based on industry data obtained from technomic inc we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2017  while comprehensive industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our operations in the us and canada are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in those trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our marketing associates our diversified product base which includes qualityassured sysco brand products the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis and our multiregional presence in north america and europe which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time 

through our acquisition of the brakes group we are also a large distributor of food and nonfood products to the foodservice sector in europe our largest businesses in europe are in the uk france sweden and ireland and we also have a presence in belgium spain and luxembourg foodservice distribution is highly competitive in the different european countries across europe we face competition from other national broadline distributors as well as a large number of regional local and specialty distributors 

we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements there are a small number of companies competing in the foodawayfromhome industry in the us with publicly traded equity while our public company status provides us with some advantages over many of our competitors including access to capital we believe it also puts us at a disadvantage in that most of our competitors do not face the obligations and additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

government regulation 

our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business 

in the us as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda the fda regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and 

response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

the recently published and pending rules under the food safety modernization act fsma will significantly expand our food safety requirements among other things fda regulations implementing the fsma require us to establish and maintain comprehensive preventionbased controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated the fsma further imposes new requirements for food products imported into the us and provides the fda with mandatory recall authority in particular the final rule on the sanitary transportation of food which became effective for sysco in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 required us to enhance certain of our systems to ensure that we met the rule’s new standards for maintaining the safety of food during transportation 

we and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the fda biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the fda and usda our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal andor state authorities we also must establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute 

our customers include several departments of the federal government including the department of defense and department of veterans affairs facilities as well as certain state and local entities these customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors 

we are also subject to regulation by numerous federal state and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor which sets employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation as well as its agencies the surface transportation board the federal highway administration the federal motor carrier safety administration and the national highway traffic safety administration which collectively regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations safety insurance and hazardous materials we must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the federal motor carrier safety administration including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hoursof service such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations in addition we are subject to the us false claims act and similar state statutes which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized we have implemented and continue to develop a robust anticorruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anticorruption laws in countries where we operate 

our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate including the sherman antitrust act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the us these laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices boycotting competitors or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition in many jurisdictions compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions 

outside the us our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations as well as other legal and regulatory requirements for example as a result of our acquisition of the brakes group on july 5 2016 we became subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the principal regions where brakes conducts its business including in the uk ireland france and sweden the brakes principal regions as well as those of the european union which requirements relate to among other things competition product composition packaging labeling advertisement and the safety of food products as well as the health safety and working conditions of employees in addition following the acquisition of the brakes group our business became subject to the uk modern slavery act 2015 which requires certain companies that operate in the uk to prepare a report describing steps taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its supply chain or business as well as the uk bribery act 2010 an anticorruption law that restricts the offer or payment of anything of value to both government officials as well as to other nongovernmental persons with the intent of gaining favorable government action business or an advantage 

all of our companys facilities and other operations in the us and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those in the us the european union and the brakes principal regions relating to 1 the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater 2 the discharge of pollutants into the air including vehicle emissions 3 proper handling treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes and 4 protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases further most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks see “item1a risk factors  business and operational risks  we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance” 

general 

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco® and brakes® trademarks in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry in north america approximately half of our privately branded sales are from products labeled with our sysco® trademark without any other trademark we believe the loss of the sysco® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in europe approximately 25  of our privately branded european sales are from products labeled with the brakes® trademark both our us and european trademarks are effective for a tenyear period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use the company does not have any material patents or licenses 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

as of july 1 2017  we operated 324  distribution facilities throughout north america and europe 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and from historical trends 

industry and general economic risks 

periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of significant product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our results of operations to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may negatively impact our business due to the timing needed to pass on such increases the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive environment conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our results of operations may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in the us canada and europe as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the foodservice distribution industry which is characterized by relatively low profit margins with limited demand growth expected in the nearterm is especially susceptible to negative trends and economic uncertainty north america and europe have each experienced an uneven economic environment over the past several years in addition our results of operations are substantially affected by regional operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

 

we believe that uncertainty in the economic environment over the past several years has adversely affected the rate of improvement in both business and consumer confidence and spending and uncertainty about the longterm investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity in the future 

economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the uk’s exit from the european union could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the uk’s anticipated exit from the european union the eu and the resulting significant change to the uk’s relationship with the eu and with countries outside the eu and its laws and regulations impacting business conducted between them could disrupt the overall stability of the uk and the eu given the diverse economic and political circumstances of the uk and individual eu countries and otherwise negatively impact our european operations including the brakes group if changes occur in laws and regulations impacting the flow of goods services and workers between the uk and the eu our european operations could also be negatively impacted the completion of the uk’s exit from the eu could have less severe but still significant implications such exit could adversely affect the value of our euro and pounddenominated assets and obligations exchange rates related to the british pound sterling have been more volatile since the uk announced it would exit the eu and such volatility may continue in the future future fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the local currencies of our suppliers may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the uk which increases we may not be able to pass on to our customers in addition the uk’s exit from the eu could cause financial and capital markets within and outside the eu to constrict thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business and also could cause a substantial dip in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively impact the foodservice distribution industry any one of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers and makes it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional multiregional distributors and specialty competitors local and regional companies often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups with the goal of enhancing their geographic reach private label offerings overall purchasing power cost efficiencies and ability to meet customer distribution requirements these suppliers may also rely on local presence as a source of competitive advantage and they may have lower costs and other competitive advantages due to geographic proximity furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures cash and carry operations and group purchasing organizations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we are also experiencing growing competition from online direct food wholesalers finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or 

may require increased discounting or other concessions such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our results of operations could be adversely impacted in addition even if we are able to effectively differentiate ourselves we may only be able to do so through increased expenditures or decreased prices which could also adversely impact our results of operations 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the   costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future if fuel costs increase in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our results of operations 

we routinely enter into fuel hedging arrangements including fuel derivatives to hedge our exposure to volatile fuel prices there can be no assurance that our fuel hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices and if fuel prices decrease significantly these hedging arrangements would result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel in addition our future use of fuel derivatives would expose us to the risk that one of our counterparties fails to perform its obligations whether due to its insolvency or otherwise which could result in financial losses 

business and operational risks 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages animal disease outbreaks transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands terrorist attacks or international hostilities and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

in addition as a foodservice distributor it is necessary for us to maintain an inventory of products and declines in product pricing levels between the time we purchase the product from our suppliers and the time we sell the product to our customers could reduce our margin on that inventory adversely affecting our results of operations 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business sysco’s brand names trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to illegal or unethical activities by our employees suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations 

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis salmonella listeria or swine flu or injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact public confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses 

our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our results of operations to decrease dramatically 

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and   services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our relationships with longterm customers may be materially diminished or terminated 

we have longstanding relationships with a number of our customers many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time market competition customer requirements customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers our customer agreements are generally terminable upon advance written notice typically ranging from 30 days to six months by either us or the customer which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us on less favorable terms or to award more business to our competitors the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable changes to the mix of locally managed customers versus multiunit customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

increasing the volume of our sales to locally managed customers is very important for our business and our results of operations gross margin from our multiunit customers is generally lower than that of our locally managed customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locally managed customers if sales to our locally managed customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our multiunit customers our operating margins may decline 

moreover if sales to our multiunit customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locallymanaged customers we will become more dependent on multiunit customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales additionally the loss of sales to the larger of these multiunit customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers we could be pressured by them to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event if we were unable to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases our results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

changes in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in consumer eating habits such as a decline in consuming food away from home a decline in portion sizes or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers could reduce demand for our products consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods there is a growing consumer preference for sustainable organic and locally grown products and a shift towards plantbased proteins andor animal proteins derived from animals that were humanely treated and antibiotic free changing consumer eating habits also occur due to generational shifts millennials the largest demographic group in terms of spend seek new and different as well as more ethnic menu options and menu innovation if consumer eating habits change significantly we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio and we may experience higher costs andor supply shortages associated with our efforts to accommodate those changes as our suppliers adapt to the new eating preferences changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home additionally changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment or 

amendment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products compliance with these laws and regulations as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products may be costly and timeconsuming we cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits 

we may not be able to achieve our threeyear financial targets by the end of fiscal year 2018 

in fiscal 2016 we set new threeyear financial targets to grow operating income accelerate earnings per share growth faster than operating income growth and improve return on invested capital our ability to meet these financial targets depends largely on our successful execution of our business plan including various related initiatives there are various risks related to these efforts including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame if at all and may prove costlier than expected and the risk of adverse effects to our business results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings and the associated changes to our business do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate our intentions and expectations with regard to the execution of our business plan and the timing of any related initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs if we are unable to successfully execute our business plan whether due to our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from our various business initiatives in the anticipated time frame or otherwise we may be unable to achieve our threeyear financial targets 

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful  

as demonstrated by our acquisition of the brakes group an element of our strategy includes further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political economic and social conditions beyond our control local laws and customs and legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with applicable anticorruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on the financial results of our international operations 

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 

as a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example the us and many countries in the eu where we do business are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals in particular reforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for us politicians and key members of the legislative and executive branches have proposed a wide variety of potential changes some of which could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination could change if tax laws or tax rulings were to be modified we are also subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are appropriate there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 

if the products distributed by us are alleged to have caused injury or illness or to have failed to comply with governmental regulations we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims 

we like any other foodservice distributor may be subject to product recalls including voluntary recalls or withdrawals if the products we distribute are alleged to have caused injury or illness to have been mislabeled misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise have violated applicable governmental regulations we may also choose to voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we determine do not satisfy our quality standards whether for taste appearance or otherwise in order to protect our brand and reputation any future product recall or withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures destruction of product inventory damage to our reputation andor lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we also face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco are alleged to have caused injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business  

we are subject to regulation by various federal state provincial regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate with respect to many aspects of our business such as food safety and sanitation ethical business practices transportation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs for a detailed discussion of the laws and regulations to which our business is subject please refer to “business  government regulation” in part i item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting or seizures or debarments from contracting with such government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to substantial fines penalties or thirdparty claims for noncompliance 

our operations are subject to various federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the various countries in which we operate relating to the protection of the environment including those governing 



in the course of our operations we operate maintain and fuel fleet vehicles store fuel in onsite above and underground storage tanks operate refrigeration systems and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes we could incur substantial costs including fines or penalties and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment in addition we could incur investigation remediation or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties 

for example most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks certain of these laws and regulations in the european union and the brakes principal regions may impose liability for costs which could be material of investigation or remediation of contamination regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal and even if such contamination was present prior to the commencement of brakes’ operations at the site and was not caused by its activities in addition many of our facilities have propane and battery powered forklifts proposed or recently enacted legal requirements such as those requiring the phaseout of certain ozonedepleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may require us to upgrade or replace equipment or may increase our transportation or other operating costs 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments in addition our failure to implement effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures with respect to a significant acquired business such as the brakes group could result in material weaknesses andor a failure to file our periodic reports with the sec on a timely basis 

we need access to borrowed funds to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

as described in note 11  debt and other financing arrangements  as of july 1 2017  we had approximately 82 billion  of total indebtedness which included a commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 20 billion  a revolving credit facility supporting our us commercial paper program in the amount of 20 billion  scheduled to expire on november 2 2021  and various other smaller bank facilities 

our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for us including 

 

our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures potential acquisitions joint ventures andor share repurchase programs our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of future debt financing and financial results and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional 

indebtedness in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

we rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations and our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology systems we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases to manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis we also use mobile devices social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and customers further our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers’ personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and our business partners 

these technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to disruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire natural disasters power outages systems failures security breaches espionage cyberattacks viruses theft and inadvertent release of information any such disruption to these software and other technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely the failure of these systems to otherwise perform as anticipated or the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage any or all of which would potentially adversely affect our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits 

further as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure we are also expanding and improving our information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks 

while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and other measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents as well as disaster recovery plans these initiatives and measures may not be entirely effective to insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our results of operations additionally information technology systems continue to evolve and in order to remain competitive we must implement new technologies in a timely and efficient manner if our competitors implement new technologies more quickly or successfully than we do such competitors may be able to provide lower cost or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 13  of our current us employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2017  our total contributions to these plans were approximately 446 million  and in may 2017 a sysco subsidiary voluntarily withdrew from a multiemployer pension plan and recorded a 356 million  withdrawal liability the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan we could also be treated as partially withdrawing from participation in one of these plans if the number of our employees participating in a given plan is reduced to a certain degree over a certain period of time such reductions in the number of employees participating in these plans could occur as a result of changes in our business operations such as facility closures or consolidations based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 1479 million  as of july 1 2017  a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

at the end of fiscal 2012  we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan as of december 31 2012  for all us based salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013  these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 42 billion  as of july 1 2017  therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements although recent pension funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions that provided the relief are phased out see note 14  companysponsored employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the retirement plan 

the amount of our annual contribution to the retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability our retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse effect on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

as of july 1 2017  approximately 9813 employees at 55  operating companies were members of 53  different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations moreover labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized which could increase our labor costs in fiscal 2018  12 agreements covering approximately 1367 employees have expired or will expire failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our employee recruitment development and retention efforts may not be successful resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016  as a result of which we recorded accelerated depreciation on our thenexisting system and incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform 2 professional fees related to our threeyear strategic plan 3 restructuring expenses within our brakes group operations and 4 severance charges related to restructuring our results of operations are also impacted by the following acquisitionrelated items 1 intangible amortization expense 2 transaction costs and 3 integration costs all acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2017 that have been excluded relate to the brakes group acquisition the brakes acquisition sysco’s results of operations are also impacted by multiemployer pension mepp withdrawal charges fiscal 2016 acquisitionrelated costs however include i brakes acquisition related costs ii 

termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods inc us foods and iii financing costs related to the senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2015  to fund the proposed us foods merger these senior notes were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  triggering a redemption loss of 865 million  and we incurred interest on these notes through the redemption date the brakes acquisition also resulted in nonrecurring tax expense in fiscal 2017  primarily from nondeductible transaction costs additionally our results of operations were impacted by multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs in fiscal 2017  these fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  items are collectively referred to as certain items and they have been excluded from our nongaap financial measures with respect to the adjusted return on invested capital targets our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the brakes acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30 th  this resulted in a 52 week year ending july 1 2017  for fiscal 2017  a 53 week year ending july 2 2016  for fiscal 2016  and a 52 week year ending june 27 2015  for fiscal 2015  because fiscal 2017  contained one fewer week as compared to fiscal 2016  our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2017  are not directly comparable to the prior year management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016  consolidated results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis sysco’s results of operations and related metrics within this section will be disclosed on both a 52 week and 53 week basis for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  this is calculated by deducting onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  

any metric within this section referred to as “adjusted” will reflect the applicable impact of both certain items and the extra week in fiscal 2016  more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located in north america and europe the company has aggregated certain of its operating segments into three  reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 

 

broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 

we estimate that we serve approximately 16 of the 280 billion annual foodservice market in the united states us based on industry data obtained from technomic inc from time to time technomic may revise the methodology used to calculate the size of the foodservice market and as a result our percentage can change not only from our sales results but also from such revisions we also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share 

according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 51 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar 2016 industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the us experienced a real sales increase of approximately 14 in calendar year 2016 and 23 in calendar year 2015 real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

acquisition of brakes group 

on july 5 2016  sysco consummated its acquisition of cucina lux investments limited a private company limited by shares organized under the laws of england and wales a holding company of the brakes group pursuant to an agreement for the sale and purchase of securities in the capital of the brakes group dated as of february 19 2016  the purchase agreement 

by and among sysco entities affiliated with bain capital investors llc and members of management of the brakes group following the closing of the brakes acquisition the brakes group became a wholly owned subsidiary of sysco 

the brakes group is a large european foodservice business supplying fresh refrigerated and frozen food products as well as nonfood products and supplies to foodservice customers the brakes group’s largest businesses are in the united kingdom uk france and sweden in addition to a presence in ireland belgium spain and luxembourg the brakes acquisition significantly strengthens sysco’s position as the global leader in selling marketing and distributing food products and offers attractive opportunities for organic growth and future expansion in european markets 

highlights and trends 

comparison of results from fiscal 2017  to fiscal 2016  

 see “nongaap reconciliations” for an explanation of these nongaap financial measures 

the general foodservice market environment since the beginning of fiscal 2017  has reflected a modestly growing us economy disparate regional economic conditions in canada and mixed economic backdrops in the uk ireland france and sweden while we continue to transition some large contract customers in our us foodservice operations our case growth with local customers in that business segment improved during the second half of the year favorable consumer confidence throughout much of the us contributed to restaurant check size increases even though yearoveryear traffic trends were unfavorable in certain customer segments throughout fiscal 2017  we provided our customers with excellent service delivered case growth through a focus on local customers improved our gross profit dollars and effectively managed overall expenses these are all important steps towards achieving our threeyear plan financial objectives we also completed the brakes acquisition which added positively to our results 

our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price volume and product mix the modest level of growth in the foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures which can impact our profitability the majority of our sales are to locally managed customers and multiunit customers our locally managed customers including independent restaurant customers comprise a greater percentage of our profitability as compared to multiunit customers case growth with our locally managed broadline business is important to drive gross profit dollar growth our sales to multiunit customers including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes gross margin on sales to our multiunit customers is generally lower than on sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these customers in fiscal 2017 we grew our cases with local customers however case growth for our multiunit customers declined due in part to our efforts to deliver disciplined profitable growth we will continue to focus on local customer growth by providing value through innovative product offerings and valueadded services along with improved ecommerce capabilities we also expect case growth trends for multiunit customers to begin to improve as we progress through fiscal 2018 we offer an assortment of syscobranded products that we can differentiate from privately branded products which enables us to achieve higher gross profits as a result we focus on sales growth for these products especially with locally managed customers inflation is a factor that contributes to the level of sales and gross profit growth and can be a factor that contributes 

to gross margin pressure we experienced deflation at a rate of 06  for fiscal 2017  deflation in fiscal 2017  occurred primarily in the meat dairy and produce categories partially offset by modest inflation in other categories we saw modest overall inflation during the last quarter of the year driven by poultry produce dairy and seafood categories we expect inflation to continue for the balance of calendar 2017  periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have an unfavorable effect on us and our customers as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers 

we have experienced higher operating expenses in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  that are attributable to higher case volumes and the addition of the brakes group while these costs are increasing certain of our expenses declined including fuel costs attributable to lower fuel prices in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 we expect operating expenses to increase in fiscal 2018 primarily driven by anticipated growth in case volume we also expect transportation costs to increase due to higher fuel prices we intend to make increased investments in the sales team which will drive local case growth we have also incurred certain items in fiscal 2017  for restructuring costs currently consisting of the impact of changes to our business technology strategy restructuring expenses within our brakes group operations professional fees incurred related to our threeyear strategic plan and severance charges additionally we incurred costs associated with a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in fiscal 2017 

during the year brakes performed reasonably well amidst a challenging environment in the uk exceeding our expectations for earnings per share accretion by contributing 009  per share for fiscal 2017  on an adjusted basis our brakes group operations contributed approximately 014  per share to our adjusted consolidated earnings per share for fiscal 2017  the brakes group is progressing in its supply chain transformational efforts as it moves to multitemperature capability across the uk growth in france remains steady additionally we continue to see long term opportunities for growth across our new european business see “nongaap reconciliations” for an explanation of these nongaap financial measures 

strategy 

we are focused on optimizing our core foodservice business through our customer centric strategy with a “one sysco” approach that is being executed at a high level and that positions us to deliver disciplined profitable and sustainable growth moving forward we aspire to be the most valued and trusted business partner for all of our customers and are committed to delivering on our targeted financial objectives for sysco’s shareholders we will continue to develop and refine current key strategic initiatives such as category management revenue management enhanced customer facing technology and multiple productivity improvement measures in our ongoing effort to create competitive advantage we will do this by deepening our customer insight work continually enhancing our technology capabilities and by attracting and developing highly capable and increasingly diverse leaders and associates we have identified five components of our strategy to help us achieve our mission and vision as follows 



we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions joint ventures and sales of assets and businesses 

in fiscal 2016 we set threeyear financial targets to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2018 

 

because our original targets were set without the contemplation of the brakes acquisition our brakes group operations are not included in our adjusted operating income improvement or earnings per share goals 

the key strategic levers of our threeyear plan include delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers growing gross profit dollars and managing overall expenses our strategic focus on accelerating growth with local customers utilizes an insightsbased customercentric approach that permeates everything we do we have improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training technology and targeted specialized resources and as a result our marketing associates are spending more time working with our customers on valueadded activities and consultative services such as menu analysis inventory management and business reviews these services foster a deeper relationship with our customers and further enforces the role that the sales force plays in helping our customers succeed we have seen improvements in our return on invested capital as net working capital performance continues to improve driven by improvements in payables receivables and inventory 

during fiscal 2017  we delivered the following results against these objectives as compared to fiscal 2016  

 

over this twoyear period since establishing our threeyear financial targets we have grown our operating income by 8238 million and our adjusted operating income by 4169 million the difference between our reported amount and adjusted amount includes the impact of the brakes acquisition additionally our operating income goal was established on an adjusted basis given certain item charges that were applicable in fiscal 2015 which were primarily due to termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods and financing costs related to the senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2015 to fund the proposed us foods merger we expect to continue to drive leverage between gross profit growth and expense growth and believe that we will achieve the high end of our 600 million  to 650 million  adjusted operating income goal

results   of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 



the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the comparable period in the prior year 



  

 

segment results 

we have aggregated certain of our operating segments into three reportable segments “other” financial information is attributable to the company’s other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds 



broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and sysco’s shared services center these also include all sharebased compensation costs while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the shortterm by increases or decreases in gross profits expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

the following represents our results by reportable segments and also demonstrates the impact of the brakes groups results on our international foodservice operations segment 







nm represent that the percentage change is not meaningful 

based on information in note 21  business segment information  in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations represented approximately 679  and 192  respectively of sysco’s overall sales in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  us foodservice operations and international foodservice operations collectively represented approximately 910  and 76  respectively of the total segment operating income this illustrates that these segments represent a substantial majority of our total segment results when compared to other reportable segments 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 

results of us foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2017  the us foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 679  of sysco’s overall sales and 910  of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s reporting segments there are several factors that contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power enable this segment to generate its relatively stronger results of operations 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 





sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the prior year in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



 

sales were 05  lower in fiscal 2017  than in fiscal 2016  the largest driver of the 05  decrease was the extra week in fiscal 2016  which we estimate contributed 08 of the sales decline in fiscal 2017  case volumes for the company’s us broadline operations including acquisitions within the last 12 months declined 10  in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  we estimate that the extra week contributed 20  of the 10  case decline absent the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016  case volume grew primarily from locally managed customers other items impacting the change in sales but to a lesser extent were pricing management of product cost deflation and product mix 



 

sales for fiscal 2016  were 46  higher than fiscal 2015  the largest drivers of the increases were case volume growth an extra week in fiscal 2016 and sales from acquisitions that occurred within fiscal 2016  

operating income 

operating income increased by 43  in fiscal 2017  over fiscal 2016  primarily due to our gross profits growing at a faster pace than operating expenses higher gross profits were achieved as we managed the deflationary environment in the first part of the year and operating expense increases were limited reflecting favorable expense management we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 partially offset by 20  the yearoveryear operating income growth 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to effective management of deflation a more beneficial mix of local customer case growth and increased sales of sysco branded products to local customers our case growth for sysco branded sales to local customers increased 62 basis points for fiscal 2017  the change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation was estimated as deflation of 04  during fiscal 2017  for our us broadline operations deflation in fiscal 2017  occurred primarily in the meat dairy and produce categories partially offset by modest inflation in other categories 

operating expenses increased in 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to costs associated with multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs in fiscal 2017  and indirect spend these increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 reduced fuel costs and payrelated expenses indirect spend includes costs such as fleet maintenance and 

supplies for our us broadline operations our cost per case and adjusted cost per case increased 002  per case and decreased 001  per case respectively in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  the decrease on an adjusted basis reflects improved productivity in the warehouse and execution of our functional standard organizational design including a solid territory planning effort in sales the portion of the decrease attributable to lower fuel prices was a 002  benefit per case additionally the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 was not large enough to produce a different result on a 52week basis 

operating income increased by 112  in fiscal 2016  over fiscal 2015  primarily due to the extra week in fiscal 2016  and higher gross profits partially offset by higher operating expenses attributable to higher case volumes we estimate that the extra week contributed 23  of the 112  operating income growth our gross profit grew at a faster pace than operating expenses reflecting favorable expense management 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to the extra week in fiscal 2016 sales volumes including a more beneficial mix of local customer case growth higher sales of sysco branded products to local customers benefits of category management and revenue management and effective management of deflation our focus on center of plate categories such as beef pork and poultry and our emphasis on fresh produce helped drive gross profit growth our case growth for sysco brand sales to local customers increased 82  basis points for fiscal 2016  the change in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation was estimated as deflation of 09  during fiscal 2016  for our us broadline operations deflation in fiscal 2016  occurred primarily in the meat seafood dairy and poultry categories for both periods partially offset by modest inflation in other categories 

operating expenses increased in 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to the extra week in fiscal 2016  and expenses attributable to higher case volumes these increases were partially offset by reduced indirect spend and fuel costs and administrative expense indirect spend includes costs such as fleet maintenance and supplies for our us broadline operations our cost per case and adjusted cost per case decreased 004  per case in fiscal 2016  as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2015  the decrease reflects progress in productivity improvements and cost reductions in our supply chain including reduced fuel costs and indirect spend the decrease attributable to lower fuel prices was a 004  benefit per case adjustments to operating expenses were not large enough to produce a different result on an adjusted cost per case basis for fiscal 2016  additionally the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016  was not large enough to produce a different result on a 52week basis 

results of international foodservice operations 

in fiscal 2017  the international foodservice operations operating results represented approximately 192  of sysco’s overall sales and 76  of the aggregated operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments 

the following tables set forth a summary of the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 





sales 

the following table sets forth the percentage and dollar value increase or decrease in sales over the comparable prior year period in order to demonstrate the cause and magnitude of change 



 

sales were 952  higher in fiscal 2017  than in fiscal 2016  the increase for fiscal 2017  was primarily due to the acquisition of the brakes group which added 52 billion  during the year the increase was partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 a small decline in case volume primarily in canada and unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars we had a modest decrease in sales in canada due to softer market conditions 



sales were 28  lower in fiscal 2016  than in fiscal 2015  the decrease for fiscal 2016  was primarily due to unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars partially offset by the extra week within fiscal 2016  the consolidation of our joint venture in mexico in the last half of fiscal 2016  also partially offset lower sales 

operating income 

operating income increased by 372  in fiscal 2017  from fiscal 2016  primarily attributable to the brakes acquisition the brakes group is progressing in its supply chain transformational efforts as it moves to multitemperature capability across the uk growth in france remains steady excluding the brakes group nongaap operating income adjusted for the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 increased 117  in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily from managing costs effectively in canada within a deflationary and somewhat softer market environment our joint venture in costa rica also experienced improved operating income performance 

gross profit dollars increased 13 billion  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to the brakes acquisition adjusted gross profit dollars excluding the impact of brakes and on a comparable 52 week basis increased 24  adjusted gross profit dollar growth was higher due to improved sales execution and implementation of our customer focused initiatives such as category management and revenue management in our canadian operations 

operating expenses increased 13 billion  in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  largely due to the brakes acquisition adjusted operating expenses excluding brakes were flat in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  as a result of our effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity in the canadian business 

operating income increased by 37  in fiscal 2016  from fiscal 2015  primarily driven by improved operating performance in addition to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016  

gross profit dollars decreased 31  while operating expenses decreased 46  in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  gross profit dollar growth was higher due to stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed customers and case growth primarily in our canadian operations however these improvements were more than offset by unfavorable changes in exchange rates used to translate our gross profit into us dollars 

operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2016  largely due to reduced general and administrative costs in our canadian operations in addition to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates used to translate our operating expenses into us dollars

interest expense increased 513 million  for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to the redemption of the senior notes issued in fiscal 2015  to fund the merger that had been proposed with us foods these senior notes were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  and triggered a redemption loss of 865 million  this increase was partially offset by lower average debt levels in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  we incurred interest costs from financing the brakes acquisition in the last half of fiscal 2016  in fiscal 2015  we incurred interest costs related to the proposed merger with us foods interest costs related to these proposed acquisitions as well as the redemption costs noted above are considered certain items our interest expense excluding certain items increased 618 million  as compared to fiscal 2015  due to higher borrowing levels from senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2016  primarily for our accelerated share repurchase program 

net earnings 

net earnings increased   203  in fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior year due primarily to the items noted above as well as items impacting our income taxes that are discussed in note 19  income taxes   adjusted net earnings increased   119  in   fiscal 2017  primarily due to strong local case growth gross profit growth with margin expansion strong expense management and the results of the brakes group partially offset by increased interest expense which resulted in earnings growth that was lower than our operating income growth adjusted net earnings on a comparable 52week basis and excluding brakes increased 80  in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 

net earnings increased 383  in fiscal 2016  from fiscal 2015  due primarily to the items noted above and the beneficial impact from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies items impacting our income taxes from effective tax rates are discussed in note 19  income taxes   adjusted net earnings increased 80  in fiscal 2016  primarily from gross profit growth strong expense management and the favorable resolutions of tax contingencies an additional unfavorable impact on our net earnings and adjusted net earnings resulted from the strengthening us dollar which reduced both amounts by 115 million  for fiscal 2016  as we converted foreign earnings to us dollars 

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2017  were 210  a 265  increase from the comparable prior year amount of 166  per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017  were 208  a 268  increase from the fiscal 2016  amount of 164  per share adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017  were 248  an 181  increase from the fiscal 2016  amount of 210  per share adjusted diluted earnings per share on a comparable 52week basis and excluding brakes were 234  a 136  increase from the fiscal 2016 amount of 206  per share these results were primarily attributable to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our share repurchases in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2016  were 166  a 431   increase  from the fiscal 2015  amount of 116  per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016  were 164  a 426   increase  from the fiscal 2015  amount of 115  adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016  were 206  a 120  increase from the fiscal 2015  amount of 184  these results were primarily due to the factors discussed above related to net earnings and a decrease in outstanding shares that resulted from our accelerated share repurchase program 

nongaap reconciliations 

sysco’s consolidated results of operations are impacted by restructuring costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016 as a result of which we recorded accelerated depreciation on our prior erp system and incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform 2 professional fees related to our threeyear strategic plan 3 restructuring expenses within our brakes group operations and 4 severance charges related to restructuring our results of operations are also impacted by the following acquisitionrelated items 1 intangible amortization expense 2 transaction costs and 3 integration costs all acquisitionrelated costs in fiscal 2017  that have been excluded relate to the brakes acquisition additionally our results of operations were impacted by multiemployer pension plan withdrawal costs in fiscal 2017  fiscal 2016  acquisitionrelated costs however include i brakes acquisition related costs ii termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods inc us foods and iii financing costs related to the senior notes that were issued in fiscal 2015 to fund the proposed us foods merger these senior notes were redeemed in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 triggering a redemption loss of 865 million  and we incurred interest on these notes through the redemption date the brakes acquisition also resulted in nonrecurring tax expense in fiscal 2017 primarily from nondeductible transaction costs these fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  items are collectively referred to as certain items 

management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income operating margin as a percentage of sales interest expense net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the companys underlying operations and facilitates comparisons on a yearoveryear basis and 2 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and which as a result are difficult to include in analysts financial models and our investors expectations with any degree of specificity sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30th this resulted in a 52week year ending june 27 2017 for fiscal 2017 and a 53week year ending july 2 2016 for fiscal 2016 because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2017 our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2017 and any related case growth metrics are not directly comparable to the prior year management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016 results for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis as a result the case growth and operating metrics for fiscal 2017 presented in the tables below reflect a comparison to fiscal 2016 as adjusted by onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter failure to make these adjustments causes the yearoveryear changes in these metrics to be understated 

although sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions the brakes group is significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by sysco with a proportionately greater impact on sysco’s consolidated financial statements accordingly sysco is also excluding from certain of its nongaap financial measures for the relevant periods solely those acquisition costs specific to the brakes acquisition we believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of sysco’s adjusted results for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  as the brakes acquisition took place at the beginning of fiscal 2017 and given the significance of the brakes acquisition management believes that presenting sysco’s adjusted financial measures excluding the brakes group operating results including for this purpose brakes group financing costs which are not included in the brakes group gaap 

operating results and are also not certain items enhances comparability of the period over period financial performance of sysco’s legacy business and allows investors to more effectively measure sysco’s progress against the financial goals under sysco’s threeyear strategic plan 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30 th  this resulted in a 52 week year ending july 1 2017  for fiscal 2017  and a 53 week year ending july 2 2016  for fiscal 2016  because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2017  our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2017  are not directly comparable to the prior year management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2016  consolidated results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis as a result the metrics from the consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016  presented in the table below are adjusted by onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter failure to make these adjustments causes the yearoveryear changes in certain metrics such as sales operating expenses operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be understated whereas in certain cases a metric may actually have increased on a more comparable yearoveryear basis 

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the table below each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above in the table below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding

case growth 

case growth is impacted by the extra week in fiscal 2016 this amount is adjusted out of case growth measures to remove the extra week for comparability purposes for the same underlying reasons the extra week is excluded from the measures presented above the table that follows provides a reconciliation of case growth to remove the impact of the extra week 



adjusted cost per case 

cost per case is an important metric management uses to measure our expense performance this metric is calculated by dividing the total operating expense of our us broadline companies by the number of cases sold adjusted cost per case is calculated similarly however the operating expense component excludes certain items applicable to these companies prior to dividing by the number of cases sold in fiscal 2017 the us broadline operations represented approximately 92 of the us foodservice operations segment’s sales and nearly 84 of its operating expenses we seek to grow our sales and reduce our costs on a percase basis 

in the table that follows the change in adjusted cost per case is reconciled to costs per case for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 



threeyear financial targets 

sysco management considers adjusted roic to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the companys longterm capital investments in addition we have targets and expectations that are based on adjusted results including an adjusted roic target of 15  we cannot predict with certainty when we will achieve these results or whether the calculation of our roic in such future period will be on an adjusted basis due to the effect of certain items which would be excluded from such calculation due to these uncertainties to the extent our future calculation of roic is on an adjusted basis excluding certain items we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of this nongaap measure to the most directly comparable gaap measure without unreasonable effort however we would expect to calculate adjusted roic if applicable in the same manner as we have calculated this historically all components of our adjusted roic calculation would be impacted by certain items we calculate adjusted roic as adjusted net earnings divided by i stockholders’ equity computed as the average of adjusted stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year and ii longterm debt computed as the average of the longterm debt at the beginning of the year and at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year 



we are two years into the threeyear period under our strategic plan and are measuring our operating income performance against our targets on an adjusted basis the following reconciles operating income cumulative growth from an adjusted to a gaap basis 





 

due to uncertainties in projecting certain items we cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation of these nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures without unreasonable effort however we would expect to calculate these adjusted results in the same manner as the reconciliations provided for the historical periods that are presented herein the impact of future certain items could cause projected nongaap amounts to differ significantly from our gaap results 

liquidity and capital resources 

highlights 

comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2017  to fiscal 2016  

 in addition for our senior notes 

 

sources and uses of cash 

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

 

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations we 

believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as credit monitoring optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations seasonal trends also impact our cash flows from operations and free cash flow as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases throughout the remainder of the year as of july 1 2017  we had 8695 million  in cash and cash equivalents approximately 790  of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations however we do not currently anticipate the need to repatriate this cash 

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

 

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary 

cash flows 

operating activities 

fiscal 2017  vs fiscal 2016 

we generated 22 billion  in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2017  compared to cash flow generation of 19 billion  in fiscal 2016  this increase  of 2433 million  yearoveryear was largely attributable to higher operating results improved working capital management and a favorable comparison on accrued expenses and other longterm liabilities these were partially offset by an unfavorable comparison on accrued income taxes and deferred income taxes the cash impact of our certain items decreased   1939 million  yearoveryear the cash impact of certain items will differ from the earnings impact of certain items as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the certain item charges were recognized in the statement of consolidated results of operations 

the statement of cash flows included within this annual report reflects the correction of misclassifications from the statement of cash flows included in the earnings release furnished with our current report on form 8k filed on august 14 2017 specifically in comparing the cash flow statement to the unaudited statement provided in our form 8k filed on august 14 2017 “net cash provided by operating activities” decreased by 655 million “net cash used in financing activities” increased 134 million and “effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents” decreased by 789 million additionally a reclassification between goodwill intangible assets and deferred taxes was made in the fiscal 2017 consolidated balance sheet goodwill increased by 264 million intangible assets decreased by 318 million and deferred tax liabilities decreased by 53 million 

changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable and accounts payable had a positive impact of 1661 million  on the period over period comparison of cash flow from operations primarily from improvements in accounts payable management this was partially offset by inventory sales growth impacted all components of working capital however deflation contributed to lower levels of increase in fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  

included in the change in other longterm liabilities was a positive comparison primarily from pension contributions pension contributions were 576 million  in fiscal 2017  including a 250 million  contribution to our us retirement plan in fiscal 2017  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities pension contributions were 1575 million  in fiscal 2016  including a 130 million  contribution to our retirement plan in fiscal 2016  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities the level and timing of the contribution to our retirement plan in fiscal 2018  is still being determined 

the positive comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to 3125 million  in us foods merger termination fees that were paid in fiscal 2016  partially offset by a 702 million  decrease from incentive payments our annual incentive payments 

for performance in the prior fiscal year are paid in the first quarter of each succeeding fiscal year incentive payments paid in fiscal 2017  were higher than amounts paid in fiscal 2016  due to larger payouts achieved from fiscal 2016  performance 

our tax payments in fiscal 2016  were lower than in fiscal 2017  due to changes in tax elections allowing us to accelerate tax deductions from method changes which in turn significantly reduced our estimated payments in fiscal 2016  by delaying the timing of these payments to future periods additionally sysco’s fourth quarter us estimated federal tax payment for fiscal 2016  was deferred to the second quarter of fiscal 2017  due to a disaster area designation for companies located in the houston area the location of our corporate headquarters we made tax payments of approximately 7614 million  in fiscal 2017  including an approximate 120 million for the deferred tax payment from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  we expect future tax payments to grow with our earnings 

fiscal 2016  vs fiscal 2015 

we generated 19 billion  in cash flows from operations in fiscal 2016  compared to cash flow generation of 16 billion  in fiscal 2015  this increase of 3777 million  yearoveryear was largely attributable to tax payments deferred to future periods and improved working capital management partially offset by an unfavorable comparison on accrued expenses and other longterm liabilities the cash impact of our certain items increased 489 million  yearoveryear the cash impact of certain items will differ from the earnings impact of certain items as the payments for these items may occur in a different period from the period in which the certain item charges were recognized in the statement of consolidated results of operations the extra week in fiscal 2016  also contributed to the increase in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  

our tax payments in fiscal 2016  were lower than in fiscal 2015  due to changes in tax elections allowing us to accelerate tax deductions from method changes which in turn significantly reduced our estimated payments in fiscal 2016  by delaying the timing of these payments to future periods additionally syscos fourth quarter us estimated federal tax payment was deferred to the second quarter of fiscal 2017  due to a disaster area designation for companies located in the houston area the location of our corporate headquarters 

the negative comparison on accrued expenses was primarily due to 3125 million  in us foods merger termination payments and a 471 million  decrease from incentive payments our annual incentive payments for performance in the prior fiscal year are paid in the first quarter of each succeeding fiscal year incentive payments paid in fiscal 2015  were lower than amounts paid in fiscal 2016  due to lower payouts achieved from fiscal 2014  performance also contributing to the negative comparison was lower payroll accruals due to timing and reduced accrued interest due to differing debt levels and interest payment dates 

included in the change in other longterm liabilities was a negative comparison primarily from pension contributions of 1534 million  pension contributions were 1575 million  in fiscal 2016  including a 130 million  contribution to our retirement plan in fiscal 2016  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities of this 130 million  amount 100 million  represented funding that the company would have made in fiscal 2017  but chose to fund in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  pension contributions were 751 million  in fiscal 2015  including a 50 million  contribution to our retirement plan in fiscal 2015  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities 

changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable had a positive impact of 1279 million  on the period over period comparison of cash flow from operations primarily from improvements in inventory management sales growth impacted all components of working capital however deflation contributed to lower levels of increase in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  additionally favorable turnover drove positive comparisons on inventories 

investing activities 

fiscal 2017  capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2016  capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2015  capital expenditures included 

 

the level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2017  increased 1590 million  as compared to fiscal 2016  the increase was primarily due to 1319 million  associated with the brakes group capital expenditures in fiscal 2016  decreased by 155 million  

we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2018  to be approximately 13  to 14  of fiscal sales fiscal 2018  expenditures will include facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions new facility construction including foldout facilities and investments in technology 

during fiscal 2017  the company paid cash of 29 billion  for acquisitions net of cash acquired including the brakes group and also acquired a small produce company in sweden 

during fiscal 2016  the company paid cash of 2192 million  for acquisitions including a leading luxury personal care amenity provider in the hospitality industry a distributor of highquality fresh and frozen seafood based in florida and an innovative ecommerce platform providing restaurant supplies and equipment exclusively to sysco customers during fiscal 2016  we paid 1035 million  and received 575 million  for options to hedge against the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the purchase price of the brakes acquisition 

during fiscal 2015  in the aggregate the company paid cash of 1159 million  for operations acquired during fiscal 2015  and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years we also acquired a broadline company in ontario canada a joint venture interest in a foodservice distribution company in mexico a joint venture interest in a foodservice distribution company in costa rica and a specialty seafood company in new jersey 

free cash flow 

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions however free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments as a result of increased cash provided by operating activities free cash flow for fiscal 2017  increased 59  or 845 million  to 15 billion  as compared to fiscal 2016  our cash requirements for our certain items were 1939 million  lower in fiscal 2017  than in fiscal 2016  as a result of increased cash provided by operating activities decreased capital spending and decreased proceeds from sale of plant and equipment free cash flow for fiscal 2016  increased 378  or 3922 million  to 14 billion  as compared to fiscal 2015  

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable gaap measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap in the table that follows free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 





financing activities 

equity transactions 

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 2048 million  in fiscal 2017  2825 million  in fiscal 2016  and 2402 million  in fiscal 2015  the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price and the time remaining before option grants expire 

we routinely engage in share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during fiscal 2017  were 35744589  shares for 19 billion  with 44716180  shares repurchased in fiscal 2016  for 19 billion  no shares were acquired in fiscal 2015 due to the proposed us foods merger in june 2015 our board of directors approved a program to repurchase from time to time in the open market through an accelerated share repurchase program or through privately negotiated transactions shares of the company’s common stock in an amount not to exceed 30 billion  during the twoyear period ending july 1 2017 in addition to amounts normally repurchased to offset benefit plan and stock option dilution we executed all 30 billion  of this authorization in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  in addition to the share repurchase program approved in june 2015 in august 2015 our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 20000000  shares for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 800 million  the authorization expired on august 21 2017 we executed all 800 million  under this authorization and purchased 6859399  shares through july 1 2017  in february 2017  our board of directors approved a separate repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the company’s common stock not to exceed 10 billion  through the end of fiscal 2019  we repurchased 232685  shares for 116 million under this authorization through july 1 2017  we repurchased 3026737  additional shares for 1540 million  through august 11 2017  we intend to continue purchasing shares under our current repurchase program in fiscal 2018  through open market purchases to align with our capital allocation strategy which will involve opportunistic purchases and purchases to offset dilution resulting from shares issued under the company’s benefit plans 

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our companys inception over 40 years ago dividends paid were 6986 million  or 128  per share in fiscal 2017  6989 million  or  122  per share in fiscal 2016  and 6953 million  or 117  per share in fiscal 2015  in may 2017  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  of 033  per share which was paid in july 2017  we expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2018 

in august 2015 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which we as a wellknown seasoned issuer have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 11 2017  29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

  

debt activity and borrowing availability 

our debt activity including issuances and repayments and our borrowing availability is described in note 11  debt and other financing arrangements our outstanding borrowings at july 1 2017  and repayment activity since the close of fiscal 2017  are disclosed within those notes updated amounts through august 11 2017  include 

 

our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 097  for fiscal 2017  049  for fiscal 2016  and 054  for fiscal 2015  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of july 1 2017  certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 



 

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july 1 2017 were 153 million  this amount is not included in the table above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the companysponsored pension plans income taxes goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our us retirement plan is largely frozen and is only open to a small number of employees our serp is frozen and is not open to any employees our uk retirement plan is also frozen to new participants due to the low level of active employees in our retirement plans our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is not a critical assumption 

for guidance in determining the discount rates for our us pension plans we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rates for our international pension plans were calculated using annualized corporate bond yield and spread curves that are similar to the respective expected cash flows of each plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 2017  net pension costs for the us retirement plan decreased 77  basis points to 407  as of the july 2 2016  measurement date the discount rate for determining fiscal 2017  net pension costs for the serp decreased 72  basis points to 391  as of the july 2 2016  measurement date the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2017  by an estimated 8 million  the discount rate for determining fiscal 2018  net pension costs for the us retirement plan increased 12  basis points to 419  as of the july 1 2017  measurement date the discount rate for determining fiscal 2018  net pension costs for the serp increased 17  basis points to 408  as of the july 1 2017  measurement date the combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2018  by an estimated 1 million  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rates for fiscal 2017  would decrease or increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by approximately 10 million  sysco’s pension plans are primarily frozen therefore the net companysponsored pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to an active plan 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us retirement plan was 725  for both fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the uk retirement plan was 415  for fiscal 2017  the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on the us retirement plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 69  56  96  and 115  over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended us plan  respectively in addition in four  of the last 15  years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10  the effective annual rate of return on the uk retirement plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 18  over the 1year period ended june 30 2017 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the us and uk retirement plans are 700  and 455  respectively for fiscal 2018  a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return in each plan for fiscal 2018  would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2017  by approximately 36 million  

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as 

of july 1 2017  was a charge net of tax of 9742 million  the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 2 2016  was a charge net of tax of 11 billion  

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of  576 million  and 1575 million  in fiscal years 2017  and 2016  respectively our contributions in fiscal 2017  include a 25 million  contribution to the us retirement plan that was voluntary as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2017  plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements there are no required contributions to the us retirement plan to meet erisa minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2018  the estimated fiscal 2018  contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately 305 million  the estimated fiscal 2018  contributions to fund benefit payments for the international retirement plans are approximately 92 million  

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment in estimating the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control of a business is obtained 100 of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values we use multiple valuation methods to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets we generally use the income method which uses a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill more information on our acquisitions can be found in note 4  acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

annually in our fourth quarter we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets impairment reviews outside our annual review time frame are performed if events or circumstances occur that include changes in macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance other relevant entityspecific events specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price 

for fiscal 2017  we tested 21  reporting units from our 15  operating segments as described in note 21  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 certain of our operating segments are disaggregated into components for testing purposes while other components with similar economic characteristics are aggregated and tested at the operating segment level our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment however if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is performed 

when using a quantitative test we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings or revenue multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each reporting unit we generally use a higher weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation compared to the earnings multiple models because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s 

outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant when reporting units represent recently acquired operations we generally use a higher weighting for our earnings multiple models than our discounted cash flow valuation as we believe this aligns with how acquired operations are valued in the market place the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings or revenue multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2016  and 2015  would not have been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years with the exception of introducing a qualitative assessment in fiscal 2017  for seven reporting units we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2017  assessment our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis however we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our brakes uk broadline fresh direct specialty sweden broadline ireland broadline mexico broadline and costa rica broadline reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by an amount in the range of 5  and 28  with goodwill of 17 billion  in the aggregate as of july 1 2017  recorded for these reporting units 

certain reporting units such as those noted above have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the us broadline reporting unit as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

sharebased compensation 

sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans a nonemployee director plan and the employee stock purchase plan espp 

as of july 1 2017  there was 954 million  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 21 years  

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award and performance share unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units and performance share units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period expense recognized on performance share unit awards is subsequently adjusted based on forecasted performance compared to planned targets until the performance period concludes and the actual number of shares of sysco common stock to be received upon the vesting of the performance share units is known 

the fair value of the stock issued under the espp is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or nonemployee directors is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the espp is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

our sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our market risks consist of interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk fuel price risk and investment risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

at july 1 2017  there were 1197 million  in commercial paper issuances outstanding total debt as of july 1 2017  was 82 billion  of which approximately 71  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

at july 2 2016  there were no  commercial paper issuances outstanding total debt as of july 2 2016  was 74 billion  of which approximately 68  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

details of our outstanding swap agreements as of july 1 2017  are below 



we receive or pay amounts on these interest rate swap agreements on a semiannual basis 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of july 1 2017  all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 



 



rate a – sixmonth libor 

rate b – threemonth libor 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our largest currency exposures are with canadian dollars british pound sterling and euro currencies our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively  impacted sales by 01  in fiscal 2017  when compared to fiscal 2016  the exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively  impacted sales by 13  in fiscal 2016  when compared to fiscal 2015  the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016  a 10  unfavorable change in the fiscal 2017  weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2017  sales by 18  and would not have materially impacted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our brakes acquisition created additional foreign currency exposure in fiscal 2017  we designated €500 million  of euro notes issued in june 2016 and various cross currency swaps as hedges of a portion of our net investment in eurodenominated and sterlingdenominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations changes in the value of these items resulting from fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates to us dollar exchange rates are recorded 

as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss in fiscal 2017  we entered into various cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of exchange rate changes for an intercompany loan that is not in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries these have been designated as cash flow hedges with changes recorded within foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

fuel price risk 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 05  of sales during both fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges during fiscal 2017  we began entering into diesel fuel swaps for fiscal 2018 for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of july 1 2017  we had diesel fuel swaps with a total notional amount of approximately 780 million  through june 2018  these swaps will lock in the price of approximately 55 to 60  of our projected fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2018  our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price or hedged at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10  unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 86 million  in our fuel costs on our noncontracted volumes 

investment risk 

our companysponsored qualified pension plans us retirement plan and uk retirement plan hold various investments including public and private equity fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10  unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plans at the plan’s fiscal year end  december 31 2016  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2018  however such an unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2018  by 340 million  and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of july 1 2017  by 3342 million  an unfavorable change in the fair value of our uk plan assets would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2018  by 21 million  and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of july 1 2017  by 259 million

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to modernize expand and construct new distribution facilities during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  approximately 5428 million  5232 million   and 5119 million  respectively were invested in delivery fleet facilities technology and other capital asset enhancements from time to time we dispose of assets in the normal course of business we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets were 5184 million  4974 million  and 4963 million  respectively we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2016  should be in the range of 550 million  to 600 million  during the three years ended june 27 2015  capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2016  capital expenditures from the same sources 

  

employees 

  

as of june 27 2015  we had approximately 51700  employees approximately 18  of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 37  of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or will expire during fiscal 2016  and are subject to renegotiation since june 27 2015  there have been no contract renegotiations we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

  

competition 

  

industry sources estimate that there are more than 16500  companies engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry in the us our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers online retailers and ecommerce companies are also participants in the foodservice industry while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors some organizations compete with us on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently product needs service requirements and price are just a few of the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly there are few barriers to market entry existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers 

  

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the us and canada and estimate that we serve about 177  of this approximately 264 billion  annual market based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2014  we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2015  while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our more than 7300  marketing associates our diversified product base which includes a differentiated group of high quality sysco brand products the diversity in the types of customers we serve our economies of scale and our multiregion portfolio in the us and canada which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements we are one of the few distributors in the foodawayfromhome industry in the us with publicly traded equity while our public company status provides us with some advantages over many of our competitors including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that most of them do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

  

government regulation 

  

our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business in many jurisdictions compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions in general competition laws are designed to protect businesses and consumers from anticompetitive behavior 

in the us as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda the fda regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

  

we and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

  

we are also subject to regulation by numerous federal state and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor which sets employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation which regulates transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies in addition we are also subject to the us false claims act and similar state statutes which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments 

  

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized we have implemented and continue to develop a robust anticorruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anticorruption laws in countries where we operate 

  

outside the us our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations as well as other legal and regulatory requirements 

  

all of our companys facilities and other operations in the us and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater further most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements we are subject to other federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials however these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

  

general 

  

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco ®  trademark and our privatelybranded product trademarks that include the sysco ®  trademark these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry approximately half of our privatelybranded sales are from products labeled with our sysco ®  trademark without any other trademark we believe the loss of the sysco ®  trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our us trademarks are effective for a tenyear period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use the company does not have any material patents or licenses 

  

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

  

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

as of june 27 2015  we operated 197  distribution facilities throughout the us bahamas canada and ireland we have interests in joint venture operations in costa rica and mexico 




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and from historical trends 

  

industry and general economic risks 

  

periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability    

  

volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may negatively impact our business due to the timing needed to pass on such increases the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive environment conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

  

unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in the us as well as unfavorable conditions in particular local markets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the foodservice distribution industry which is characterized by relatively low profit margins with limited demand growth expected in the nearterm is especially susceptible to negative trends and economic uncertainty the us has experienced an uneven economic environment over the past several years in addition our results of operations are substantially affected by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

   

the uncertainty in the economic environment has adversely affected the rate of improvement in both business and consumer confidence and spending and uncertainty about the longterm investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity     

  

competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers and makes it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability    

  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional multiregional distributors and specialty competitors furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion 

by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures and group purchasing organizations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and profitability finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increasing competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

  

if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our market share sales and profitability through increased expenditures or decreased prices could be adversely impacted 

  

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and forward purchase commitments intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs    

  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future if fuel costs increase in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the thencurrent forward price for diesel if fuel prices decrease significantly these forward purchases will result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel 

  

business and operational risks 

  

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs    

  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages animal disease outbreaks transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

  

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings    

  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business the sysco brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or public confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to activities by our operations employees suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and diminish the value of our brand which could adversely affect our revenues and profits 

  

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis salmonella listeria or swine flu and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact public confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically 

  

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation would have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

unfavorable changes to the mix of locallymanaged customers versus corporatemanaged customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

gross margin from our corporatemanaged customers is generally lower than that of our locallymanaged customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locallymanaged customers if sales to our locallymanaged customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our corporatemanaged customers our operating margins may decline 

  

moreover if sales to our corporatemanaged customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locallymanaged customers we will become more dependent on corporatemanaged customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales additionally the loss of sales to the larger of these corporatemanaged customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers we could be pressured by them to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event we would need to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases or our gross margins and profitability could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

we may not realize anticipated benefits from our operating cost reduction efforts     

we have implemented and expect to implement in the future cost reduction initiatives that we believe are necessary to position our business for future success and growth our future success and earnings growth will be significantly impacted by our ability to achieve a lower cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity and low growth rates a variety of factors could cause us not to realize some of the expected cost savings including among other things delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings initiatives lack of sustainability in cost savings over time and unexpected costs associated with operating our business if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease furthermore even if we realize the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction efforts we may experience an adverse effect on our employees customers and suppliers which could negatively affect our sales and profits 

  

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful    

  

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse effect on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations 

  

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include 

the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

product liability claims could materially impact our business  

  

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business    

we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business such as food safety and sanitation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting seizures or debarments from contracting with the government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively  

  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely affected integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

  

we need access to borrowed funds to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity  

  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

  

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

  

as described in note 11 “debt and other financing arrangements” as of june 27 2015  we had approximately 73 billion  of total indebtedness which included a commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 15 billion  a revolving credit facility supporting our united states and canadian commercial paper programs in the amount of 15 billion  scheduled to expire on december 29 2018  and various other smaller bank facilities in july 2015 we redeemed 50 billion in senior notes using cash on hand and the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program 

our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures potential acquisitions or joint ventures and we expect to incur additional indebtedness to fund our repurchase of up to 3 billion  in sysco common stock announced in june 2015  our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of future debt financing and financial results and our credit ratings may be adversely affected as a result of the incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

  

our liquidity can be negatively impacted by payments required to appeal tax assessments with certain tax jurisdictions  

  

certain tax jurisdictions require partial to full payment of audit assessments or the posting of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process sysco has posted approximately 90 million  in letters of credit to appeal the canadian revenue agency assessments of transfer pricing adjustments relating to our cross border procurement activities through our former purchasing cooperative on our 2004 through 2009 fiscal years if assessed on later years currently under examination using these same positions we could have to pay cash or post additional letters of credit of as much as 16 million  in order to appeal these further assessments if significant further payments are required the company’s financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 

we rely on technology in our business and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could have a material negative impact on our business    

  

our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis any disruption to these computer systems could adversely affect our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits 

  

furthermore process changes will be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing delivery and payroll systems to support operations as we implement an enterprise resource planning erp system while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits 

  

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers    

  

we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

  

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 10  of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2015  our total contributions to these plans were approximately 381 million  which included payments for withdrawal liabilities of 14 million  the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 245 million  as of june 27 2015  a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

  

at the end of fiscal 2012 we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all us based salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 32 billion  as of june 27 2015  therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements although recent pension funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions that provided the relief are phased out see note 14 “companysponsored employee benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the retirement plan 

the amount of our annual contribution to the retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability our retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse effect on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

  

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

  

as of june 27 2015  approximately 9446 employees at 55  operating companies were members of 58  different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2016  24 agreements covering approximately 3500 employees have expired or will expire failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect our business and materially reduce earnings  

  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our employee recruitment development and retention efforts may not be successful resulting in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco which could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a yearoveryear basis other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from multiemployer pension withdrawal charges severance charges integration planning litigation costs and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods inc us foods facility closure charges and us foods related financing costs additional items in fiscal 2014  include a change in estimate of selfinsurance and charges from a contingency accrual these fiscal 2015  and 2014  items are collectively referred to as certain items our us foods financing costs include the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs when our bridge acquisition facility was terminated upon the issuance of our senior notes in october 2014 and interest expense on those senior notes in fiscal 2014  costs from executive 

retirement plans restructuring were included within certain items however because these costs in fiscal 2015  are comparable to fiscal 2014  these were not included in the certain items definition for the comparison of adjusted results for fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2014  this continues to be presented as a certain item in the comparison of adjusted results for fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” and liquidity and capital resources 

  

overview 

  

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our primary operations are located throughout the united states us bahamas canada costa rica ireland and mexico and include broadline companies sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary specialty produce companies customcut meat companies hotel supply operations a company that distributes specialty imported products a company that distributes to international customers and our sysco ventures platform which includes our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers 

  

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the us canada and ireland and estimate that we serve about 177  of this approximately 264 billion  annual market based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2014  we use industry data obtained from various sources including technomic inc the canadian restaurant and foodservices association and the irish food board to calculate this measurement according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 48  of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar 2014  

  

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the us experienced a real sales increase of approximately 07  in calendar year 2014  and 11  in calendar year 2013  real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

  

highlights 

the foodservice industry performance in fiscal 2015  was generally improved consumer confidence and the outlook of foodservice operators are at high levels but have decreased slightly in the summer months of 2015  fuel prices declined during fiscal 2015  and are currently at lower levels as compared to recent years that may support higher consumer spending in the future spending at restaurants is generally improved but customer traffic levels are generally unchanged overall the market environment appears to be modestly improved as compared to the prior two years however uncertainty in industry growth remains for fiscal 2016  amid these conditions we provided our customers with excellent service growing our business with both our locally and corporate managed customers and stabilizing our gross margins by successfully implementing several valueadded commercial initiatives we improved our expense management performance as the year progressed achieving greater success managing expenses in the second half of the year as compared to the first half the impact of certain items contributed to lower earnings in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily from the costs associated with the merger that had been proposed with us foods

business transformation 

  

in fiscal 2015  we completed the threeyear financial objectives of our business transformation these financial objectives were largely designed to lower our product cost and lower our operating cost structure we implemented a category management 

program to leverage our scale and develop deeper more strategic relationships with our suppliers to drive growth and innovation we also implemented multiple initiatives to lower our operating cost structure including a more streamlined and standard approach to the management of fleet labor maintenance procurement and supplies our goal for the project was to generate approximately 550 million  to 650 million  in annual benefits to be achieved by fiscal 2015  we exceeded our final threeyear target for annualized benefits 

us foods merger termination 

  

we sought to merge with us foods a leading foodservice distributor in the us the merger was reviewed by the federal trade commission ftc and in february 2015 the ftc commissioners voted 3 to 2 to authorize the ftc staff to seek a preliminary injunction from the us district court for the district of columbia preventing the parties from closing the merger in june 2015 the preliminary injunction was granted shortly thereafter the parties involved agreed to terminate the merger agreement as a result of which sysco was obligated to pay 300 million  to the owners of us foods during the review period with the ftc sysco created a divestiture package comprised of the sale of 11 us foods facilities to performance food group pfg which was contingent on the closing of the merger this divestiture agreement entitled pfg to receive a 25 million  termination fee if the sale of the divestiture package was terminated before july 6 2015 with each of sysco and us foods responsible for one half of the applicable fee sysco accrued for termination payments totaling 3125 million  in fiscal 2015  and paid these amounts in fiscal 2016  

the following tables outline our expenses attributable to our integration planning litigation and termination costs and financing activities for the periods presented 



  

fiscal 2015 acquisitions

trends and strategy 

  

trends 

  

general economic conditions can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales consumer confidence and employment metrics such as 

unemployment rates have shown some signs of improvement during fiscal 2015  however consumer spending has been cautious fuel prices are currently at lower levels as compared to recent years that may support higher consumer spending in the future overall the market environment appears to be modestly improved as compared to the prior two years however uncertainty in industry growth remains for fiscal 2016 one industry resource technomic inc has projected roughly 2  real growth annually real growth excludes the impact of inflation or deflation 

our sales and gross profit performance can be influenced by multiple factors including price volume and product mix the modest level of growth in the foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures which is in turn negatively impacting sales and gross profits case growth with our locallymanaged broadline business is an important contributor to gross profit dollar growth our locallymanaged customers including independent restaurant customers comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes and an even greater percentage of profitability due to the high level of value added services we typically provide to this customer group through focused efforts our locallymanaged case volume growth has accelerated over the past three years our sales to corporatemanaged customers including chain restaurants and multilocational restaurants also comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes gross margin on sales to our corporatemanaged customers is generally lower than sales to other types of customers due to the higher volumes we sell to these customers case growth for our corporatemanaged customers remained strong but competitive pricing pressure has constrained our gross margins inflation is a factor that contributes to the level of sales and gross profit growth and can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure food cost inflation in fiscal 2015  was 37  an increase from 21  experienced in fiscal 2014  our inflation rates were higher in the first half of fiscal 2015  reaching levels of 60  at the midpoint of the fiscal year and dropping to 01  by the end of the fiscal year while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative effect on us and our customers high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers in addition rapid declines in prices can make it challenging to leverage our fixed costs our category management initiative has helped us to manage our gross margin performance in response to several of these factors lastly changes in foreign exchange rates are having a larger impact on our sales as compared to recent fiscal years the strengthening us dollar is depressing our foreign sales as we convert them to us dollars the impact of foreign exchange rates for fiscal 2015  was a 10  yearoveryear decrease to sales growth this impact has typically been in the range of 0  to 05  

we have experienced higher operating expenses in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily from increased payroll costs and integration planning litigation and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods we anticipate a low level of operating expenses attributable to the merger termination in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  our payroll costs have been influenced by higher pay in our sales organization as a result of higher gross profits investment in new administrative support capabilities higher management incentive accruals due to improved performance against our incentive targets and companies acquired within the last 12 months sales and gross profit growth partially contributed to an increase in sales payrelated expenses due to increases in sales commissions and bonuses in addition we have increased our marketing associate headcount in certain markets in order to invest in future sales growth 

in october 2014  we secured longterm financing for the proposed merger with us foods therefore interest expense increased in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the october 2014  senior notes contained mandatory redemption features providing that if the merger agreement were terminated on or prior to october 8 2015  we were required to redeem all of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 101  of the principal of the senior notes plus accrued interest in june 2015  we terminated the merger agreement and redeemed the senior notes in july 2015  using cash on hand and the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper facility in fiscal 2016  we will recognize several charges from the redemption of these senior notes including 500 million  in premium fees 29 million  in unamortized debt issuance costs and 180 million  in unamortized bond discounts each of which had resulted from the issuance of the senior notes in october 2014  we had hedged 125 billion  of this debt by swapping the fixed rates to floating rates with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost we terminated these swaps in july 2015  and will recognize a gain of 100 million  from the fair value adjustment that had been recorded on the underlying debt our interest expense on the notes was treated as a certain item in fiscal 2015  since the proposed merger had not closed similarly these charges and gain associated with the repayment of these notes will be presented as certain items in fiscal 2016  as discussed in note 9 “derivative financial instruments” two forward starting swap agreements used to hedge interest rate risk exposure on our october 2014  senior notes issuance were previously terminated and were paid in the amount of 1888 million  the resulting amounts recorded as a loss are currently amortizing into interest expense at a rate of 25 million  per quarter for the next 9 years  and 11 million  per quarter thereafter for another 19 years  these amounts will continue to amortize into interest expense as the amount hedged is anticipated to remain within our capital structure 

following the termination of the merger agreement we announced a 3 billion  two year share repurchase program we intend to execute the first half of this program through an accelerated repurchase program near the end of first quarter of fiscal 2016  we expect to issue 20 billion  of debt at approximately the same time and we intend to use a majority of the proceeds to fund these repurchases these actions will lower our basic and diluted shares outstanding providing an expected earnings per share benefit of approximately 003  to 004  per share this estimate includes a 4  to 5  reduction in average shares outstanding 

partially offset by higher interest expense from the new debt issuance because the share repurchase will take place near the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we will not realize a fullyears benefit from the reduction in shares in fiscal 2016 however the fullyear benefit will be realized in fiscal 2017 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30 th  we will have a 53week year ending july 2 2016  for fiscal 2016  and this additional week will be presented as a certain item in fiscal 2016  

strategy 

  

we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the us bahamas canada costa rica ireland and mexico while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business daytoday our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service with the aspirational vision of becoming each of our customers’ most valued and trusted business partner we have identified five components of our strategy to help us achieve our mission and vision as follows 

 

in fiscal 2016  to further our strategy we see opportunities to further accelerate case growth especially with our locallymanaged sales customers through improved product and service differentiation combined with enhanced sales and technology capabilities we will continue to build on our success in stabilizing gross margin through enhanced product innovation growing privatelybranded product sales and improving pricing analytics and support there continues to be opportunity to improve our productivity and reduce overhead costs in our supply chain organization and administrative areas of our business we will continue to invest in our business to fully realize the benefits and improve our return on invested capital

sales 

  

sales for fiscal 2015  were 47  higher than fiscal 2014  sales for fiscal 2015  increased as a result of product cost inflation and the corresponding increase in selling prices case volume growth and sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 37  during fiscal 2015  driven mainly by inflation in the meat seafood and dairy categories case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 26  in fiscal 2015  case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 24  in fiscal 2015  our case volumes represent our results from our broadline and sygma segments combined sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 06  in fiscal 2015  the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 10  in fiscal 2015  

  

sales for fiscal 2014  were 47  higher than fiscal 2013  sales for fiscal 2014  increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and case volume growth our sales growth in fiscal 2014  was greater with our corporatemanaged customers as compared to sales growth with our locallymanaged customers we believe our locallymanaged customer sales growth was negatively influenced by less favorable consumer sentiment case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 22  in fiscal 2014  our case volumes represent our results from our broadline and sygma segments combined sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 14  for fiscal 2014  case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months 

improved approximately 34  in fiscal 2014  changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 21  during fiscal 2014  the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal 2013  

  

operating income 

  

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 

  

fiscal 2015  vs fiscal 2014   

  

the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

  



  

the decrease in operating income was impacted by an increase of 4160 million  in operating expenses attributable to certain items adjusted operating income increased due to gross profit dollar growth partially offset by increased expenses from greater case volumes higher incentive accruals higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to increased sales volumes stronger relative mix of sales to our locallymanaged customers and benefits from category management gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of sales was 1757  in fiscal 2015  a decline of 2  basis points from the gross margin of 1759  in fiscal 2014  increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market and volatile inflation has pressured our gross margins however sales and mix as well as our category management initiative have helped us stabilize our gross margin performance inflation in fiscal 2015  was 37  an increase from 21  experienced in fiscal 2014  our inflation rates were higher in the first half of fiscal 2015  reaching 60  at the midpoint of the fiscal year and dropping to 01  by the end of the fiscal year fiscal 2015  inflation was seen primarily in the meat dairy and poultry categories 

  

operating expenses for fiscal 2015  increased 110  or 7282 million  over fiscal 2014  adjusted operating expenses for fiscal 2015  increased 48  or 3123 million  over fiscal 2014  these increases in adjusted operating expenses were primarily due to increased expenses from greater case volumes higher incentive accruals higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in fuel costs and provisions for losses on receivables sysco’s operating expenses were impacted by certain items which resulted in an increase in operating expenses of 416 million  in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  more information on the rationale of the use of adjusted operating expense and adjusted operating income and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

operating expenses impacting adjusted operating income 

  

our operating expenses increased in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  partially due to greater case volumes higher incentive accruals higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations payrelated expenses which represent a significant portion of our operating costs increased  by 3493 million  in fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  factors contributing to the increase in 2015  include increase in expense related to management incentive accruals of 1035 million  higher pay in our sales organization largely as a result of higher gross profits higher costs due to investment in new administrative support capabilities and companies acquired in the last 12 months the 

amounts for companies acquired within the last 12 months include our new consolidated joint ventures such as our 50 interest in a foodservice company in costa rica sales and gross profit growth partially contributed to an increase in sales payrelated expenses due to increases in sales commissions and bonuses in addition we have increased our marketing associate headcount in certain markets in order to invest in future sales growth our expense related to management incentive accruals will vary based on how the company’s performance compares to incentive targets our fiscal 2015  financial performance trended more favorably relative to the applicable management incentive targets as compared to fiscal 2014  consequently expense is higher period over period 

  

cost per case is an important metric management uses to measure our expense performance this metric is calculated by dividing the total operating expense of our north american broadline companies by the number of cases sold adjusted cost per case is calculated similarly however the operating expense component excludes severance and multiemployer pension withdrawal charges which are the certain items applicable to these companies divided by the number of cases sold our corporate expenses are not included in the cost per cases metrics because the metric is a measure of efficiency in our operations we seek to grow our sales and either minimize or reduce our costs on a per case basis our cost per case and adjusted cost per case increased 004  per case in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the impact of foreign exchange rates lowered our cost per case results by 005  per case for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 which partially offset the rate of increase occurring primarily from increased payrelated expenses we are focused on driving improvement across our operations with multiple initiatives that implement best practices enhance our operating training programs and improve our ability to measure and analyze our performance more information on the rationale for the use of adjusted operating income and adjusted cost per case and reconciliations can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

certain items within operating expenses 

  

sysco’s operating expenses are impacted by certain items which are expenses that can be difficult to predict can be unanticipated or do not represent core operating expenses more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” our significant certain items applicable for fiscal 2015  included costs related to integration planning litigation costs and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods our significant certain items applicable for fiscal 2014  related to costs in connection with the then proposed merger with us foods a change in estimate of our selfinsurance reserve and a liability for a settlement 

  

we incurred costs in connection with the proposed merger with us foods announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily from integration planning litigation costs and termination costs these costs totaled 5547 million  in fiscal 2015  and 906 million  in fiscal 2014  

our selfinsurance program covers portions of workers’ compensation general and vehicle liability and property insurance costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 based on the historical trends of increased costs primarily attributable to our workers compensation claims we increase d our estimates of our selfinsurance reserve to a higher point in an estimated range of liability as opposed to our past position at the lower end of the range this resulted in a charge of 238 million  in fiscal 2014  

  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 sysco was made aware of certain alleged violations of california law relating to its use of remote storage units in the delivery of products these are commonly referred to as drop sites as of june 28 2014  we recorded a liability for a settlement of 20 million  in july 2014 sysco agreed to a 194 million  settlement which includes a payment of 150 million  in penalties 33 million  to fund four california department of public health investigator positions for five years a 10 million  donation to food banks across california and 01 million  in legal fees in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we eliminated the use of drop sites across sysco during fiscal 2014  we introduced mandatory annual food safety training for all employees across sysco we are implementing additional and improved food safety reporting monitoring and compliance controls across our operations to ensure adherence to our policies 

fiscal   2014   vs fiscal   2013   

  

the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

  



  

the decrease in operating income was impacted by an increase in 551 million  in operating expenses attributable to certain items operating income and adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014  were lower than fiscal 2013  primarily from a lower rate of growth in our gross profit increased expenses from higher case volumes some of which is attributable to our acquired operations increased depreciation and amortization increased delivery costs and higher corporate expenses these were partially offset by lower business transformation project expenses and benefits from business transformation project initiatives as a percentage of sales we experienced favorable expense management due in part to benefits from our business transformation project initiatives 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to increased sales volumes the first half of fiscal 2014  contained weaker gross profit growth of 12  as compared to the same period in fiscal 2013  inflation and locallymanaged customers case growth was lower in the first half of fiscal 2014  inflation increased as did localmanaged customers case growth in the second half of fiscal 2014  gross profits grew at a greater rate of 34  in the second half of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same time period in fiscal 2013  as result of these factors and in part from our business transformation project initiatives gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of sales was 1759  in fiscal 2014  a decline of 42  basis points from the gross margin of 1801  in fiscal 2013  this decline in gross margin was partially the result of weak restaurant traffic and increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market increased sales to lower margin corporatemanaged customers also contributed to the decline in fiscal 2014  our inflation rates were relatively stable over the first three quarters of fiscal 2014  however it increased in the fourth quarter all quarters being compared to the past year fourth quarter fiscal 2014  inflation was seen primarily in the meat seafood and dairy categories which represent more than onethird of our annual sales 

  

operating expenses for fiscal 2014  increased 40  or 2558 million  over fiscal 2013  adjusted operating expenses for fiscal 2014  increased 32  or 2007 million  over fiscal 2013  these increases were primarily due to increased expenses from higher case volumes some of which is attributable to our acquired operations increased depreciation and amortization increased delivery costs and higher corporate expenses these were partially offset by lower business transformation project expenses and benefits from business transformation project initiatives we believe favorable expense management partially from our business transformation project initiatives helped to keep our operating expense increases from being greater sysco’s operating expenses are impacted by certain charges and adjustments which we refer to as certain items and which resulted in an increase in operating expenses of 551 million  in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  more information on the rationale of the use of adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating income and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations 

  

operating expenses impacting adjusted operating income 

  

our operating expenses increased in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  partially due to expenses from our acquired operations expenses attributable to volume growth and increased delivery costs payrelated expenses represent a significant portion of our operating costs contributed to the increase in each of these three categories of expenses and contributed to cost increases in our corporate expenses payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project us foods integration planning and retirementrelated expenses increased  by 744 million  in fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  the increase was primarily due to costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months as well as increased delivery and warehouse compensation partially attributable to case growth payrelated costs have also increased at our corporate office as certain employee costs attributed to our business transformation project in fiscal 2013  were no longer attributed to the business transformation 

project in fiscal 2014  due to a change in allocation methodology in fiscal 2013  we allocated internal associates based upon estimates of the percentage of time they spent on the project in fiscal 2014  only associates that were dedicated full time to the project are included in business transformation project costs these increases were partially offset by reduced sales compensation information technology compensation and lower provisions for management incentive plans benefits from our business transformation project initiatives helped in lowering the rate of growth in these expenses particularly in our sales area for fiscal 2014  during fiscal 2013  we streamlined our sales management organization and modified marketing associate compensation plans fiscal 2014  was also impacted by a reduction in pay in the information technology area resulting from the restructuring of this department in fiscal 2013  which reduced headcount in this area 

depreciation and amortization expense excluding the increase related to our business transformation project described below increase d by 328 million  in fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  the increase was primarily related to depreciation on assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2013  that were in service in fiscal 2014  

our retirementrelated expenses consist primarily of costs from our retirement plan serp and our defined contribution plans as a part of our business transformation project initiatives our retirement plan was substantially frozen and the serp was completely frozen in fiscal 2013  and our defined contribution plans were enhanced with greater benefits the net impact in fiscal 2014  of our retirementrelated expenses as compared to fiscal 2013  was a decrease  of 868 million  consisting of a 1336 million   decrease  in our net companysponsored pension costs and approximately 62 million  for other costs partially offset by 530 million   increase d costs from our defined contribution plans 

in addition to the increases in our corporate office expenses from payrelated expenses noted above other sources of cost increases in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  were due to increasing the capabilities of various departments within our corporate office a subset of our business technology costs was attributable to our business transformation project expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated and software amortization expense were 277 million  in fiscal 2014  and 3305 million  in fiscal 2013  representing a decrease  of 535 million  the decrease in fiscal 2014  resulted from a reduction in certain employee costs that were attributed to our business transformation project in fiscal 2013  that were no longer attributed to the business transformation project in fiscal 2014  due to a change in allocation methodology in fiscal 2013  we allocated internal associates based upon estimates of the percentage of time they spent on the project in fiscal 2014  only associates that were dedicated full time to the project are included in business transformation project costs additional contributors to the decreases include an increased level of capitalization on amounts spent for system improvements to enhance stability and scalability and reduced level of spend with consultants as compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2013  the decrease in fiscal 2014  was partially offset by an increase  in depreciation and amortization expense related to the business transformation project of 107 million  in fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  

our cost per case decreased 010  per case in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  our adjusted cost per case calculated on a nongaap basis decreased 006  in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas and lower retirementrelated expenses partially offset by increased costs from delivery payrelated expenses more information on the rationale for the use of adjusted operating expenses and adjusted cost per case and reconciliations can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

certain items within operating expenses 

  

our significant certain items applicable for fiscal 2014  included costs in connection with the then proposed merger with us foods a change in the estimate of our selfinsurance reserve and a liability for a settlement which were described in greater detail above our significant certain items applicable for fiscal 2013  related to withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer pension plans severance charges and costs from restructuring executive retirement plans 

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in fiscal 2013  we recorded a provision 419 million  related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings decrease d 263  in fiscal 2015  from fiscal 2014  due primarily to the changes in operating income discussed above including the impact of certain items which included increased interest expense of 1316 million  in fiscal 2015  that related to the financing of our proposed merger with us foods these amounts include the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs when our bridge acquisition facility was terminated upon the issuance of our senior notes in october 2014 and interest expense on those senior notes excluding this interest expense adjusted interest expense decreased by 06 million  adjusted net earnings increased 663 million  or 64  during fiscal 2015  

  

net earnings for fiscal 2014   decrease d 61  compared to fiscal 2013  this decrease was primarily due to changes in operating income discussed above adjusted net earnings decreased 18  during fiscal 2014  

  

the effective tax rate of 319  for fiscal 2015  was favorably impacted by lower earnings in the us primarily due to costs associated with the termination of the us foods proposed merger the lower us earnings resulted in a more significant favorable impact on the effective tax rate from the indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings due to lower foreign statutory tax rates as compared to the domestic tax rate the additional cost associated with the proposed us foods merger resulted in lower state taxes for future periods we would expect our normalized tax rate to be in the range of 36  to 37  

  

the effective tax rate of 369  for fiscal 2014 was negatively impacted primarily by two items first a nondeductible penalty that the company incurred had an unfavorable tax impact of 62 million  second we recorded net tax expense of 52 million  for tax and interest related to various federal foreign and state uncertain tax positions this negative impact was partially offset by the recording of 57 million  of tax benefit related to disqualifying dispositions of sysco stock pursuant to sharebased compensation arrangements indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  was 359  indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory tax rates less than our domestic tax rate had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

  

earnings per share 

  

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2015  were 116  a 270   decrease  from the fiscal 2014  amount of 159  per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015  were 115  a 272   decrease  from the fiscal 2014  amount of 158  per share this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above and due to greater shares outstanding during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  as discussed below in “liquidity and capital resources  financing activities” we chose not to repurchase any shares in fiscal 2015  due to the proposed us foods merger our shares outstanding have increased primarily as a result of stock option exercises and restricted stock unit grants to employees this resulted in lowering our earnings per share amounts by 002  per share adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015  were 184  an increase of 51  from the comparable prior year period amount of 175  

  

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2014  were 159  a 54  decrease from the fiscal 2013 amount of 168  per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014  were 158  a 54  decrease from the fiscal 2013 amount of 167  per share this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014  based on the certain items definition for the fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  years were 176  a decrease of 11  from the comparable prior year period amount of 178  all earnings per share metrics for fiscal 2014  were partially impacted by a greater number of shares outstanding sysco experienced a greater number of stock option exercises in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  which increased the number of shares outstanding 

  

nongaap reconciliations and adjusted cost per case 

  

sysco’s results of operations are impacted by multiemployer pension withdrawal charges severance charges integration planning litigation costs and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods facility closure charges and us foods related financing costs additional items in fiscal 2014  include a change in estimate of selfinsurance and charges from a contingency accrual these fiscal 2015  and 2014  items are collectively referred to as certain items our us foods financing costs include the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs when our bridge acquisition facility was terminated upon the issuance of our senior notes in october 2014 and interest expense on those senior notes in fiscal 2014  costs from executive retirement plans restructuring were included within certain items however because these costs in fiscal 2015  are comparable to fiscal 2014  these were not included in the certain items definition for the comparison of adjusted results for fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2014  this continues to be presented as a certain item in the comparison of adjusted results for fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income interest expense net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove the impact of these charges provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a yearoveryear basis 

  

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the table below each period presented is adjusted to remove the costs described above in the table below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due

cost per case is an important metric management uses to measure our expense performance this metric is calculated by taking the total operating expense of our north american broadline companies divided by the number of cases sold adjusted cost per case is calculated similarly however the operating expense component excludes charges from multiemployer pension plans and severance which are the certain items applicable to these companies divided by the number of cases sold our corporate expenses are not included in the cost per cases metrics because the metric is a measure of efficiency in our operations we seek to grow our sales and either minimize or reduce our costs on a per case basis our north american broadline companies represent approximately 80  of our total sales and 75  of our total operating expenses prior to corporate expenses sysco considers adjusted cost per case to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors about syscos expense management an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 

in the table that follows the change in adjusted cost per case is reconciled to cost per case for the periods presented 

  



1  for all periods the impact of certain items excludes charges from multiemployer pension plans and severance for the fiscal 2015  comparison to fiscal 2014  our certain items charges were not significant enough to contribute a different adjusted cost per case result from the reported increase in cost per case for the fiscal 2014  comparison to fiscal 2013  the majority of the impact relates to multiemployer pension plans in the amount of 004  per case attributable to charges taken in fiscal 2014  that did not recur at the same magnitude in fiscal 2013  and the remainder relates to severance charges 

  

segment results 

  

we have aggregated our operating companies into two reporting segments broadline and sygma as defined in the accounting literature related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k intersegment sales represent specialty produce and imported specialty products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies 

  

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results corporate expenses and adjustments generally include all expenses of the corporate office and sysco’s shared service center these also include all sharebased compensation costs and integration planning litigation costs and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed us foods while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the shortterm by increases or decreases in gross profits expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

  

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with note 21 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 



the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with note 21 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 



  

1 sygma had operating income of 205 million  in fiscal 2015  380 million  in fiscal 2014  and 520 million  in fiscal 2013  

  

the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment and intersegment sales expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales including intersegment sales and operating income respectively for purposes of this statistical table operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses and adjustments of 15 billion  in fiscal 2015  10 billion  in fiscal 2014  and 8943 million  in fiscal 2013  that are not charged to our segments this information should be read in conjunction with note 21 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 



  

broadline segment 

  

the broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s usand international broadline segments located in bahamas canada costa rica and ireland broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2015  the broadline operating results represented approximately 794  of sysco’s overall sales and 943  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses 

  

there are several factors that contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segment’s earnings 

  

sales 

  

sales for fiscal 2015  were 50   higher  than fiscal 2014  sales for fiscal 2015  increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices case volume growth and sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months our case volume growth in fiscal 2015  with our locallymanaged customers was strong and corporatemanaged customer volumes increased as well sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably  impacted sales by 05  in fiscal 2015  changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 38  during fiscal 2015  driven mainly by inflation in the meat seafood and dairy categories the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively  impacted sales by 13  in fiscal 2015  

  

sales for fiscal 2014  were 43   higher  than fiscal 2013  sales for fiscal 2014  increased as a result of sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months case volume growth and product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices our sales growth in fiscal 2014  was greater with our corporatemanaged customers as compared to sales growth with our locallymanaged customers the disparity in the growth rate between these customer types moderated in the last half of fiscal 2014  with locallymanaged sales growth trending at similar rates as corporatemanaged customers sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably  impacted sales by 17  in fiscal 2014  changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 20  during fiscal 2014  driven mainly by inflation in the meat seafood and dairy categories the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively  impacted sales by 08  in fiscal 2014  

operating income 

  

fiscal 2015  vs fiscal 2014   

  

operating income increase d by 58  in fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  we experienced growth in our gross profits due to increased sales volumes stronger relative mix of sales for our locallymanaged customers and benefits from our category 

management initiative operating expenses increased from greater case volumes higher incentive accruals higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit investment in administrative support capabilities and acquired operations 

  

gross profits increased in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  and gross margins were steady increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market and volatile inflation has pressured our gross margins however sales and mix as well as our category management initiative have helped us stabilize our gross margin performance our inflation rates were higher in the first half of fiscal 2015  reaching levels of 6  at the midpoint of the fiscal year and dropping to minimal amounts by the end of the fiscal year fiscal 2015  inflation was seen primarily in the meat dairy and poultry categories 

  

operating expenses for the broadline segment increase d in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the increase in expenses for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  was driven largely by higher sales costs increased expense related to management incentive accruals and costs from companies acquired within the last 12 months partially offsetting these increases were decreases in fuel costs sales and gross profit growth partially contributed to an increase in sales payrelated expenses due to increases in sales commissions and bonuses in addition we have increased our marketing associate headcount in certain markets in order to invest in future sales growth our cost per case and adjusted cost per case increase d 004  per case in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the impact of foreign exchange rates lowered our cost per case results by 005  per case for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  which partially offset the rate of increase occurring primarily from increased payrelated expenses partially offset by lower fuel costs 

  

fiscal 2014   vs fiscal 2013   

  

operating income increase d by 28  in fiscal 2014  from fiscal 2013  this increase  was driven by operating expenses increasing more than gross profit dollars 

  

gross profit dollars increase d in fiscal 2014  primarily due to increased sales however gross profit dollars increase d at a lower rate than sales this decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased inflation increased growth from corporatemanaged customers and in part from our business transformation project initiative increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins our broadline segment experienced product cost inflation in fiscal 2014  based on our product sales mix during fiscal 2014  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories 

  

operating expenses for the broadline segment increase d in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  the expense increase s in fiscal 2014  were driven largely by charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals payrelated expenses including severance costs depreciation and amortization expense and fuel the increase in payrelated expenses was primarily due to increased delivery and warehouse compensation partially attributable to case growth and added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months delivery and warehouse compensation includes activitybased pay that will increase when our case volumes increase additionally pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology payrelated expenses our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and contributed to the increase in operating expenses depreciation and amortization increased primarily from assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2013  that were in service in fiscal 2014  primarily from new facilities property from new acquisitions and expansions 

  

in fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  we recorded provisions of 15 million  and 419 million  respectively related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 

  

our fiscal 2014  cost per case excluding charges related to withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans decrease d as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse payrelated expenses increased retirementrelated expenses and fuel increases 

  

sygma segment 

  

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products a wide variety of nonfood products and customerspecific proprietary products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

  

sales 

  

sales were 16   lower  in fiscal 2015  than in fiscal 2014  the decrease was primarily due to the resignation of several unprofitable accounts lost customers and lower fuel surcharges partially offsetting these decreases were increases from product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices and case volume increases from existing customers we expect similar sales results in fiscal 2016 due to the continued impact of these resignations as well as competitive pricing pressures sygma intends to add business with new and existing customers to profitably grow this segments results 

  

sales were 69   greater  in fiscal 2014  than in fiscal 2013  the increase was primarily due to new customers other contributors to the increase were product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices and case volume increases from existing customers 

  

operating income 

  

operating income decrease d by 461  in fiscal 2015  from fiscal 2014  gross profit dollars decrease d 33  while operating expenses increase d 73  in fiscal 2015  over fiscal 2014  gross profit dollar growth was lower primarily due to reduced fuel surcharges and lower margins as a result of the competitive market environment operating expenses increase d in fiscal 2015  largely due to increased warehouse and delivery costs including payrelated expenses partially resulting from efforts to increase driver retention and manage warehouse employee shortages operating income is expected to improve in fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  due to improved profitability from resigning less profitable customers and improved productivity 

  

operating income decrease d by 269  in fiscal 2014  from fiscal 2013  gross profit dollars increase d 28  while operating expenses increase d 65  in fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  these gross profit results largely reflect the sluggish sales environment that existed at that time operating expenses increased in fiscal 2014  largely due to increased delivery costs including payrelated expenses our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and contributed to the increase in payrelated expense 

  

other segment 

  

“other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce our customcut meat operations lodging industry products segments a company that distributes specialty imported products a company that distributes to international customers and our sysco ventures platform our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 

  

on an aggregate basis our “other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired some of the operating companies within this segment in recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry except for our lodging industry supply company each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in fiscal 2015  in the aggregate the “other” segment represented approximately 108  of sysco’s overall sales and 50  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments 

  

operating income decrease d 46  or 65 million  in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  the decrease  in operating income was largely due to startup costs from our iowa premium beef operations partially offset by increased earnings from our specialty produce and customcut meat segments 

  

operating income decrease d 22  for fiscal 2014  over fiscal 2013  the decrease in operating income was largely due to startup costs from our sysco ventures operations partially offset by increased earnings from our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments additionally retirementrelated expenses were greater for these companies for fiscal 2014  as our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and some of these operations were not a part of prior benefit plans 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

highlights 

  

comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2014  

  

   

sources and uses of cash 

  

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

  

   

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

  

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as credit monitoring optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations as of june 27 2015  we had 51 billion  in cash and cash equivalents approximately 4  of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations this percentage is lower than previous years because of proceeds from our senior notes offering which we borrowed to fund the then proposed us foods merger since the senior notes were redeemed subsequent to june 27 2015  due to the termination of the merger agreement we would expect this percentage to return to historical levels such as 32  which was the percentage as of june 28 2014  if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations however we do not currently anticipate the need to repatriate this cash 

  

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

   

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary 

cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

fiscal 2015  vs fiscal 2014   

  

we generated 16 billion  in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2015  as compared to 15 billion  in fiscal 2014  this increase of 627 million  or 42  was largely attributable to favorable comparisons on accrued expenses partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on the cash impact of our certain items that increased 1489 million yearoveryear other unfavorable comparisons were a decrease in other longterm liabilities and the impact of timing for pension contributions as well as increased working capital needs 

  

included in the change in accrued expenses was a favorable  comparison of incentive accruals due to better performance against incentive targets in fiscal 2015  our certain items increased primarily from integration planning litigation and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with us foods our merger termination fees of 3125 million  payable to us foods and pfg were accrued as of june 27 2015  and were paid in the july 2015 

included in the change in other longterm liabilities was a negative comparison on pension expense and contributions which contributed 904 million  to the unfavorable  comparison on cash flow from operations for fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2014  pension income was 153 million  and pension contributions were 751 million  including a 50 million  contribution to our retirement plan in fiscal 2015  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities pension expense was 48 million  and pension contributions were 248 million  in fiscal 2014  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities 

  

changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable had a net unfavorable  comparison of 250 million  on the comparison of cash flow from operations for fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2014  there was a favorable comparison on inventory and accounts receivable which was partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on accounts payable accounts receivable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales however the level of increase in fiscal 2015  was less than fiscal 2014  due to improved collection efforts inventory increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales however inventory turnover improved in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  accounts payable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales the yearoveryear impact of the change in accounts payable is unfavorable to cash flow from operations due to working capital improvements that were at a greater magnitude in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2015  

fiscal 2014  vs fiscal 2013   

  

we generated 149 billion  in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2014  as compared to 151 billion  in fiscal 2013  the decrease of 188 million  or 12  was largely attributable to a negative comparison on pension expense and contributions reduced net earnings a negative comparison on multiemployer pension withdrawal provisions and payments and an unfavorable comparison on prepaid expenses partially offsetting these unfavorable comparisons was a favorable comparison on working capital several significant accruals in fiscal 2014  and an increase in noncash depreciation and amortization 

                included in the change in other longterm liabilities was a negative comparison on pension expense and contributions which contributed 65 million  to the unfavorable comparison on cash flow from operations for fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  pension expense was 48 million  and pension contributions were 248 million  in fiscal 2014  which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities pension expense was 1383 million  and pension contributions were 936 million  in fiscal 2013  which resulted in an increase to other longterm liabilities 

               included in the change in accrued expenses was a negative comparison of 494 million  on multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments fiscal 2014  included a provision for multiemployer pension withdrawal of 15 million  and payments of 408 million  which resulted in a decrease to accrued expenses fiscal 2013  included a provision for multiemployer pension withdrawal of 419 million  and payments of 318 million  which resulted in an increase to accrued expenses partially offsetting the unfavorable impact of the multiemployer accrual comparison were several significant accruals unique to fiscal 2014  which contributed 485 million  to cash flow from operations for fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  

              changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable had a favorable comparison of 1297 million  on the comparison of cash flow from operations for fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  there was a favorable comparison on accounts payable which was partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on accounts receivable and inventory accounts receivable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales our sales growth in fiscal 2014  was greater with our corporatemanaged customers and payment terms for these types of customers are traditionally longer than average this mix of longerterm 

receivables contributed to the unfavorable comparison on cash flow from fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  inventory increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales however inventory turnover improved in fiscal 2014  as compared to a deterioration of inventory turnover in fiscal 2013  due to working capital improvements in inventory fiscal 2014  also included an increase in inventory in transit which offset the favorable comparison due to working capital improvements resulting in an overall unfavorable comparison on cash flow from fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2013  accounts payable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales the yearoveryear impact of the change in accounts payable is favorable to cash flow from operations due to working capital improvements in accounts payable as well as an increase in fiscal 2014  in accounts payable related to inventory in transit 

investing activities 

  

fiscal 2015  capital expenditures included 

   

fiscal 2014  capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2013  capital expenditures included 

 

the level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2015  was mostly consistent with fiscal 2014  representing a small increase of 196 million  capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  increased by 113 million  from fiscal 2013  capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  and 2013  for our business transformation project were 334 million  and 200 million  respectively 

  

we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2016  should be in the range of 550 million  to 600 million  fiscal 2016  expenditures will include facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions new facility construction including foldout facilities and investments in technology 

  

during fiscal 2015  in the aggregate the company paid cash of 1159 million  for operations acquired during fiscal 2015  and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2015  we acquired for cash a broadline company in ontario canada a joint venture interest in a foodservice distribution company in mexico a joint venture interest in a foodservice distribution company in costa rica and a specialty seafood company in new jersey 

  

during fiscal 2014  in the aggregate the company paid cash of 793 million  for operations acquired during fiscal 2014  and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2014 we acquired for cash a specialty meat company in maryland and broadline operations in missouri ohio and philadelphia 

during fiscal 2013  in the aggregate the company paid cash of 3974 million  for operations acquired during fiscal 2013  and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2013  we acquired for cash broadline operations in bahamas california ohio quebec canada northern ireland specialty seafood companies in ontario canada florida and houston specialty produce in ireland and our sysco ventures startup in california 

  

free cash flow 

  

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash 

including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions however free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments as a result of increased cash provided by operating activities partially offset by increased capital spending and decreased proceeds from sales of plant and equipment free cash flow for fiscal 2015  increased 42  or 417 million  to 10 billion  as compared to fiscal 2014  increased cash provided by operating activities partially offset by increased capital spending resulted in free cash flow for fiscal 2014  decreasing 20  or 199 million  to 9954 million  as compared to fiscal 2013  

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap in the table that follows free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 





  

financing activities 

  

equity transactions 

  

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 2402 million  in fiscal 2015  2556 million  in fiscal 2014  and 6287 million  in fiscal 2013  the level of proceeds in each year is directly related to the number of options exercised in each year the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 

  

we traditionally have engaged in boardapproved share repurchase programs no shares were acquired in fiscal 2015  due to the proposed us foods merger the number of shares acquired and their cost during 2014  and 2013  were 10059000  shares for 3324 million  in fiscal 2014  and 21672403  shares for 7216 million  in fiscal 2013  no additional shares were repurchased through august 13 2015 resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 11655197 shares from a repurchase program that expired on august 23 2015  in june 2015 our board of directors approved a repurchase program to repurchase from time to time in the open market through an accelerated share repurchase program or through privately negotiated transactions shares of the companys common stock in an amount not to exceed 30 billion  during the two  year period ending july 1 2017  including 15 billion through a planned accelerated share repurchase in fiscal 2016 in addition to amounts normally repurchased to offset benefit plan and stock option dilution in addition to the share repurchase program approved in june in august 2015  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 20000000  shares for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed 800 million  the authorization expires on august 21 2017  beyond our 30 billion share repurchase program  approved in june 2015 our share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our average shares outstanding relatively constant over time the number of shares we repurchase in fiscal 2016  will be dependent on many factors including the level of future stock option exercises as well as competing uses for available cash 

  

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception over 40 years ago we target a dividend payout of 40  to 50  of net earnings we paid in excess of that range in fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  primarily due to increased expenses from our certain items dividends paid were 6953 million  or 117  per share in fiscal 2015  6672 million  or 114  per share in fiscal 2014  and 6483 million  or 110  per share in fiscal 2013  in may 2015  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2016  of 030  per share which was paid in july 2015  

  

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 13 2015  29477835  shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

  

debt activity and borrowing availability 

our debt activity including issuances and repayments and our borrowing availability is described in note 11 “debt and other financing arrangements” our outstanding borrowings at june 27 2015 and repayment activity since the close of fiscal 2015 are disclosed within that note updated amounts through august 13 2015  include 

 

our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 054  for fiscal 2015  and 016  for each of fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  we intend to file with the sec an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities and guarantees of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 

  

other considerations 

  

multiemployer plans 

  

our exposure to multiemployer defined benefit plans is discussed in note 15 “multiemployer employee benefit plans” including our estimate of our share of withdrawal liability for these plans an update of this amount through august 13 2015  based on the latest available information is unchanged from the amount disclosed in note 15 

  

potential contingencies impacting liquidity 

  

certain tax jurisdictions require partial to full payment on audit assessments or the posting of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process sysco has posted approximately 90 million  in letters of credit representing a partial payment of the audit assessments in order to appeal the canadian revenue authority assessments of transfer pricing adjustments relating to our cross border procurement activities through our former purchasing cooperative on our fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2009 fiscal years we are protesting these adjustments through appeals we could have to pay cash or post additional letters of credit of as much as 160 million  in order to appeal these assessments 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

contractual obligations     

  

the following table sets forth as of june 27 2015  certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 



  

1 the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement ages and payout periods 

2 the estimated contributions through fiscal 2024 to meet erisa minimum funding requirements based on actuarial assumptions include the extension of funding relief included in the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 

3 includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2025 based on actuarial assumptions 

4 unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions as of june 27 2015  we had a liability of 375 million  for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and 334 million  for related interest that could result in cash payment we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of noncurrent payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time accordingly the related noncurrent balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 

  

5 includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june 27 2015  assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates the impact of our outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june 27 2015  

6 for purposes of this table purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed including minimum quantities resulting from our category management initiative as we progress with this initiative our purchase obligations are increasing such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third party service providers to provide information technology services for period up to fiscal 2019 see discussion under note 20 “commitments and contingencies” to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 and fixed fuel purchase commitments purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 

  

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 27 2015 were 39 million  this amount is not included in the table above 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods in these instances a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

  

selfinsurance program 

  

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

  

companysponsored pension plans 

  

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our retirement plan was frozen in fiscal 2013 and is only open to a small number of employees our serp was frozen in fiscal 2013 due to these plan freezes our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is no longer a critical assumption 

  

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 2015  net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 28 2014  measurement date decreased 58  basis points to 474  the discount rate for determining fiscal 2015  net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 28 2014  measurement date decreased 35  basis points to 459  the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2015  by an estimated 7 million  the discount rate for determining fiscal 2016  net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 27 2015  measurement date increased 10  basis points to 484  the discount rate for determining fiscal 2016 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 27 2015  measurement date increased 4  basis points to 463  the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2016 by an estimated 1 million  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rates for fiscal 2015 would decrease or increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by approximately 11 million  now that sysco’s pension plans are frozen net companysponsored pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to when these plans were active 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 775  for fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset 

class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 83  63  111  and 77  over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2014  respectively in addition in seven  of the last 15  years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10  the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

  

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 725  for fiscal 2016  a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2015 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2015  by approximately 30 million  

  

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 27 2015  was a charge net of tax of 7053 million  the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 28 2014  was a charge net of tax of 6860 million  

  

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of 751 million  and 248 million  in fiscal years 2015  and 2014  respectively our contributions in fiscal 2015 include a 500 million  contribution to the retirement plan that was voluntary as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2014  plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements there was no contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal 2014  as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2013  plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements there are no required contributions to the retirement plan to meet erisa minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2016  the estimated fiscal 2016  contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately 28 million  

  

income taxes 

  

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

  

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

  

vendor consideration 

  

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in some instances vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities we calculate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold our inventory turnover is usually less than one month therefore amounts deferred against inventory do not require longterm estimation in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized historically adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

  

in addition annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our 13  operating segments as described in note 21 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the components within each of our 13  operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into 13  reporting units 

  

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our 13  operating segments we primarily use a 60  weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and 40  for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

  

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2014  and 2013  have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2015  assessment our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis however we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our costa rican broadline and european broadline reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by 14  to 15  respectively as of june 27 2015  these reporting units had goodwill aggregating 2182 million  for the remainder of our reporting units which as of june 27 2015  had goodwill aggregating 18 billion  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value of these reporting units had declined by greater than 25  

  

certain reporting units caribbean broadline european broadline specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products imported specialty products international distribution operations and our sysco ventures platform have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the us broadline reporting unit as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans a nonemployee director plan and the employees’ stock purchase plan 

  

as of june 27 2015  there was 694 million  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 242  years 

  

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 

separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 

  

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

  

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or nonemployee directors is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

  

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

  

our sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

  

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

  

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

  

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates forwardlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact forwardlooking statements can also be identified by words such as “future” “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “expects” “intends” “plans” “predicts” “will” “would” “could” “can” “may” and similar terms forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in part i item 1a of this form 10k under the heading “risk factors” which are incorporated herein by reference 

  

in addition to the risk factors discussed in part i item 1a of this form 10k the success of sysco’s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs our expectations regarding cost per case may be impacted by factors beyond our control including actions by our competitors andor customers companysponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings available cash and the success of our various strategic initiatives our expectations regarding earnings per share and various items impacting earnings is subject to a number of factors including our ability to manage operating expenses and the impact of certain items our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to our other strategic initiatives the allocation of resources and plans and economic 

conditions generally legal proceedings and the adequacy of insurance are impacted by events circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by various factors including capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated levels of stock repurchases or other unexpected cash requirements plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on management’s assessment of the overall needs of the company capital expenditures may vary from those projected based on changes in business plans and other factors including risks related to the timing and successful completions of acquisitions construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending our ability to finance capital expenditures as anticipated may be influenced by our results of operations our borrowing capacity share repurchases dividend levels and other factors expectations regarding tax rates and the transfer of cash held in foreign jurisdictions are subject to various factors beyond our control and decisions of management throughout the fiscal year that are subject to change based on syscos business needs the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect and laws and regulations as well as methods of enforcement are subject to change 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

  

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

  

fiscal   2015   

  

as of june 27 2015  we had no commercial paper outstanding total debt as of june 27 2015  was 73 billion  of which approximately 74  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement included in the total debt amount is 50 billion  in senior notes that were issued in october 2014  for the proposed merger with us foods the october 2014 senior notes contained mandatory redemption features providing that on the earlier of the merger agreement termination date or october 8 2015  we were required to redeem all of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 101  of the principal of the senior notes plus accrued interest in june 2015 we terminated the merger agreement and redeemed the senior notes in july 2015 using cash on hand and the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper facility 

  

in august 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 5000 million  of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2018 to floating rate debt in october 2014 we also entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted 5000 million  of the new senior notes maturing on october 2 2017 and 7500 million  of the new senior notes maturing on october 2 2019 to floating rate debt 2014 swaps these transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the change in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

our 2014 swaps were terminated in july 2015 details of our outstanding swap agreements at june 27 2015 are below 



in january 2014  in contemplation of securing financing and hedging interest rate risk relating to our assumption or refinancing of the net debt of us foods that was scheduled to occur upon closing of the proposed merger discussed in note 4 “acquisitions” we entered into two forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 20 billion  we designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on 10 year and 30 year debt issued in fiscal 2015 in september 2014 in conjunction with the pricing of the 125 billion  senior notes maturing on october 2 2024 and 1 billion  senior notes maturing october 2 2044 we terminated these swaps locking in the effective yields on the related debt cash of 589 million  was paid to settle the 10 year swap in september 2014 and cash of 1299 million  was paid to settle the 30 year swap in october 2014 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of june 27 2015  all amounts are stated in united states us dollar equivalents

in august 2015 the company entered into two  forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 500 million the company designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce interest rate exposure on forecasted 10 year debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates for debt the company expects to issue in fiscal 2016 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively  impacted sales by 10  in fiscal 2015  when compared to fiscal 2014  the exchange rate used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively  impacted sales by 07  in fiscal 2014  when compared to fiscal 2013  the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014  a 10  unfavorable change in the fiscal 2015  weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2015  sales by 12  and would not have materially impacted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

fuel price risk 

  

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2015  fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 06  of sales for fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  these costs represented approximately 07  of sales 

  

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include routing optimization with the goal of reducing miles driven improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 27 2015  we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 993 million  through june 2016 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 40  to 45  of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10  unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of approximately 15 million  in our fuel costs on our noncontracted volumes 

  

investment risk 

  

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in public and private equity fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10  unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plan at the plan’s fiscal year end december 31 2014 would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2016  however this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2016  by 310 million  and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 27 2015  by 3003 million

proposed merger with us foods 

  

in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 sysco announced an agreement to merge with us foods inc us foods us foods is a leading foodservice distributor in the united states us that markets and distributes fresh frozen and dry food and nonfood products to more than 200000 foodservice customers including independently owned single location restaurants regional and national chain restaurants healthcare and educational institutions hotels and motels government and military organizations and retail locations following the completion of the proposed merger the combined company will continue to be named sysco and headquartered in houston texas 

  

as of the time the merger agreement was announced in december 2013 sysco agreed to pay approximately 35 billion for the equity of us foods comprised of 3 billion of sysco common stock and 500 million of cash as part of the transaction sysco will also assume or refinance us foods’ net debt which was approximately 47 billion as of september 28 2013 bringing the total enterprise value to 82 billion at the time of the merger announcement as of august 13 2014 the merger consideration is estimated as follows approximately 37 billion for the equity of us foods comprised of 32 billion of sysco common stock valued using the seven day average through august 13 2014 and 500 million of cash us foods net debt to be assumed or refinanced was approximately 48 billion as of june 28 2014 bringing the total enterprise value to 85 billion as of august 13 2014 the value of sysco’s common stock and the amount of us foods’ net debt will fluctuate as such the components of the transaction and total enterprise value noted above will not be finalized until the merger is consummated 

  

we have secured a fully committed bridge financing and expect to issue longerterm financing prior to closing after completion of the transaction the equity holders of us foods will own approximately 87 million shares or roughly 13 of sysco a representative from each of us foods’ two majority shareholders will join sysco’s board of directors upon closing this merger is currently pending a regulatory review process by the federal trade commission we expect the transaction to close by the end of the third quarter or in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 under certain conditions including lack of regulatory approval sysco would be obligated to pay 300 million to the owners of us foods if the merger were cancelled which would be recognized as an expense

1 sales are less than 1 of total for years shown with a ““ 

  

our distribution centers which we refer to as operating companies distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

  

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through our approximately 12800 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution 

 

such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

  

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended june 28 2014 

  

w e estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  

  



  

  1 other includes cafeterias that are not stand alone restaurants bakeries caterers churches civic and fraternal organizations vending distributors other distributors and international exports none of these types of customers as a group exceeded 5 of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented 

  

sources of supply 

  

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

  

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers this includes the construction and operation of regional distribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region currently we have two rdcs in operation one in virginia and one in florida 

  

working capital practices 

  

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources” at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

  

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

  

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

  

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

  

corporate headquarters and shared services center

capital improvements 

  

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to modernize expand and construct new distribution facilities during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately 5232 million 5119 million and 7845 million respectively were invested in delivery fleet facilities technology and other capital asset enhancements from time to time we dispose of assets in the normal course of business we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets were 4974 million 4963 million and 7763 million respectively we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2015 should be in the range of 500 million to 550 million during the three years ended june 28 2014 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2015 capital expenditures from the same sources 

  

employees 

  

as of june 28 2014 we had approximately 50300 fulltime employees approximately 17 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 21 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that have expired or will expire during fiscal 2015 and are subject to renegotiation since june 28 2014 there have been no contract renegotiations we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

  

competition 

  

industry sources estimate that there are more than 15000 companies engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry in the us our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets including club cash and carry and grocery stores or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers online retailers and ecommerce companies are also participants in the foodservice industry while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors some organizations compete with us on a multiregion basis in addition these local regional and multiregional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently product needs service requirements and price are just a few of the factors they evaluate when deciding where to purchase customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce meat or seafood other wholesale channels club stores cash and carry stores grocery stores and numerous online retailers since switching costs are very low customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly there are few barriers to market entry existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers 

  

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the us and canada and estimate that we serve about 174 of this approximately 255 billion annual market based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2013 we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the us and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2014 while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our more than 7000 marketing associates our diversified product base which includes a differentiated group of high quality sysco brand products the diversity in the types of customers we serve our economies of scale and our multiregion portfolio in the us and canada which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements we are the only distributor in the foodawayfromhome industry in the us with publicly traded equity while our public company status provides us with some advantages over many of our competitors including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that most of them do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

  

government regulation 

  

our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business in many jurisdictions compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions in general competition laws are designed to protect businesses and consumers from anticompetitive behavior 

 

  

in the us as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda the fda regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

  

we and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

  

we are also subject to regulation by numerous federal state and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor which sets employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation which regulates transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies in addition we are also subject to the us false claims act and similar state statutes which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments 

  

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized we have implemented and continue to develop a robust anticorruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anticorruption laws in countries where we operate 

  

outside the us our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations as well as other legal and regulatory requirements 

  

all of our companys facilities and other operations in the us and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater further most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements we are subject to other federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials however these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

  

general 

  

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco ® trademark and our privatelybranded product trademarks that include the sysco ® trademark these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry approximately half of our privatelybranded sales are from products labeled with our sysco ® trademark without any other trademark we believe the loss of the sysco ® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our us trademarks are effective for a tenyear period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use the company does not have any material patents or licenses 

  

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

  

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

  

 

as of june 28 2014 we operated 194 distribution facilities throughout the us bahamas canada republic of ireland and northern ireland 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified on page 48 and from historical trends 

  

mergerrelated risks 

  

the closing and consummation of the merger with us foods inc us foods is subject to regulatory approval and the satisfaction of certain conditions and we cannot predict whether the necessary conditions will be satisfied or waived and the requisite regulatory approvals received 

  

the completion of the merger with us foods is subject to regulatory approvals including antitrust approval and customary conditions including without limitation 

  















  

sysco and us foods may fail to secure the requisite approvals in a timely manner or on terms desired or anticipated and the merger with us foods may not close in the anticipated time frame if at all sysco has no control over certain conditions in the merger agreement and cannot predict whether such conditions will be satisfied or waived regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the transaction such conditions or changes may prevent the closing of the merger or cause the merger to be delayed and delays may cause sysco to incur additional potentially burdensome transaction costs 

  

sysco and us foods may be required to accept certain remedies in order to obtain regulatory approval for the merger and any such remedies could reduce the projected benefits of the merger and negatively impact the combined company 

  

the imposition of remedies as a condition to obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction could limit the revenues of the combined company and negatively impact the combined company the potential remedies may negatively impact the projected benefits of the proposed merger along with the business financial condition and competitiveness of sysco as the combined company even if regulatory approval for the merger is obtained any remedies could result in the total revenues of the combined postmerger entity being less than the combined historical revenues of sysco and us foods 

  

termination of the merger agreement or failure to consummate the merger with us foods could adversely impact sysco and under certain conditions could require sysco to make a termination payment of 300 million which could adversely impact sysco’s stock price and would adversely impact sysco’s liquidity and financial condition 

  

the merger agreement contains certain termination rights including the right of either party to terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not occurred by march 8 2015 subject to extension under certain circumstances furthermore if the merger agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain required antitrust approvals in certain circumstances sysco will be required to pay us foods a termination fee of 300 million the payment of such fee would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition in addition if the merger agreement is terminated we may suffer other negative consequences our business may be negatively impacted by our management having focused its attention on acquiring us foods instead of pursuing other advantageous business opportunities or plans furthermore we will incur substantial expenses and costs related to the merger whether or not it is consummated including legal accounting and advisory fees also failure to consummate the merger may result in negative market reactions and may have an adverse impact on sysco’s stock price and future financial results 

  

 

business uncertainties during the pendency of the proposed merger may adversely impact our current business operations and relationships with employees vendors and customers 

  

prospective suppliers customers or other third parties may delay or decline to enter into agreements with us as a result of the uncertainties surrounding the proposed merger and we may also lose current suppliers and customers as a result of these uncertainties furthermore uncertainties as to the effect of the merger transaction may adversely impact employee morale and impede our ability to retain key employees the loss of key employees or unionrelated work stoppages could impact our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of sysco and us foods and fully realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

  

the pending merger and our current premerger integration planning efforts may divert resources from sysco’s daytoday operations and ongoing efforts related to other strategies and initiatives 

  

the pending merger and our current premerger integration planning efforts may divert our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives including the initiatives related to our business transformation project which has and will continue to require a substantial amount of resources the diversion of management attention from ongoing business operations and strategic efforts could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact sysco’s business and operations 

  

the integration of the businesses of sysco and us foods may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the merger may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies 

  

the success of the merger between sysco and us foods including the realization of the anticipated benefits will depend in part on the ability of sysco as the combined company to successfully integrate the businesses of sysco and us foods failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the merger including cost synergies stemming from supply chain efficiencies merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions 

  

the integration of two large independent companies will be complex and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate sysco’s and us foods’ business practices policies cultures and operations this diversion of our management’s attention from daytoday business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives including the initiatives related to our business transformation project could result in performance shortfalls which could adversely impact the combined company’s business operations and financial results the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees which could adversely impact the combined company’s future financial results 

  

furthermore during the integration planning process and after the closing of the merger we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties including those related to without limitation managing a larger combined company streamlining supply chains consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations retaining our existing vendors and customers unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the merger or us foods’ business delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business financial condition and operations of the combined company 

  

we may not be able to retain some of us foods’ vendors and customers after the proposed merger which could negatively impact the anticipated benefits of the merger 

  

us foods’ vendors or customers may have termination rights that are triggered upon completion of the merger and such vendors or customers may decide to not renew their existing relationship with us and may instead select one of our competitors if we are unable to retain and maintain these vendor and customer relationships then the business financial condition and operations of sysco as the combined company could be adversely impacted 

  

consummation of the merger will require sysco to incur significant additional indebtedness which could adversely impact our financial condition and may hinder our ability to obtain additional financing and pursue other business and investment opportunities 

  

in connection with the merger sysco will assume or refinance all of us foods’ outstanding debt which was approximately  48 billion as of june 28 2014 any refinancing of us foods’ indebtedness is expected to be financed with a combination of new debt and cash on sysco’s balance sheet sysco has secured fully committed bridge financing 

  

incurrence of additional indebtedness could have negative consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and implement and pursue strategic initiatives and opportunities additionally if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger with us foods or if the financial performance of sysco as the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service the debt will be adversely impacted our credit ratings may also be impacted as a result of the incurrence of additional acquisitionrelated indebtedness currently certain credit rating agencies have put us on watch for a potential downgrade 

  

 

the merger will dilute the ownership interests of sysco’s existing stockholders  

  

at the time of the consummation of the proposed merger sysco will issue approximately 87 million shares or roughly 13 of sysco’s outstanding common stock after the transaction is completed as a result the ownership amounts of sysco’s premerger stockholders will be diluted generally dilution will impact a stockholder’s ownership percentage and ability to influence voting results and will likely reduce earnings per share which could impact stock price 

  

industry and general economic risks 

  

periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability    

  

volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may negatively impact our business due to the timing needed to pass on such increases the impact of such inflation on discretionary spending by consumers and our limited ability to increase prices in the current highly competitive environment conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

  

our results of operations and financial condition may be directly adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in the us economy and local markets as well as negative trends in consumer confidence 

  

the foodservice distribution industry which is characterized by relatively low profit margins with limited demand growth expected in the nearterm is especially susceptible to negative trends and economic uncertainty the united states us has experienced an uneven economic environment over the past several years despite job growth experiencing a positive trend it has yet to translate into a significant impact on overall unemployment the housing segment is struggling to maintain consistent positive trends and this segment historically has been a key driver of economic growth these factors indicate that consumer disposable income is increasing modestly in addition our results of operations are substantially affected by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market the difficult economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

  









  

the uncertainty in the economic environment has adversely affected the rate of improvement in both business and consumer confidence and spending and uncertainty about the longterm investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity     

  

competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers and makes it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability  

  

the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and highly competitive with local regional multiregional distributors and specialty competitors furthermore barriers to entry by new competitors or geographic or product line expansion by existing competitors are low additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures and group purchasing organizations have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability finally demand for foodawayfromhome products is volatile and price sensitive imposing limits on our customers’ ability to absorb cost increases new and increased competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting such competition or other industry pressures may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

  

although our sales historically have grown faster than the market industry growth rates have slowed over the past several years and industry sources expect the lower growth rates to continue in the nearterm these trends have placed pressure on our profit margins and made it more difficult to leverage our cost structure and pass along cost increases we expect these trends to continue for 

 

the foreseeable future if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our market share sales and profitability through increased expenditures or decreased prices could be adversely impacted 

  

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and forward purchase commitments intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs    

  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry we require significant quantities of fuel for our delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with fluctuations in the market price for fuel the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environmental concerns on average onhighway diesel fuel prices decreased approximately 1 in fiscal 2014 and increased approximately 2 in 2013 respectively as compared to the prior year the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so in the future if fuel costs increase further in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the thencurrent forward price for diesel if fuel prices decrease significantly these forward purchases may prove ineffective and result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel 

  

business and operational risks 

  

our ability to meet our longterm strategic objectives to grow the profitability of our business depends largely on the success of the business transformation project    

  

our multiyear business transformation project consists of 

  







  

successfully managing deployment is critical to our business success while we expect all of the components of the business transformation project to enhance our value proposition to customers and suppliers and improve our longterm profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established if at all 

  

the actual cost of the erp system may be greater than currently expected and continued delays in the execution of deployment may adversely affect our business and results of operations  

  

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multiyear timeframe our cost estimates related to our erp system are based on assumptions which are subject to wide variability require a great deal of judgment and are inherently uncertain thus the actual costs of the project in fiscal 2015 and beyond may be greater than currently expected we have encountered and we may continue to encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget including incurring expenses at an earlier or later time than currently anticipated for example we deployed our erp system to five additional locations in fiscal 2014 and are continuing to experience improved functionality in many areas compared to past deployments however while the majority of the system functionality is performing as designed we have continued to identify issues that we want to address before we continue deploying to additional locations 

  

in addition implementation of the erp system requires significant management attention and resources over an extended period of time and any significant design errors or delays in the implementation of the systems could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition because the implementation is expected to continue to involve a significant financial commitment our business results of operations and liquidity may also be adversely affected if the erp system and the associated process changes do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate there can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize the intended results of the system software and implementation activities 

  

we may not realize anticipated benefits from our operating cost reduction efforts  

  

we have implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives that we believe are necessary to position our business for future success and growth our future success and earnings growth will be significantly impacted by our ability to achieve a lower cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity and low growth rates a variety of factors could cause us not to realize some of the expected cost savings 

 

including among other things delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings initiatives lack of sustainability in cost savings over time and unexpected costs associated with operating our business if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease furthermore even if we realize the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction efforts we may experience an adverse impact on our employees customers and suppliers which could negatively affect our sales and profits 

  

we may not realize the full anticipated benefits from our category management initiative 

  

we are in the midst of deploying our category management initiative which encompasses a rigorous process whereby we use market data and customer insights to optimize the product assortment available to our customers strengthen strategic relationships with our suppliers drive product innovation and increase our sales and profit margins if our sales associates are not able to effectively gain acceptance of the new product assortment from our customers or are not able to absorb the significant administrative and process changes required then we may not be able to successfully execute the category management initiative in the timeline we anticipate and we may not capture all of the financial and other benefits that we anticipate 

  

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs  

  

we obtain substantially all of ou r foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us however we believe the number of longterm contracts will increase as we progress with our category management initiative although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop and other agricultural conditions water shortages transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

  

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings    

  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products the sysco brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or the public’s confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety sustainability or integrity of our products or relating to activities by our operations employees suppliers or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand  and could adversely affect our revenues and profits 

  

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis salmonella listeria or swine flu and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact the public’s confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically 

  

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation will have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

 

if sales to our locallymanaged customers grow at a lower rate than sales to our corporatemanaged customers our operating margins may decline and our corporatemanaged customers will increase their proportion of our total sales thus subjecting us to greater risk if we lose one or more of these customers and possibly enabling these larger customers to exert greater pressure on us to reduce our prices andor expand our services  

  

our sales to corporatemanaged customers have generally grown at a faster rate than our sales to locallymanaged locations gross margin from our corporatemanaged customers is generally lower than that of our locallymanaged customers because we typically sell higher volumes of products to these customers and provide a relatively lower level of valueadded services than we do to locallymanaged customers if sales to our locallymanaged customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our corporatemanaged customers our operating margins may decline 

  

moreover if sales to our corporatemanaged customers increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our locallymanaged customers we will become more dependent on corporatemanaged customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales additionally the loss of sales to the larger of these corporatemanaged customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers we could be pressured by them to lower our prices andor offer expanded or additional services at the same prices in that event we would need to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions andor cost increases or our gross margins and profitability could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

  

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful    

  

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets and the establishment of international procurement organizations our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations thereof may have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations 

  

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

  

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business    

  

we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business such as food safety and sanitation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 

  

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting seizures or debarments from contracting with the government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

  

 

product liability claims could materially impact our business  

  

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

  

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively  

  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely impacted integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debttoequity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments see “ the integration of the businesses of sysco and us foods may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the merger may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits including cost synergies ” 

  

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on cash flow and liquidity  

  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock see “ consummation of the merger will require sysco to incur significant additional indebtedness which could adversely impact our financial condition and may hinder our ability to obtain additional financing and pursue other business and investment opportunities” 

  

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position  

  

as of june 28 2014 we had approximately 3 bil lion of total indebtedness we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billi on a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs in the amount of 15 b illion set to expire on december 29 2018 certain uncommitted bank lines of credit providing for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to  950 milli on and a €1000 million euro multicurrency revolving credit facility for use by our irish subsidiary set to expire september 24 2014 which is subject to extension  our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of capital and financial results in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations see “ consummation of the merger will require sysco to incur significant additional indebtedness which could adversely impact our financial condition and may hinder our ability to obtain additional financing and pursue other business and investment opportunities” 

  

our liquidity can be negatively impacted by payments required to appeal tax assessments with certain tax jurisdictions  

  

certain tax jurisdictions require partial to full payment of audit assessments or the posting of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process sysco has posted approximately 325 m illion in letters of credit in order to appeal the canadian revenue agency assessments of transfer pricing adjustments relating to our cross border procurement activities through our former purchasing cooperative on our 2004 and 2005 fiscal years if assessed on later years currently under examination   using these same positions we could have to pay cash or post additional letters of credit of as much as 1290 million in order to appeal these further assessments if significant further payments are required the c ompany’s financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

 

we rely on technology in our business and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could have a material negative impact on our business    

  

  our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits 

  

furthermore process changes will be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing delivery and payroll systems to support operations as we implement the erp system while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits 

  

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers    

  

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

  

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans  

  

  we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 10 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2014 our total contributions to these plans were approxim ately 76 million which included payments for withdrawal liabilities of 41 million  the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years  the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiempl oyer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit  based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 245 mill ion as of june 28 2014 a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines  

  

at the end of fiscal 2012 we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan  retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation o f 32 bi llion as of june 28 2014 therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements although recent pension funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions that provided the relief are phased out see note 14  “companysponsored employee benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the retirement plan 

  

 

the amount of our annual contribution to the retirement plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the retirement plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability our retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the retirement plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse impact on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 

  

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages  

  

as of june 28 2014 approximately 88 00 employees at 52 operating companies were members of 59 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2015 13   agreements covering approximately 1900   emp loyees have expired or will expire since june 28 2014 there have been no contract renegotiations  failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings  

  

the future success of our operations including the achievement of our strategic objectives depends on our ability to identify recruit develop and retain qualified and talented individuals and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our employee recruitment development and retention efforts may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers and achieve our strategic objectives such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

  

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders  

  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a yearoveryear basis other than free cash flow any nongaap financial measure will be denoted as an adjusted measure and exclude the impact from executive retirement plans restructuring multiemployer pension withdrawals severance charges merger and integration costs associated with our pending us foods inc us foods merger change in estimate for selfinsurance costs charges from a liability for a settlement facility closure charges amortization of us foods financing costs and an acquisition related charge specific to fiscal 2013 collectively defined as certain items the comparison of our fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 periods also excludes the impact of our business transformation project more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

due to the inherent uncertainties concerning the impact of the pending us foods acquisition see discussion in risk factors in part 1 item 1a it is impracticable for us to provide projections that fully anticipate all possible impacts of the acquisition for that reason forwardlooking disclosures in this mda and elsewhere describe anticipated future trends and results of only our current operations excluding any potential impact from the us foods acquisition unless specifically noted 

  

overview 

  

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are primarily located throughout the united states us bahamas canada republic of ireland and northern ireland and include broadline companies which include our customcut meat operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary specialty produce companies hotel supply operations a company that distributes specialty imported products a company that distributes to international customers and our sysco ventures platform our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers 

  

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the us canada and ireland and estimate that we serve about 174 of this approximately 255 billion annual market based on a measurement as of the end of calendar 2013 we use industry data obtained from various sources including technomic inc the canadian restaurant and foodservices association and the irish food board to calculate this measurement industry sources adjust measurements of the market size periodically to align with governmental census data as a result our measurement used for calendar 2012 was adjusted to 171 according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 48 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the us as of the end of calendar 2013 

  

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the us experienced a real sales increase of approximately 11 in calendar year 2013 and 12 in calendar year 2012 real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

  

highlights 

  

the foodservice industry remained under pressure in fiscal 2014 while the economy continues to slowly recover the magnitude of recovery is modest and the outlook for certain fundamental drivers of the economy is mixed this creates a challenging business environment for us and our customers however we continue to implement transformational change on a broad scale which is enhancing the products and services we provide our customers and helping us to operate more efficiently our sales and gross profits grew modestly and our expense management performance was favorable overall despite cost pressures in our delivery operations our improvements largely resulted from our business transformation project initiatives which helped drive our north american broadline cost per case lower than in fiscal 2013 the impact of certain items also contributed to lower operating income in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 

  

comparison of results from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 

  















 

  

see “nongaap reconciliations” for an explanation of these nongaap financial measures 

  

in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced an agreement to merge with us foods this merger is currently pending a regulatory review process 

  

  

trends and strategy 

  

trends 

  

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales consumers continue to spend their disposable income in an increasingly disciplined manner we believe these conditions have contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market while these trends can be cyclical in nature greater consumer confidence will be required to reverse the trend according to industry sources real sales growth for the total foodservice market in the us is expected to be modest over the longterm we believe these industry trends reinforce the need for us to transform our business to reduce our overall cost structure and provide greater value to our customers our longterm sales growth expectation is 4 to 6 annually which assumes a modest rate of inflation similar to historical levels 

  

our gross margin performance has been influenced by multiple factors the modest level of growth in the foodservice market has created additional competitive pricing pressures which is in turn negatively impacting gross profits sales to our locallymanaged customers including independent restaurant customers have not grown at the same rate as sales to our corporatemanaged customers gross margin from our corporatemanaged customers is generally lower than other types of customers due to higher volumes sold to these customers our locallymanaged customers comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes and an even greater percentage of profitability because of the high level of value added services we typically provide to this customer group as a result our gross margins have declined the disparity in the growth rate between these customer types moderated in the last half of fiscal 2014 with locallymanaged sales growth trending at similar rates as corporatemanaged customers inflation can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure our inflation rates were relatively stable over the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 however it increased in the fourth quarter all quarters being compared to the past year fourth quarter fiscal 2014 inflation was seen primarily in the meat seafood and dairy categories which represent more than onethird of our annual sales while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers and inflation can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit operating income and earnings 

  

we have experienced higher operating expenses this fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2013 stemming from higher case volumes some of which is attributable to our acquired operations increased depreciation and amortization increased delivery costs and higher corporate expenses these were partially offset by lower business transformation project expenses and benefits from business transformation project initiatives we have experienced a decrease in payrelated expenses in the selling and information technology areas due to initiatives from our business transformation project the benefits in the selling and information technology areas have largely been realized and are not expected to recur in fiscal 2015 other areas of payrelated expense have increased primarily from acquired companies and within delivery areas of our business a portion of which can be attributable to volume increases our retirementrelated expenses consist primarily of costs from our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan our supplemental executive retirement plan serp and our defined contribution plan our retirement plan was substantially frozen and the serp was completely frozen in fiscal 2013 and our defined contribution plan was enhanced with greater benefits the net impact of these actions is a reduction in retirementrelated costs for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the benefits in the retirementrelated expense have largely been realized and the amount of cost decrease is not expected to recur at the same magnitude in fiscal 2015 as in fiscal 2014 corporate office expenses have risen in fiscal 2014 and will continue to rise in fiscal 2015 as we expand our corporate capabilities including a new revenue management function organizational changes that drive greater functional support in our broadline operations and additional investments in technology we have incurred additional costs in connection with the proposed merger with us foods announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily from integration planning and due diligence costs we anticipate incurring additional costs as we begin planning for integration of the two companies as well as other financing costs incurred in connection with the proposed merger the proposed merger is undergoing regulatory review by the federal trade commission and we estimate the merger will close by the end of the third quarter or in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 

  

strategy 

  

we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the us bahamas canada and ireland while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business daytoday our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service with the aspirational vision of becoming each of our customers’ most valued and trusted business partner we have identified five components of our strategy to help us achieve our mission and vision 

 

  



  



  



  



  



  

the five components of our strategy discussed above are designed to drive sustainable profitable growth increase asset optimization and free cash flow and increase operating margins consistent with these three objectives in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced an agreement to merge with us foods us foods is a leading foodservice distributor in the us that markets and distributes fresh frozen and dry food and nonfood products to more than 200000 foodservice customers including independently owned single location restaurants regional and national chain restaurants healthcare and educational institutions hotels and motels government and military organizations and retail locations following the completion of the proposed merger the combined company will continue to be named sysco and headquartered in houston texas at closing sysco is expected to have annual sales of approximately 65 billion and with successful integration we believe at least 600 million in estimated annual synergies can be obtained in the combined company over a three to four year time period expenses to achieve synergies are estimated to be 700 million to 800 million to occur over a three year time frame once the acquisition has closed we anticipate some level of capital expenditures primarily for internal use software and other computer equipment however amounts have not been estimated at this time 

  

as of the time the merger agreement was announced in december 2013 sysco agreed to pay approximately 35 billion for the equity of us foods comprised of 3 billion of sysco common stock and 500 million of cash as part of the transaction sysco will also assume or refinance us foods’ net debt which was approximately 47 billion as of september 28 2013 bringing the total enterprise value to 82 billion at the time of the merger announcement as of august 13 2014 the merger consideration is estimated as follows approximately 37 billion for the equity of us foods comprised of 32 billion of sysco common stock valued using the seven day average through august 13 2014 and 500 million of cash us foods net debt to be assumed or refinanced was approximately 48 billion as of june 28 2014 bringing the total enterprise value to 85 billion as of august 13 2014 the value of sysco’s common stock and the amount of us foods’ net debt will fluctuate as such the components of the transaction and total enterprise value noted above will not be finalized until the merger is consummated 

  

 

we have secured a fully committed bridge financing and expect to issue longerterm financing prior to closing after completion of the transaction the equity holders of us foods will own approximately 87 million shares or roughly 13 of sysco a representative from each of us foods’ two majority shareholders will join sysco’s board of directors upon closing this merger is currently pending a regulatory review process by the federal trade commission we expect the transaction to close by the end of the third quarter or in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 under certain conditions including lack of regulatory approval sysco would be obligated to pay 300 million to the owners of us foods if the merger were cancelled which would be recognized as an expense 

  

business transformation project 

  

our multiyear business transformation project consists of 

  







  

with respect to our erp system we successfully installed a major scheduled update to the system and have deployed the system to twelve locations as of the end of july 2014 in fiscal 2015 we will implement a software version upgrade finalize information technologyrelated us foods merger integration planning and sequencing decisions and enhance the scalability of our shared service center’s processes to prepare for more conversions in the future our goal with integration planning is to sequence the decisions of our erp implementation to help us achieve the most synergies in a timely manner 

  

we are seeking to lower our operating cost structure through various initiatives these include routing optimization to reduce routes and miles driven while improving ontime deliveries this initiative is expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2015 we made substantial progress on our fleet and equipment optimization initiative aimed at reducing costs and optimizing our capital spend we expect to complete the rationalization of our fleet by the end of fiscal 2015 driver and warehouse pay structures are being enhanced including tools to more effectively manage labor costs we are also piloting a program to increase the amount of recycled material in our operations we expect to roll out this program across the country by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2015 which should also reduce costs 

  

we also seek to lower our product costs through various initiatives such as our category management initiative this initiative is designed to lower our total product costs and to align our product assortment with customer demand we are using market data and customer insights to make changes to our product assortment while building strategic partnerships with our suppliers to grow our sales and our suppliers’ sales we believe there are opportunities to more effectively provide the products that our customers want commit to greater volumes with our suppliers and create mutual benefits for all parties we believe that procuring greater quantities with select vendors will result in reduced prices for our product purchases in fiscal 2014 we launched several product categories developed and implemented fieldready sales tools and enhanced customer support and improved communication and coordination with the field by the end of fiscal year 2015 we expect to have launched all of the categories in the scope of this initiative we continue to believe this initiative will provide benefits to our customers and savings for us over the next few years 

  

the following tables outline our business transformation project expenditures that are attributable to our erp system implementation and shared service support center for the periods presented 

  



  

  



  

 

the decrease in expenses in fiscal 2014 was due to lower employee costs that were attributed to our business transformation project due to a change in allocation for employees that are not dedicated full time to the project only full time employee costs are included in fiscal 2014 while fiscal 2013 included all employee costs additional contributors to the decrease in fiscal 2014 include an increased level of capitalization on amounts spent for system improvements and reduced level of spend with consultants in fiscal 2014 the increase in expenses in 2013 was largely attributable to deployment costs and software amortization which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and totaled 768 million our cash outlay for our business transformation project which excludes noncash expenses such as software amortization has decreased in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 primarily due to lower levels of spend on internal labor and consultants 

  

our goal for our business transformation project is to generate approximately 550 million to 650 million in annual benefits to be achieved by fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2014 we exceeded our benefit goals and believe we will exceed our goals again in fiscal 2015 

  

  

results of operations

the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 



  

1 other expense income net was income of 122 million in fiscal 2014 175 million in fiscal 2013 and 68 million in fiscal 2012 

  

sales 

  

sales for fiscal 2014 were 47 higher than fiscal 2013 sales for fiscal 2014 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices case volume growth and sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months our sales growth in fiscal 2014 was greater with our corporatemanaged customers as compared to sales growth with our locallymanaged customers we believe our locallymanaged customer growth has been negatively influenced by market conditions including lower 

 

consumer spend the disparity in the growth rate between these customer types moderated in the last half of fiscal 2014 with locallymanaged sales growth trending at similar rates as corporatemanaged customers changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 21 during fiscal 2014 driven mainly by inflation in the meat seafood and dairy categories case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 34 in fiscal 2014 case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 22 in fiscal 2014 our case volumes represent our results from our broadline and sygma segments combined sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 14 in fiscal 2014 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 07 in fiscal 2014 

sales for fiscal 2013 were 48 higher than fiscal 2012 sales for fiscal 2013 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and case volume growth our sales growth in fiscal 2013 was greater with our corporatemanaged customers as compared to sales growth with our locallymanaged customers we believe our locallymanaged customer sales growth was negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 13 in fiscal 2013 our case volumes represent our results from our broadline and sygma segments only sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 15 for fiscal 2013 case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 26 in fiscal 2013 changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 22 during fiscal 2013 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal 2012 

  

operating income 

  

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 

  

fiscal 2014 vs fiscal 2013 

  

the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

  



  

the decrease in operating income was impacted by an increase in 551 million in operating expenses attributable to certain items operating income and adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 were lower than fiscal 2013 primarily from a lower rate of growth in our gross profit increased expenses from higher case volumes some of which is attributable to our acquired operations increased depreciation and amortization increased delivery costs and higher corporate expenses these were partially offset by lower business transformation project expenses and benefits from business transformation project initiatives as a percentage of sales we experienced favorable expense management due in part to benefits from our business transformation project initiatives 

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased sales volumes the first half of fiscal 2014 contained weaker gross profit growth of 12 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2013 inflation and locallymanaged customers case growth was lower in the first half of fiscal 2014 inflation increased as did localmanaged customers case growth in the second half of fiscal 2014 gross profits grew at a greater rate of 34 in the second half of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same time period in fiscal 2013 as result of these factors and in part from our business transformation project initiatives gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of sales was 1759 in fiscal 2014 a decline of 42 basis points from the gross margin of 1801 in fiscal 2013 this decline in gross margin was partially the result of weak restaurant traffic and increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market increased sales to lower margin corporatemanaged customers also contributed to the decline in fiscal 2014 these customers purchase higher volumes and therefore margins tend to be lower with this customer group than our locallymanaged customers our locallymanaged customers comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes and an even greater percentage of profitability because of the high level of value added services we typically provide to this customer group the disparity in the growth rate between these customer types moderated in the last half of fiscal 2014 with locallymanaged sales growth 

 

trending at similar rates as corporatemanaged customers if sales from our locallymanaged customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from these corporatemanaged customers our gross margins may continue to decline our inflation rates were relatively stable over the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 however it increased in the fourth quarter all quarters being compared to the past year fourth quarter fiscal 2014 inflation was seen primarily in the meat seafood and dairy categories which represent more than onethird of our annual sales while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers and inflation can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit operating income and earnings 

  

operating expenses for fiscal 2014 increased 40 or 2558 million over fiscal 2013 adjusted operating expenses for fiscal 2014 increased 32 or 2007 million over fiscal 2013 these increases were primarily due to increased expenses from higher case volumes some of which is attributable to our acquired operations increased depreciation and amortization increased delivery costs and higher corporate expenses these were partially offset by lower business transformation project expenses and benefits from business transformation project initiatives we believe favorable expense management partially from our business transformation project initiatives helped to keep our operating expense increases from being greater sysco’s operating expenses are impacted by certain charges and adjustments which we refer to as certain items and which resulted in an increase in operating expenses of 551 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 more information on the rationale of the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

operating expenses impacting adjusted operating income 

  

our operating expenses increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 partially due to expenses from our acquired operations expenses attributable to volume growth and increased delivery costs payrelated expenses represent a significant portion of our operating costs contributed to the increase in each of these three categories of expenses and contributed to cost increases in our corporate expenses payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project us foods integration planning and retirementrelated expenses increased by 744 million in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the increase was primarily due to costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months as well as increased delivery and warehouse compensation partially attributable to case growth payrelated costs have also increased at our corporate office as certain employee costs attributed to our business transformation project in fiscal 2013 are no longer attributed to the business transformation project in fiscal 2014 due to a change in allocation methodology in fiscal 2013 we allocated internal associates based upon estimates of the percentage of time they spent on the project in fiscal 2014 only associates that that are dedicated full time to the project are included in business transformation project costs these increases were partially offset by reduced sales compensation information technology compensation and lower provisions for management incentive plans benefits from our business transformation project initiatives have helped in lowering the rate of growth in these expenses particularly in our sales area for fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2013 we streamlined our sales management organization and modified marketing associate compensation plans fiscal 2014 was also impacted by a reduction in pay in the information technology area resulting from the restructuring of this department in fiscal 2013 which reduced headcount in this area 

  

depreciation and amortization expense excluding the increase related to our business transformation project described below increased by 328 million in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 the increase was primarily related to depreciation on assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2013 that were in service in fiscal 2014 

  

our retirementrelated expenses consist primarily of costs from our retirement plan serp and our defined contribution plans as a part of our business transformation project initiatives our retirement plan was substantially frozen and the serp was completely frozen in fiscal 2013 and our defined contribution plans were enhanced with greater benefits the net impact in fiscal 2014 of our retirementrelated expenses as compared to fiscal 2013 was a decrease of 868 million consisting of a 1336 million decrease in our net companysponsored pension costs and approximately 62 million for other costs partially offset by 530 million increased costs from our defined contribution plans the benefits in the retirementrelated expense have largely been realized and the amount of cost decrease is not expected to recur at the same magnitude in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 

  

in addition to the increases in our corporate office expenses from payrelated expenses noted above other sources of cost increases in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 were due to increasing the capabilities of various departments within our corporate office a subset of our business technology costs has been attributable to our business transformation project expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated and software amortization expense were 2770 million in fiscal 2014 and 3305 million in fiscal 2013 representing a decrease of 535 million the decrease in fiscal 2014 resulted from a reduction in certain employee costs that were attributed to our business transformation project in fiscal 2013 that are no longer attributed to the business transformation project in fiscal 2014 due to a change in allocation methodology in fiscal 2013 we allocated internal associates based upon estimates of the percentage of time they spent on the project in fiscal 2014 only associates that that are dedicated full time to the project are included in business transformation project costs additional contributors to the decreases include an increased level of capitalization on amounts spent for system improvements to enhance stability and scalability and reduced level of spend with consultants as compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2013 the decrease in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the business transformation project of 107 million in fiscal 2014 

 

over fiscal 2013 we expect our corporate office expenses to continue to rise in fiscal 2015 as we expand our corporate capabilities including a new revenue management function organizational changes that drive greater functional support in our broadline operations and additional investments in technology 

  

cost per case is an important metric management uses to measure our expense performance this metric is calculated by taking the total operating expense of our north american broadline companies divided by the number of cases sold adjusted cost per case is calculated similarly however the operating expense component excludes charges from executive retirement plans restructuring multiemployer pension plans and severance which are the certain items applicable to these companies divided by the number of cases sold our corporate expenses are not included in the cost per cases metrics because the metric is a measure of efficiency in our operations we seek to grow our sales and either minimize or reduce our costs on a per case basis our cost per case was a decrease of 010 per case in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 our adjusted cost per case calculated on a nongaap basis decreased 006 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas and lower retirementrelated expenses partially offset by increased costs from delivery payrelated expenses we expect our cost per case in fiscal 2015 to be similar to fiscal 2014 more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

certain items within operating expenses 

  

sysco’s results of operating expenses are impacted by certain items which are expenses that can be difficult to predict and can be unanticipated more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” our significant certain items applicable for fiscal 2014 included costs in connection with the proposed merger with us foods a change in the estimate of our self insurance reserve and a liability for a settlement our significant certain items applicable for fiscal 2013 related to withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer pension plans severance charges and costs from restructuring executive retirement plans costs from restructuring executive retirement plans are discussed below under fiscal 2013 vs fiscal 2012 

  

we have incurred additional costs in connection with the proposed merger with us foods announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 primarily from integration planning and due diligence costs these costs totaled 906 million in fiscal 2014 we anticipate incurring additional costs as we continue planning for integration of the two companies as well as other financing costs incurred in connection with the proposed merger 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we recorded provisions of 15 million and 419 million respectively related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 

  

sysco maintains a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general and vehicle liability and property insurance costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 based on the historical trends of increased costs primarily attributable to our worker’s compensation claims we increased our estimates of our selfinsurance reserve to a higher point in an estimated range of liability as opposed to our past position at the lower end of the range this resulted in a charge of 238 million in fiscal 2014 

  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 sysco was made aware of certain alleged violations of california law relating to its use of remote storage units in the delivery of products these are commonly referred to as drop sites as of june 28 2014 we have recorded a liability for a settlement of 20 million in july 2014 sysco agreed to a 194 million settlement which includes a payment of 150 million in penalties 33 million to fund four california department of public health investigator positions for five years a 10 million donation to food banks across california and 01 million in legal fees the cash portion of the settlement was paid in august 2014 and the donations to the food banks will occur in fiscal 2015 in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we eliminated the use of drop sites across sysco during fiscal 2014 we introduced mandatory annual food safety training for all employees across sysco we are implementing additional and improved food safety reporting monitoring and compliance controls across our operations to ensure adherence to our policies 

  

 

fiscal 2013 vs fiscal 2012   

  

the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

  



  

the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by increased expenses including charges related to our business transformation project and increased payrelated expenses the decrease in adjusted operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by increased expenses including increased payrelated expenses 

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased sales gross margin was 1801 in fiscal 2013 a decline of 35 basis points from the gross margin of 1836 in fiscal 2012 this decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from corporatemanaged customers gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than other types of customers increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins 

  

we estimate that sysco’s product cost inflation was 22 during fiscal 2013 based on our product sales mix for fiscal 2013 we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories 

  

operating expenses for fiscal 2013 increased 76 or 4495 million over fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased expenses from our business transformation project payrelated expenses charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals depreciation and amortization expense and fuel adjusted operating expenses increased 45 or 2537 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to increased payrelated expenses depreciation and amortization expense and fuel 

  

operating expenses impacting adjusted operating income 

  

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project and retirementrelated expenses increased by 483 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily due to added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months and increased delivery and warehouse compensation delivery and warehouse compensation includes activitybased pay which increases when our case volumes increase additionally pay rates were higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs due to labor shortages these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology payrelated expenses as a result of some of our business transformation project initiatives during fiscal 2013 we streamlined our sales management organization and modified marketing associate compensation plans we also restructured our information technology department during the midpoint of fiscal 2013 reducing headcount as a result 

  

our retirementrelated expenses consist primarily of costs from our retirement plan serp and our defined contribution plan the net impact in fiscal 2013 of our recurring retirementrelated expenses excluding charges noted below related to the executive retirement plans restructuring was an increase of 103 million as compared to fiscal 2012 this net increase consisted of 460 million increased recurring costs from the defined contribution plan a 331 million decrease in our recurring net companysponsored pension costs and a decrease of approximately 26 million for other costs at the end of fiscal 2012 sysco decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan absent the retirement plan freeze net companysponsored pension costs would have increased 1069 million in fiscal 2013 during fiscal 2013 we approved a plan to restructure our executive nonqualified retirement program including the serp and our executive deferred compensation plan a nonqualified defined contribution plan became effective on january 1 2013 as a replacement plan and benefits were frozen under the serp at the end of fiscal 2013 we believe this restructuring more closely aligned our executive plans with our nonexecutive plans additional nonrecurring costs related to the restructuring are discussed below under “certain items within operating expenses” 

 

  

depreciation and amortization expense excluding the increase related to our business transformation project described below increased by 360 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily related to assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013 primarily from new facilities property from new acquisitions and expansions 

  

fuel costs increased by 189 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices and increased gallon usage our costs per gallon increased 28 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 our activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices 

  

our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods in fiscal 2013 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 178 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2012 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 202 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 

  

our cost per case was an increase of 003 per case in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 our adjusted cost per case calculated on a nongaap basis decreased by 001 per case as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse payrelated expenses increased retirementrelated expenses and fuel increases 

  

certain items within operating expenses 

  

our results of operating expenses are impacted by certain items which are expenses that can be nonrecurring or not a part of our everyday operations see more information on the rationale of the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated and software amortization expense were 3305 million in fiscal 2013 and 1931 million in fiscal 2012 representing an increase of 1374 million the increase in fiscal 2013 resulted in part from the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in august 2012 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the business transformation project was 596 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 our project was not in the deployment stage during any period of fiscal 2012 therefore a greater portion of the costs were capitalized in fiscal 2012 

  

as a result of executive retirement plan restructuring discussed above we incurred 210 million in charges in fiscal 2013 these charges are in addition to the recurring retirementrelated expenses discussed above 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we recorded provisions of 419 million and 219 million respectively related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings decreased 61 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 due primarily to the changes in operating income discussed above adjusted net earnings decreased 18 during fiscal 2014 

  

net earnings for fiscal 2013 decreased 115 over fiscal 2012 this decrease was primarily due to changes in operating income discussed above adjusted net earnings increased 01 during fiscal 2013 

  

the effective tax rate of 3687 for fiscal 2014 was negatively impacted primarily by two items first we recorded tax expense of 62 million related to a nondeductible penalty that the company incurred second we recorded net tax expense of 52 million for tax and interest related to various federal foreign and state uncertain tax positions this negative impact was partially offset by the recording of 57 million of tax benefit related to disqualifying dispositions of sysco stock pursuant to sharebased compensation arrangements indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

  

the effective tax rate of 3587 for fiscal 2013 was favorably impacted primarily by two items first we recorded a tax benefit of 140 million related to changes in estimates for the prior year domestic tax provision second we recorded a tax benefit of 88 million related to disqualifying dispositions of sysco stock pursuant to sharebased compensation arrangements the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recording of 57 million in tax and interest related to various federal foreign and state uncertain tax 

 

positions indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 3713 indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory tax rates less than our domestic tax rate had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

  

earnings per share 

  

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was 159 a 54 decrease from the fiscal 2013 amount of 168 per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was 158 a 54 decrease from the fiscal 2013 amount of 167 per share this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was 176 a decrease of 11 from the comparable prior year period amount of 178 

  

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was 168 a 120 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 191 per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was 167 a 121 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 190 per share this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was 214 a decrease of 05 from the comparable prior year period amount of 215 

  

all earnings per share metrics for fiscal 2013 were partially impacted from greater shares outstanding sysco experienced a greater number of stock option exercises in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 which increased the number of shares outstanding 

  

nongaap reconciliations and adjusted cost per case 

  

sysco’s results of operations are impacted by costs from executive retirement plans restructuring charges multiemployer pension mepp charges severance charges merger and integration costs associated with our pending us foods merger a fiscal 2013 acquisition related charge change in estimate for selfinsurance costs charges from a liability for a settlement facility closure charges and amortization of us foods financing costs management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income interest expense net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove the impact of these items provides an important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a yearoveryear basis 

  

additionally the comparison of sysco’s results of operations of fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 was impacted by costs from the business transformation project btp costs as the level of costs in each year was significantly different as such operating expenses operating income interest expense net earnings and diluted earnings per share are adjusted below to facilitate comparison on a yearoveryear basis of fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2014 btp costs were not considered certain items as the costs of this project became a part of our general corporate expense as a result our fiscal 2013 period excludes btp costs when comparing to fiscal 2014 however it includes btp costs when comparing to fiscal 2012 

  

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the tables below where applicable each period presented is adjusted to remove the costs described above in the tables below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of actual operating expenses operating income interest expense net earnings and diluted earnings per share to adjusted results for these measures for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 



  

 

  

1   the net earnings and diluted earnings per share impacts are shown net of tax except as noted below the aggregate tax impact of adjustments for executive retirement plans restructuring charges mepp charges severance charges merger and integration costs associated with our pending us foods merger a fiscal 2013 acquisition related charge change in estimate for selfinsurance costs charges from a liability for a settlement facility closure charges and amortization of us foods financing costs was 672 million and 378 million for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 respectively amounts are calculated by multiplying the operating income impact of each item by the respective year’s effective tax rate with the exception of the charges from the settlement liability which has an estimated nondeductible portion and the fiscal 2013 acquisitionrelated charge which has no tax impact

1 the net earnings and diluted earnings per share impacts are shown net of tax except as noted below the aggregate tax impact of adjustments for business transformation project mepp charge severance charges executive retirement plans restructuring and facility closure charges was 1503 million and 852 million for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively the fiscal 2013 acquisitionrelated charge had no tax impact 

  

  

 

cost per case is an important metric management uses to measure our expense performance this metric is calculated by taking the total operating expense of our north american broadline companies divided by the number of cases sold adjusted cost per case is calculated similarly however the operating expense component excludes charges from executive retirement plans restructuring multiemployer pension plans and severance which are the certain items applicable to these companies divided by the number of cases sold our corporate expenses are not included in the cost per cases metrics because the metric is a measure of efficiency in our operations we seek to grow our sales and either minimize or reduce our costs on a per case basis our north american broadline companies represent approximately 80 of our of total sales and 80 of our total operating expenses prior to corporate expenses sysco considers adjusted cost per case to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors about syscos expense management an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap in the table that follows the change in adjusted cost per case is reconciled to cost per case for the periods presented 

  

  



  



  

  

  

segment results 

  

we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k  intersegment sales represent specialty produce and imported specialty products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies  

  

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results  corporate expenses and adjustments generally include all expenses of the corporate office and sysco’s shared service center these also include all sharebased compensation costs and expenses related to the company’s business transformation project while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short  term by increases or decreases in gross profits expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

  

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with note 21  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

 

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with note 21  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

1 sygma had operating income of  380 million in fiscal 2014   520 million in fiscal 2013 and  610 million in fiscal 2012  

  

the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment and intersegment sales expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales including intersegment sales and operating income respectively for purposes of this statistical table operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses and adjustments of  10203 million in fiscal 2014   8943 million in fiscal 2013 and  6776 million in fiscal 2012 that are not charged to our segments this information should be read in conjunction with not e 21  “ business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

broadline segment 

  

the broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s us  canadian    caribbean and european broadline segments broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers  hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served these companies also provide customcut meat operations  broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2014  the broadline operating results represented approximately 810  of sysco’s overall sales and 949  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses 

  

there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segment’s earnings 

  

sales 

  

sales for fiscal 2014 were 44  higher th an fiscal 2013 sales for fiscal 201 4 increased as a r esult of sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months case volume growth and product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices our sales growth in fiscal 2014 was greater with our corporatemanaged customers as compared to sales growth with our locallymanaged customers we believe our locallymanaged customer growth has been negatively influenced market conditions including lower consumer spend the disparity in the growth rate between these customer types moderated in the last half of fiscal 2014 with locallymanaged sales growth trending at similar rates as corporatemanaged customers sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 17  in fiscal 2014 changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 20 during fiscal 2014 driven mainly by inflation in the meat seafood and dairy categories the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 08  in fiscal 2014 

  

sales were 50 greater in fiscal 2013 than fiscal 2012 sales for fiscal 2013 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and improving case volumes our sales growth in fiscal 2013 has been greater with our corporatemanaged customers   as compared to sales growth with our locallymanaged customers we believe our locallymanaged customer sales growth has been negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months contributed 16 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2013 changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 23 in fiscal 2013 the 

 

changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact   on sales when compared to fiscal 201 2  

  

operating income 

  

fiscal 2014 vs fiscal 2013 

  

operating income increased by 31 in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 fiscal 2014 included 15 million in charges related to withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans as compared to 419 million in charges in fiscal 2013 we also experienced growth in our gross profits increased expenses from higher case volumes some of which is attributable to our acquired operations increased depreciation and amortization and increased delivery costs these were partially offset by benefits from business transformation project initiatives included lower sales organization costs and retirementrelated expenses as a percentage of sales we experienced favorable expense management partially from benefits from our b usiness t ransformation project initiatives 

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2014 primarily due to increased sales however gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales gross profits grew at a greater rate in the second half of fiscal 2014 as compared to the same time period in fiscal 2013 as result of increased inflation higher locallymanaged customer case growth and in part from our business transformation project initiatives this decline in gross margin was partially the result of weak restaurant traffic and increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market increased sales to lower margin corporatemanaged customers also contributed to the decline in fiscal 2014 these customers purchase higher volumes and therefore margins tend to be lower with this customer group than our locallymanaged customers our locallymanaged customers comprise a significant portion of our overall volumes and an even greater percentage of profitability because of the high level of value added services we typically provide to this customer group the disparity in the growth rate between these customer types moderated in the last half of fiscal 2014 with locallymanaged sales growth trending at similar rates as corporatemanaged customers if sales from our locallymanaged customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from these corporatemanaged customers our gross margins may continue to decline our inflation rates were relatively stable over the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 however it increased in the fourth quarter all quarters being compared to the past year fourth quarter fiscal 2014 inflation was seen primarily in the meat seafood and dairy categories which represent more than onethird of our annual sales while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can be difficult to pass on to our customers and inflation can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit operating income and earnings 

operating expenses for the broadline segmen t increased in fisc al 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 fiscal 2014 included 15 million in charges related to withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans as compared to 419 million in charges in fiscal 2013 the increase in expenses for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was driven largely by expenses from acquired operations expenses attributable to volume growth and increased depreciation and amortization expense payrelated expenses increased primarily from added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months as well as increased delivery compensation partially attributable to case growth depreciation and amortization increased primarily from assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2013 that were in service in fiscal 2014 these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology payrelated expenses retirementrelated costs decreased primarily from the plan freezes that occurred in fiscal 2013 our expense on a cost per case basis decreased as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas and lower retirementrelated expenses partially offset by increased costs from delivery payrelated expenses 

  

fiscal 201 3 vs fiscal 201 2 

  

operating income decreased by 06 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 this decrease was driven by operating expenses increasing more than gross profit dollars   

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased sales however gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales this decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from corporatemanaged customers gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than from other types of customers increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins our broadline segment experienced product cost inflation in fiscal 2013 based on our product sales mix during fiscal 2013 we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories 

operating expenses for the broadline segment increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the expense increases in fiscal 2013 were driven largely by charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals payrelated expenses including severance costs depreciation and amortization expense and fuel the increase in payrelated expenses was primarily due to increased delivery and warehouse compensation partially attributable to case growth and added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months delivery and warehouse compensation includes activitybased pay which will increase when our case volumes increase additionally pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology payrelated expenses our enhanced defined contribution plan became 

 

effective january 1 2013 and contributed to the increase in operating expenses depreciation and amortization increased primarily from assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013 primarily from new facilities property from new acquisitions and expansions fuel costs were 167 million higher in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012 

  

in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we recorded provisions of 419 million and 219 million respectively related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 

  

our fiscal 2013 cost per case excluding charges related to withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans decreased as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse payrelated expenses increased retirementrelated expenses and fuel increases 

  

sygma segment 

  

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

  

sales 

  

sales were 69 greater in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013 the increase was primarily due to new customers other contributors to the increase were product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices and case volume increases from existing customers we do not expect sales growth to continue at the same level in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the expectation of fewer new customers in fiscal 2015 as well as competitive pricing pressures 

  

sales were 08 greater in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices partially offset by case volume declines case volumes were challenged from low levels of growth from existing customers and from lost customers 

  

one chain restaurant customer the wendy’s company accounted for approximately 23 of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended june 28 2014 sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

  

operating income 

  

operating income decreased by 269 in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 gross profit dollars increased 28 while operating expenses increased 65 in fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 gross profit dollar growth was lower than sales growth primarily due to reduced fuel surcharges operating expenses increased in fiscal 2014 largely due to increased delivery costs including payrelated expenses also contributing to the increase in expense were startup costs related to new customers and expenses incurred for a facility consolidation operating income is not expected to decrease at the same rate in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 as startup costs for new customers should be at lower amounts than those experienced in fiscal 2014 we continue to focus on increasing profitability while remaining responsive to our customers’ needs 

  

operating income decreased by 147 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 gross profit dollars decreased 09  while operating expenses increased 12 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 these gross profit results largely reflect the sluggish sales environment operating expenses increased in fiscal 2013 largely due to increased delivery costs including payrelated expenses our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and contributed to the increase in payrelated expense  

  

other segment 

  

“other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments a company that distributes specialty imported products a company that distributes to international customers and our sysco ventures platform our suite of technology solutions that help support the business needs of our customers  these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 

  

on an aggregate basis our “other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired some of the operating companies within th is segment in relatively recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry except for our lodging industry supply company  each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in fiscal 2014  in the aggregate the “other” segment 

 

represented approximately 63  of sysco’s overall sales and 36  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and adjustments  

  

operating income decreased 50 or 49 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the decrease in operating income was largely due to startup costs from our sysco ventures operations partially offset by increased earnings from our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments additionally retirementrelated expenses were greater for these companies for fiscal 2014 as our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and some of these operations were not a part of prior benefit plans 

  

operating income increased 83 for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by earnings from our lodging industry products segment our specialty import business that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and our company that distributes to international customers an additional item partially offsetting the increase in operating income was an increase in retirementrelated expense for these companies our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and contributed to increased expense at these companies 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

highlights 

  

comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 

  

















  

sources and uses of cash 

  

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

  













  

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

  

in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we announced an agreement to merge with us foods as of the time the merger agreement was announced in december 2013 sysco agreed to pay approximately 35 billion for the equity of us foods comprised of 3 billion of sysco common stock and 500 million of cash as part of the transaction sysco will also assume or refinance us foods’ net debt which was approximately 47 billion as of september 28 2013 bringing the total enterprise value to 82 billion at the time of the merger announcement as of august 13 2014 the merger consideration is estimated as follows approximately 37 billion for the equity of us foods comprised of 32 billion of sysco common stock valued using the seven day average through august 13 2014 and 500 million of cash us foods net debt to be assumed or refinanced was approximately 48 billion as of june 28 2014 bringing the total enterprise value to 85 billion as of august 13 2014 the value of sysco’s common stock and the amount of us foods’ net debt will fluctuate as such the components of the transaction and total enterprise value noted above will not be finalized until the merger is consummated we have secured a fully committed bridge financing and expect to issue longerterm financing prior to closing after completion of the transaction the equity holders of us foods will own approximately 87 million shares or roughly 

 

13 of sysco this merger is currently pending a regulatory review process by the federal trade commission and we estimate the merger will close by the end of the third quarter or in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 under certain conditions including lack of regulatory approval sysco would be obligated to pay 300 million to the owners of us foods if the merger were cancelled 

  

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations uncertain economic conditions and uneven levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income have lowered our sales growth and impacted our cash flows from operations competitive pressures in a low growth environment have also lowered our gross margins which in turn can cause our cash flows from operations to decrease we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as credit monitoring optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue to prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations as of june 28 2014 we had 4130 million in cash and cash equivalents approximately 32 of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations however we do not currently anticipate the need to relocate this cash 

  

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

  







  

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary we believe our cash flows from operations will improve over the longterm due to benefits from our business transformation project and initiatives to improve our working capital management and cash flows from the operations of us foods once acquired 

  

cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

fiscal 2014 vs fiscal 2013 

  

we generated 149 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2014 as compared to 151 billion in fiscal 2013 this decrease of 188 million or 12 was largely attributable to a negative comparison on pension expense and contributions reduced net earnings a negative comparison on multiemployer pension withdrawal provisions and payments and an unfavorable comparison on prepaid expenses partially offsetting these unfavorable comparisons was a favorable comparison on working capital several significant accruals in fiscal 2014 and an increase in noncash depreciation and amortization 

  

included in the change in other longterm liabilities was a negative comparison on pension expense and contributions which contributed 650 million to the unfavorable comparison on cash flow from operations for fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 pension expense was 48 million and pension contributions were 248 million in fiscal 2014 which resulted in a decrease to other longterm liabilities pension expense was 1383 million and pension contributions were 936 million in fiscal 2013 which resulted in an increase to other longterm liabilities 

included in the change in accrued expenses was a negative comparison of 494 million on multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments fiscal 2014 included a provision for multiemployer pension withdrawal of 15 million and payments of 408 million which resulted in a decrease to accrued expenses fiscal 2013 included a provision for multiemployer pension withdrawal of 419 million and payments of 318 million which resulted in an increase to accrued expenses partially offsetting the unfavorable impact of the multiemployer accrual comparison were several significant accruals unique to fiscal 2014 which contributed 485 million to cash flow from operations for fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 

  

changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable had a favorable comparison of 1297 million on the comparison of cash flow from operations for fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 there was a favorable comparison on accounts payable which was partially offset by unfavorable comparisons on accounts receivable and inventory accounts receivable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales our sales growth in fiscal 2014 has been greater with our corporatemanaged customers and payment terms for these types of customers are traditionally longer than average this mix of longerterm receivables contributed to the unfavorable comparison on cash flow from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 inventory increased in both 

 

periods as a result of increases in sales however inventory turnover improved in fiscal 2014 as compared to a deterioration of inventory turnover in fiscal 2013 due to working capital improvements in inventory fiscal 2014 also included an increase in inventory in transit which offset the favorable comparison due to working capital improvements resulting in an overall unfavorable comparison on cash flow from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2013 accounts payable increased in both periods as a result of increases in sales the yearoveryear impact of the change in accounts payable is favorable to cash flow from operations due to working capital improvements in accounts payable as well as an increase in fiscal 2014 in accounts payable related to inventory in transit 

  

fiscal 2013 vs fiscal 2012 

  

we generated 15 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to 14 billion in fiscal 2012 the increase of 1074 million or 76 was largely attributable to a favorable comparison yearoveryear on the settlement payments made to the internal revenue service irs an increase in noncash depreciation and amortization expense and a favorable comparison for multiemployer and companysponsored pension expense and contributions these decreases were partially offset by a reduction in net earnings the redemption of some of our corporateowned life insurance coli policies in fiscal 2012 and a reduction in taxes changes in working capital including accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable did not have a significant impact on the comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 these items are more fully described below 

  

in fiscal 2012 we paid 212 million in settlement payments to the irs we completed these settlement payments in fiscal 2012 which resulted in a favorable comparison in cash flow from operations related to this item in fiscal 2013 excluding the irs settlement payment comparison the combined impact of changes in deferred taxes and changes in accrued income taxes was a decrease of 1715 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 this decrease resulted primarily from decreased tax expense of 1074 million year over year and an increase in nonirs tax payments of 596 million which were primarily foreign tax payments related to a onetime transaction as well as increased earnings in these jurisdictions 

  

the increase in noncash depreciation and amortization expense of 956 million was primarily related to assets that were not in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013 these assets include our software related to our business transformation project which was placed into service in august 2012 as well as various new facilities and expansions 

  

multiemployer and companysponsored pension expense and contributions resulted in a favorable comparison of 699 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 provisions for multiemployer pension withdrawals increased 200 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and payments for withdrawals decreased 18 million companysponsored pension contributions decreased 689 million year over year which was partially offset by a decrease in companysponsored pension expense of 208 million 

  

the comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change of 564 million in other assets this unfavorable change resulted primarily from an increase in cash in the prior year from the redemption of approximately 75 million of our coli policies these coli policies were maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the serp and were replaced by less volatile corporateowned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the marketdriven coli impact on our earnings there was no similar redemption in fiscal 2013 other miscellaneous changes in other assets partially offset this decrease year over year 

  

investing activities 

  

  

fiscal 2014 capital expenditures included 

  









  

fiscal 2013 capital expenditures included 

  









  

 

fiscal 2012 capital expenditures included 

  











  

the level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 was mostly consistent with fiscal 2013 representing a small increase of 113 million capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 decreased by 2726 million from fiscal 2012 primarily due to less investment in technology in fiscal 2013 related to our business transformation project due to the initiation of the project’s deployment phase in august 2012 capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 for our business transformation project were 334 million 200 million and 1462 million respectively 

  

we estimate our capital expenditures net of proceeds from sales of assets in fiscal 2015 should be in the range of 500 million to 550 million fiscal 2015 expenditures will include facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions new facility construction including foldout facilities and investments in technology 

  

during fiscal 2014 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 793 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2014 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2014 we acquired for cash operations in meridian idaho landover maryland st louis missouri cleveland ohio and philadelphia pennsylvania 

  

during fiscal 2013 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 3974 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2013 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2013 we acquired for cash foodservice operations in nassau bahamas san francisco california san jose california stockton california ontario canada quebec canada orlando florida dublin ireland st cloud minnesota co down northern ireland greenville ohio and houston texas 

  

during fiscal 2012 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 1106 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2012 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2012 we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in sacramento california quebec canada new haven connecticut grand rapids michigan minneapolis minnesota columbia south carolina and spokane washington in addition sysco acquired for cash a company that distributes specialty imported products headquartered in chicago illinois 

  

free cash flow 

  

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions we do not mean to imply that free cash flow is necessarily available for discretionary expenditures however as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments as a result of decreased cash provided by operating activities and increased capital spending partially offset by increased proceeds from sales of plant and equipment free cash flow for fiscal 2014 decreased 20 or 199 million to 9954 million as compared to fiscal 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities partially offset by increased capital spending resulted in free cash flow for fiscal 2013 increasing 617 or 3874 million to 10 billion as compared to fiscal 2012 

  

 

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap in the tables that follow free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 

  



  

  



  

financing activities 

  

equity transactions 

  

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were 2556 million in fiscal 2014 6287 million in fiscal 2013 and 994 million in fiscal 2012 the level of proceeds in each year is directly related to the number of options exercised in each year the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 

  

we traditionally have engaged in boardapproved share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 10059000 shares for 3324 million in fiscal 2014 21672403 shares for 7216 million in fiscal 2013 and 10000000 shares for 2723 million in fiscal 2012 no additional shares were repurchased through august 13 2014 resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 11655197 shares based on the trades made through that date our share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our average shares outstanding relatively constant over time excluding the impact of the 87 million shares to be issued upon closing of the potential merger with us foods the number of shares we repurchase in fiscal 2015 will be dependent on many factors including the level of future stock option exercises as well as competing uses for available cash 

  

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company’s inception over 40 years ago we target a dividend payout of 40 to 50 of net earnings we paid in excess of that range in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased expenses from our certain items we believe as we realize benefits from our business transformation project our dividend payout will return to this targeted range dividends paid were 6672 million or 114 per share in fiscal 2014 6483 million or 110 per share in fiscal 2013 and 6229 million or 106 per share in fiscal 2012 in may 2014 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 of 029 per share which was paid in july 2014 

  

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 13 2014 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

  

debt activity and borrowing availability 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

we have uncommitted bank lines of credit which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to 950 million of which none was outstanding as of june 28 2014 or august 13 2014 

  

the company’s irish subsidiary pallas foods has a multicurrency revolving credit facility which provides for capital needs for the company’s european subsidiaries in september 2013 this facility was extended and increased to €1000 million euro this facility provides for unsecured borrowings and expires september 24 2014 but is subject to extension outstanding borrowings under this facility were €520 million euro as of june 28 2014 and august 13 2014 

  

 

on june 30 2011 a canadian subsidiary of sysco entered into a shortterm demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the canadian subsidiary to sysco and sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan the amount borrowed was 1820 million and was repaid in full on july 4 2011 

  

commercial paper and revolving credit facility 

  

we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billion 

  

sysco and one of its subsidiaries sysco international ulc have a revolving credit facility supporting the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs the facility provides for borrowings in both us and canadian dollars borrowings by sysco international ulc under the agreement are guaranteed by sysco and borrowings by sysco and sysco international ulc under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the whollyowned subsidiaries of sysco that are guarantors of the company’s senior notes and debentures in january 2014 sysco and sysco international ulc extended and increased the size of the revolving credit facility described above that supports the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs the facility was increased to 15 billion with an expiration date of december 29 2018 but is subject to further extension the other terms and conditions of the extended facility are substantially the same 

  

as of june 28 2014 commercial paper issuances outstanding were 1300 million as of august 13 2014 commercial paper issuances outstanding were 3876 million during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to 7705 million zero to 3300 million and zero to 5631 million respectively during each of fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 016 

  

bridge facility 

  

in december 2013 we secured a commitment for an unsecured bridge facility in the amount of 33865 billion in connection with our proposed merger with us foods discussed further under strategy in january 2014 this bridge facility commitment was replaced with a 33865 billion bridge term loan agreement with multiple lenders we may borrow up to 33865 billion in term loans on the closing date of the us foods acquisition to fund the acquisition refinance certain indebtedness of us foods and pay related fees and expenses the facility expires on march 8 2015 but is subject to extension if regulatory approvals have not yet been obtained borrowings under the bridge term loan agreement are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries of sysco that guarantee the company’s revolving credit facility and in certain circumstances may also be guaranteed by us foods after closing of the merger as an alternative to using our bridge facility we currently intend to issue longerterm financing prior to the closing of the transaction 

  

fixed rate debt 

  

included in current maturities of longterm debt as of june 28 2014 are the 055 senior notes totaling 3000 million which mature in june 2015 it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through cash on hand cash flow from operations issuances of commercial paper senior notes or a combination thereof 

  

in february 2012 we filed with the sec an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities and guarantees of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 

  

in june 2012 we repaid the 61 senior notes totaling 2000 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

  

in may 2012 we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of 2000 million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the then forecasted june 2012 debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate in june 2012 in conjunction with the issuance of the 4500 million senior notes maturing in fiscal 2022 we settled the treasury lock locking in the effective yields on the related debt upon settlement we received cash of 07 million which represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of settlement this amount is being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the 10year term of the debt and the unamortized balance is reflected as a gain net of tax accumulated other comprehensive loss 

  

in june 2012 we issued 055 senior notes totaling 3000 million due june 12 2015 the 2015 notes and 26 senior notes totaling 4500 million due june 12 2022 the 2022 notes under its february 2012 shelf registration the 2015 and 2022 notes which were priced at 99319 and 98722 of par respectively are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions refinancing of debt working capital share repurchases and capital expenditures 

 

  

in february 2013 we repaid the 42 senior notes totaling 2500 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand 

  

in august 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 500 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2018 to floating rate debt this transaction was entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and was designated as a fair value hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

  

in january 2014 we entered into two forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling 20 billion we designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on 10year and 30year debt forecasted to be issued in fiscal 2015 due to changes in the benchmark interest rates 

  

in march 2014 sysco repaid the 46 senior notes totaling 2000 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

  

total debt 

  

total debt as of june 28 2014 was 28 billion of which approximately 74 was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 46 and an average life of 13 years and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 27 and an average life of three years certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders including provisions to maintain the company’s longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants 

  

other 

  

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements in addition in connection with our audits in certain tax jurisdictions we have posted letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process as of june 28 2014 letters of credit outstanding were 457 million 

  

other considerations 

  

multiemployer plans 

  

as discussed in note 15 “multiemployer employee benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

  

under certain circumstances including our voluntary withdrawal or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from certain underfunded plans we would be required to make payments to the plans for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities we believe that one of the abovementioned events is reasonably possible with certain plans in which we participate and estimate our share of withdrawal liability for these plans could have been as much as 900 million as of june 28 2014 and august 13 2014 based on the latest available information available as of each date this estimate excludes plans for which we have recorded withdrawal liabilities or where the likelihood of the abovementioned events is deemed remote due to the lack of current information we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate 

  

as of june 28 2014 and june 29 2013 sysco had approximately 14 million and 407 million respectively in liabilities recorded related to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans for which sysco’s voluntary withdrawal had already occurred 

  

required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition pensionrelated legislation in the us requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 

  

potential contingencies impacting liquidity 

  

certain tax jurisdictions require partial to full payment on audit assessments or the posting of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process sysco has posted approximately 325 million in letters of credit representing a partial payment of the audit assessments in order to appeal the canadian revenue agency assessments of transfer pricing adjustments relating to our cross border procurement activities through our former purchasing cooperative on our 2004 and 2005 fiscal years we are protesting these adjustments through appeals and competent authority if assessed on later years currently under examination using these same positions we could have to pay cash or post additional letters of credit of as much as 1290 million in order to appeal these further assessments 

  

 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table sets forth as of june 28 2014  certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

  



  

  

1 the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement ages and payout periods 

  

2 includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fisc al 202 4  based o n actuarial assumptions 

  

3 unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions as of june 28 2014  we had a liability of  492 million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and  367 million for related interest that could result in cash payment we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of noncurrent payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time accordingly the related noncurrent balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 

  

 4  includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june 28 2014  assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates the impact of our outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june 28 2014  

  

 5  for purposes of this table purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed including minimum quantities resulting from our category management initiative as we progress with this initiative our purchase obligations are increasing     such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates   purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third party service providers to provide information technology services f or period up to fiscal 2019 se e discussion under note 20  “commitments and contingencies” to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8  and fixed fuel purchase commitments   purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 

  

 6  in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 the company announced an agreement to merge with us foods sysco has agreed to pay approximately 37 billion for the equity of us foods comprising 32 billion of sysco common stock valued using the seven day average through august 13 2014 and 500 million of cash as part of the transaction sysco will also assume or refinance us foods net debt which is currently approximately 48 billion as of june 28 2014 bringing the total enterprise value to 85 billion the table above includes the cash payment and the assumption or refinancing of us foods’ net debt the value of sysco’s common stock and the amount of us foods’ net debt will fluctuate as such the components of the transaction and total 

 

enterprise value noted above will not be finalized until the merger is consummated under certain conditions including lack of regulatory approval sysco would be obligated to pay 300 million to the owners of us foods if the merger were cancelled 

  

the retirement plan has no estimated contributions through fiscal 2024 to meet erisa minimum funding requirements based on actuarial assumptions these assumptions include the extension of funding relief included in the highway and transportation funding act of 2014   

  

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved   aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 28 2014   were    706 million    this amount is not included in the table above  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations   these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain   we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure   our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors   we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods   allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries   in addition in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected   our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

  

selfinsurance program 

  

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs   the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers   we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions   projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends   in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

  

companysponsored pension plans 

  

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our retirement plan was frozen in fiscal 2013 and is only open to a small number of employees our serp was frozen in fiscal 2013 due to these plan freezes our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is no longer a critical assumption 

  

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 2014 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 29 2013 measurement date increased 51 basis points to 532 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2014 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 29 2013 measurement date increased 98 basis points to 494 as compared to the discount rate upon the remeasurement of the plan during fiscal 2013 the combined effect of these discount rate changes decreased our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2014 by an estimated 5 million the discount rate for determining fiscal 2015 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 28 2014 measurement date decreased 58 basis p oints to 474 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2015 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 28 2014 measurement d ate decreased   

 

35 basis points to 459 the combined effect of these discount rate changes w ill increase o ur net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2015 by an estimated 7 million a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rates for fiscal 2015 would decrease or increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by approximately 11 million now that sysco’s pension plans are frozen net companysponsored pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to when these plans were active 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan wa s 775 for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013  the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments   although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 76  68  134  and 150 over th e 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2013  respectively   in addition in eight of the last 15 year s  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10    the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

  

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 775 for fiscal 2015    a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2015 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2015 by approximately  29 million 

  

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 28 2014 was a charge net of tax of  6860 million the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 29 2013 was a charge net of tax of  5752 million 

  

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of  248 million and  936 million in fiscal years 2014 and 2013  respectively there was no contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal 2014 as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2013 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements the 700 million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal 2013 was voluntary as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2012 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements  there are no r equired contributions to the retirement plan to meet erisa minimum funding requirements in fiscal 201 5  the estimated fiscal 2015 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately  26   million  

  

income taxes 

  

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws   our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions   jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

  

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected   an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution   a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

  

vendor consideration 

  

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco   there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors   in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound   in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold   in some instances vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold our inventory turnover is usually less than one month therefore amounts deferred against inventory do not require longterm estimation in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized historically adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant    

  

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

  

in addition annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our 12 operating segments as described in note 21  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  the components within each of our 12 operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into 12 reporting units  

  

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models   the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our 12 operating segments   we primarily use a 60  weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and 40  for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant    the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements  when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units   

  

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2013 and 2012 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2014 assessment our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis however we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our caribbean broadline european broadline and sysco ventures reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by 11 to 23 as of june 28 2014 these reporting units had goodwill aggregating 2755 million for the remainder of our reporting units which as of june 28 2014 had goodwill aggregating 17 billion we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 25 

  

certain reporting units caribbean broadline european broadline specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products imported specialty products international distribution operations and our sysco ventures platform have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the us broadline canada broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the us broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the us broadline reporting unit as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans a nonemployee director plan and the employees’ stock purchase plan 

  

as of june 28 2014 there was  649 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 239 years  

  

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model   expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors   we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes   expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant   the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

  

 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 

  

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

  

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees or nonemployee directors is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

  

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period   the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

  

o ur sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period     w e will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

  

in addition certain of our   sharebased   awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement   in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

  

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes   in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options   we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option   in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

  

  

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates  forwardlooking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact forwardlooking statements can also be identified by words such as “future” “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “expects” “intends” “plans” “predicts” “will” “would” “could” “can” “may” and similar terms forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in part i item 1a of this form 10k under the heading “risk factors” which are incorporated herein by reference due to the inherent uncertainties concerning the impact of the pending us foods acquisition it is impracticable for us to provide projections that fully anticipate all possible impacts of the acquisition for that reason forwardlooking disclosures in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form 10k describe anticipated future trends and results of only our current operations excluding any potential impact from the us foods acquisition unless specifically noted completion of the us foods acquisition is likely to materially impact these projections with respect to sysco as a whole we assume no obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statements for any reason except as required by law 

  

in addition to the risk factors discussed in part i item 1a of this form 10k  the success of sysco’s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs our expectations regarding cost per case may be impacted by factors beyond our control including actions by our competitors andor customers companysponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings available cash and the success of our business transformation project our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to our other strategic initiatives the allocation of resources and plans and economic conditions generally legal proceedings and the adequacy of insurance are impacted by events circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include the impact of the us foods acquisition capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated levels of stock repurchases or other unexpected cash requirements plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on management’s assessment of the overall needs of the company capital expenditures may vary from those projected based on 

 

changes in business plans and other factors including risks related to the implementation of our business transformation project and our regional distribution centers the timing and successful completions of acquisitions construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending our ability to finance capital expenditures as anticipated may be influenced by our results of operations the completion of the us foods acquisition our borrowing capacity share repurchases dividend levels and other factors the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect and laws and regulations as well as methods of enforcement are subject to change 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

  

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

  

fiscal 2014 

  

as of june 28 2014  we had 1300 million of commercial paper outstanding total debt as of june 28 2014 was  28 billion of which approximately 74  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement 

  

in august 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 5000 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2018 the fiscal 2018 swap to floating rate debt this transaction was entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions this transaction was designated as a fair value hedges since the swap hedges against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates as of june 28 2014 the fiscal 2018 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 48 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 525 and the floating interest rate on the swap is sixmonth libor which resets every six months in arrears 

  

in january 2014 in contemplation of securing financing and hedging interest rate risk relating to our assumption or refinancing of us foods inc net debt that will occur upon closing of the proposed merger discussed in note 4 “acquisitions” we entered into two forward starting swap agreements with notional amounts totaling of 20 billion we designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on 10year and 30year debt expected to be issued in fiscal 2015 these forward starting swaps were recognized as a liability within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within accrued expenses of 1335 million

in fiscal 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 200 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 the fiscal 2014 swap to floating rate debt this transaction was entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and was designated as a fair value hedge since the swap hedges against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates as of june 29 2013  the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized a s an asset withi n the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of 30 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46  and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us do llars negatively impac ted sales by 07 in fiscal 2014 when compared to fiscal 2013 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales in fisc al 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012  the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share w as not material in fi scal 2014   or fiscal 2013  a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2014 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2014 sales by 11  and woul d not have materially impa cted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share  we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

 

  

fuel price risk 

  

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during each of fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 07 of sales fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges incurred by s ysco increased by   approximately  165 million   in fiscal 2014 from fiscal 2013 and by  189   million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 

  

our activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through our routing optimization project improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 28 2014 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 187 million through june 2015 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 60 to 65 of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel our remaining fuel purchase needs will occur at market rates unless contracted for a fixed price at a later date using current published quarterly market price projections for diesel and estimates of fuel consumption a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price would result in a potential increase of 20 million to 30 million in our fuel costs 

  

investment risk 

  

our companysponsored qualified pension   p lan retirement plan holds investments in public and private equity  fixed income securities and real estate funds the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability  f luctuations in asset values can caus e the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase   and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend  which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments h e ld by our companysponsored retirement plan at the plan’s fiscal year end december 31 2013  wo uld not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2015 however this unfavorable change would increa se our pension expense for fiscal 2015 by  310 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 28 2014 by  1810 million

we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

  







 





  

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

  



  

1 sales are less than 1 of total 

  

our distribution centers which we refer to as operating companies  distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products pac kaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for s ysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

  

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through our approximately   12600 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

  

no single customer accounted for 10 or mo re of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended june 29 2013 

  

based upon available information we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



  

sources of supply 

  

we purchase from thousands of suppliers  both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases  these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

  

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent qual ity food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing su bstantially all product lines sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these   consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating 

 

costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers this includes the construction and operation of regional distribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region currently  we have two rdcs in operation one in virginia and one in florida  

  

working capital practices 

  

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources” at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

  

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

  

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

  

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

  

corporate headquarters and shared services center 

  

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance treasury legal cash management information technology employee benefits engineering real estate and construction risk management and insurance sales and marketing payroll human resources training and development strategy and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

  

our shared services center perform s support services for employees suppliers and customers payroll administration human resources customer and vendor contract administration financial services such as vendor payments invoicing cash application certain credit services accounting and sales and use tax administration procurement and maintenance support and sales support for some of our operating companies 

  

capital improvements 

  

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to modernize expand and construct new distribution facilities during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately  5119 million  7845 million and 6364 million respectively were invested in delivery fleet facilities technology and other capital asset enhancements we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 should be in the range of 550 million to 600 million during the three years ended june 29 2013 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank an d other borrowings we expec t to finance our fiscal 2014 capital expenditures from the same sources 

  

employees 

  

as of june 29 2013 we had approximately 48100 full time employees approximately 17 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters  contract negotiations are handled by eac h individual operating company approximately 35 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which have expired or will expire during fiscal 2014 and are subject to renegotiation since june 29 2013  two contract s covering approximately 300 of such employees have been renegotiated we consider our labor relations to be s atisfactory 

  

competition 

  

industry sources estimate that there are more than 15000 comp anies engaged in the distribution of food and nonfood products to the foodservice industry in the united states our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors a few organizations compete with us on a national basis we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices  an additional competitive factor for our larger chain restaurant customers is the ability to provide a national distribution network we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve a bout 18 of this approximately 23 5 billio n annual market we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the united states and canada foodawayfromhome   industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2013 while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading 

 

distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respectiv e trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our more t han 7000 marke ting associates our diversified product base which includes a differentiated group of high quality sysco brand products the diversity in the types of customers we serve our economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time and provides a national distribution network for larger chain restaurant customers we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements we are the only publiclytraded distributor in the foodawayfromhome industry in the united states while our public company status provides us with some advantages including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

  

government regulation 

  

our company is required to comply and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business in many jurisdictions compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions in general competition laws are designed to protect businesses and consumers from anticompetitive behavior 

  

in the united states as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda the fda regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

  

we and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

  

we are also subject to regulation by numerous federal state and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor which sets employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation which regulates transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

  

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions the fcpa also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized we have implemented and continue to develop a robust anticorruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anticorruption laws in countries where we operate 

  

outside the united states our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations as well as other legal and regulatory requirements 

  

all of our companys facilities and other operations in the united states and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater further most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements we are subject to other federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials however these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

  

 

general 

  

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco ® trademark and our privatelybranded product trademarks that include the sysco ® trademark these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry approximately half of our privatelybranded sales are from products labeled with our sysco ® trademark without any other trademark we believe the loss of the sysco ® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our us trademarks are effective for a ten  year period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration date s unless a particular trademark is no longer in use   the company does not have any material patents or licenses 

  

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

  

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

  

as of june 29 2013 we operated 193 distribution facilities throughout the united states bahamas canada ireland and northern ireland 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified on page 43 and from historical trends 

  

industry and general economic risks 

  

periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

  

volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability in addition periods of rapidly increasing inflation may negatively impact our business due to the timing needed to pass on such increases as well as the impact it may have on discretionary spending by consumers  conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage margin as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

  

our results and financial condition are directly affected by the volatility in the global economic environment local market conditions and low consumer confidence which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

  

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins and is especially susceptible to trends and uncertainty in economic activity such as the general economic slowdown in the us from 2008 to 2011  the global economic environment has recently been characterized by weak economies persistently high unemployment rates inflationary pressures and volatility in financial markets worldwide in addition our results of operations are substantially affected by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market the difficult economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

  









  

 

the uncertainty in the global economic environment has adversely affected both business and consumer confidence and spending and uncertainty about the longterm investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity     

  

competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers and makes it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability 

  

the foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive with numerous regional and local competitors and is a mature industry characterized by slowing revenue growth additionally increased competition from nontraditional sources such as club stores and commercial wholesale outlets with lower cost structures group purchasing organizations or consolidation among competitors have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability new and increased competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting such competition may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

  

although our sales historically have grown faster than the market in recent years we have experienced slowing revenue growth rates these trends have placed pressure on our profit margins and made it more difficult to achieve growth and pass along cost increases we expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our market share sales and profitability through increased expenditures or decreased prices could be adversely impacted 

  

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and forward purchase commitments intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs 

  

the price and supply of fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international political and economic circumstances as well as other factors outside our control such as actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries or opec and other oil and gas producers regional production patterns weather conditions and environm ental concerns on average onhighway diesel fuel prices increased approximately 2 and 14 in fiscal 2013 and 2 012 respectively as compared to the prior year volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past there is no guarantee that we can do so again if another period of high fuel costs occurs if fuel costs increase again in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the thencurrent market price for diesel if fuel prices decrease significantly these forward purchases may prove ineffective and result in our paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel 

  

business and operational risks 

  

our ability to meet our longterm strategic objectives to grow the profitability of our business depends largely on the success of the business transformation project 

  

our multiyear business transformation project consists of 

  









  

although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the longterm the costs exceeded the benefits during the testing stages of implementation of erp including in fiscal 2013 successfully managing deployment is critical to our business success while we expect all of the components of the business transformation project to enhance our value proposition to customers and suppliers and improve our longterm profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established if at all 

  

the actual cost of the erp system may be greater or less than currently expected and continued delays in the execution of deployment may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multiyear timeframe our cost estimates related to our erp system are based on assumptions which are subject to wide variability require a great deal of judgment and are inherently uncertain thus the actual costs of the project in fiscal 2014 and beyond may be greater or less than currently expected we have encountered and we may continue to encounter 

 

the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget including incurring expenses at an earlier or later time than currently anticipated for example we deployed our erp system to three additional locations in fiscal 2013 and are experiencing improved functionality in many areas compared to past deployments however while the majority of the system functionality is performing as designed we have identified areas of improvement to certain components of the system that we want to address before we continue deploying to additional locations 

  

in addition implementation of the systems require significant management attention and resources over an extended period of time and any significant design errors or further delay in the implementation of the systems could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business continued delays in deployment additional operating problems discovered in the underlying information technology systems’ processes cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition because the implementation is expected to continue to involve a significant financial commitment our business results of operations and liquidity may also be adversely affected if the erp system and the associated process changes do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate there can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize the intended results of the system software and implementation activities we expect costs to continue to outweigh benefits for fiscal 2014 as we continue deployment 

  

we may not realize anticipated benefits from our operating cost reduction efforts 

  

we have implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives that we believe are necessary to position our business for future success and growth our future success and earnings growth depend upon our ability to achieve a lower cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity and reduced profitability a variety of factors could cause us not to realize some of the expected cost savings including among other things delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings initiatives lack of sustainability in cost savings over time and unexpected costs associated with operating our business if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease furthermore  even if we realize the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction efforts we may experience an adverse impact on our employees and customers which could negatively affect our sales and profits 

  

we may not realize the full anticipated benefits from our category management initiative 

  

we are in the midst of deploying our category management initiative which encompasses a rigorous process whereby we use market data and customer insights to optimize the product assortment available to our customers strengthen strategic relationships with our suppliers and increase our sales and profit margins if our sales associates are not able to effectively gain acceptance of the new product assortment from our customers or we and our suppliers are not able to absorb the significant administrative and process changes required then we may not be able to successfully execute the category management initiative in the timeline we anticipate and we may not capture the financial and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate or at all furthermore  even if we realize the anticipated benefits of our category management initiative we may experience an adverse impact on our employees and customers which could negatively affect our sales and profits 

  

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs 

  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us however we believe the number of longterm contracts will increase as we progress with our category management initiative although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop conditions water shortages transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs product recalls competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

  

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings 

  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products the sysco brand name trademarks and logos and our reputation are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them anything that damages our reputation or the public’s confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of our 

 

products or relating to activities by our operations employees or agents could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand  and could quickly affect our revenues and profits 

  

reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact the public’s confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically 

  

damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our products and services this reduction in demand together with the dedication of time and expense necessary to defend our reputation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity including dissemination via print broadcast or social media or other forms of internetbased communications adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce shortterm or longterm demand for our products and services even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations any of these events could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

if sales to our independent restaurant customers continue to grow at a lower rate than sales to our large regional and national customers our operating income may decline 

  

similar to industry trends we are currently growing our large regional and national customers sales at a faster rate than our sales to independent restaurant locations gross margin from our large regional and national customers is generally lower than that of our independent restaurant customers because we typically provide a higher level of services to these customers and are able to earn a higher gross margin as a result  if sales to our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same or a greater rate as sales to our large regional and national customers unless we are able to successfully increase prices or reduce our cost structure our operating income   may decline 

  

as we grow sales to large regional and national customers at a faster pace than we grow sales to independent restaurant customers we face the risk that large regional and national customers will increase their proportion of our total sales thus subjecting us to greater risk if we lose one or more of these customers and possibly enabling these larger customers to exert greater pressure on us to reduce our prices 

  

if sales to our large regional and national customers continues to increase at a faster pace of growth than sales to our independent restaurant customers we may become more dependent on large regional and national customers as they begin to represent a greater proportion of our total sales and any loss of sales to these customers could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition additionally as a result of our greater dependence on these customers we could be pressured by them to lower our prices  in that event we would need to achieve additional cost savings to offset these price reductions or our gross margins and profitability would be materially adversely affected  we may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment 

  

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful 

  

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations 

  

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

 

  

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business such as food safety and sanitation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety and due to the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations we have received notice from the state of california and certain county district attorneys alleging violations of statutes related to the use of drop sites which are temporary facilities for holding products prior to distributing them to customers we are fully cooperating with these parties in their investigations we have discontinued the use of drop sites across the enterprise while we believe we have mitigated the risk we may face fines and penalties 

  

if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting seizures or debarments from contracting with the government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

  

product liability claims could materially impact our business 

  

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a healthrelated illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters further even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

  

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively 

  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may be materially adversely impacted integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

  

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on cash flow and liquidity 

  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

  

 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position 

  

as of june 29 2013 we had approximately 3 billion of total indebtedness we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billion a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs in the amount of 10 billion set to expire on december 29 2016 with 925 million extended to december 29 2017 certain uncommitted bank lines of credit providing for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to  950 million and a €750 million euro multicurrency revolving credit facility for use by our irish subsidiary set to expire september 25 2013 which is subject to extension  our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of capital and financial results in the future our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt and any alternative financing measures available may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 

  

we rely on technology in our business and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could have a material negative impact on our business 

  

  our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks to make purchases manage our warehouses and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs and lower profits 

  

furthermore process changes will be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing delivery and payroll systems to support operations as we implement the erp system while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits 

  

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans 

  

  we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 10 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2013 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 66 million which included payments for withdrawal liabilities of 32 million the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit  based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 220 million as of june 29 2013 a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience future declines 

  

at the end of fiscal 2012 we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the companysponsored qualified pension plan  retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 27 billion as of june 29 2013 therefore financial market factors could impact our funding requirements although recent pension funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions that provided the relief are phased out see note 13 “ companysponsored employee benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the retirement plan     

  

the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability our retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in 

 

determining our minimum funding requirements specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse impact on our funding obligations to the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 

  

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages 

  

as of june 29 2013 approximately 8100 employees at 51 operating companies were members of 57 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2014 1 9   agreements covering approximately 2 800   employees have expired or will expire since june 29 2013 two   contract covering approximately 300 of such   employees have been renegotiated failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings 

  

our operations rely heavily on our employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

  

a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers 

  

we use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations we also use mobile devices social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees suppliers business partners and our customers such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks including security breach espionage system disruption theft and inadvertent release of information our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive andor confidential information and intellectual property including customers’ and suppliers personal information private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the company and its business partners further as the company pursues its strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure the company is also expanding and improving its information technologies resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks additionally while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of sensitive andor confidential information or intellectual property or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption negative publicity brand damage violation of privacy laws loss of customers potential liability and competitive disadvantage 

  

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders 

  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

our discussion below of our results includes certain nongaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends any nongaap financial measure will be denoted as an adjusted measure and our fiscal 2013 comparisons to fiscal 2012 exclude the impact from business transformation project costs  multiemployer pension plan charges   severance charges executive retirement plans restructuring a onetime acquisition related charge and facility closure charges  collectively these are referred to as excluded charges our fiscal 2012 comparisons to fiscal 2011 exclude   the impact from business transformation project costs  multiemployer pension plan charges   severance charges corporateowned life insurance coli policies and certain tax benefits  more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under “nongaap reconciliations” 

  

overview 

  

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are primarily located throughout the united states bahamas canada ireland and northern ireland and include broadline companies which include our customcut meat operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary specialty produce companies hotel supply operations a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers 

  

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about 18 of this approximately 235 billion annual market according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 48  of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states   

  

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales increase of approximately 13 in calendar year 2012 and a decline of 01 in calendar year 2011 real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

  

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market historically we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and believe we have continued to grow our market share in this fragmented industry 

  

highlights 

  

fiscal 2013 was a year in which we progressed with our business transformation p roject while facing a challenging business and economic environment the foodservice industry has not fully participated in the overall economic recovery primarily due to constrained consumer spending for foodawayfromhome our results of operations reflect these challenges as well as expenses related to our business transformation project payroll costs charges from the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and increased fuel expense we believe our sales growth and expense management on a cost per cases basis was acceptable however gross profit did not grow as we planned due partially to competitive pressures and a shift in customer mix w e will remain focused on the execution of our business plan and initiatives from our business transformation p roject with the goal for these items to contribute to the longterm success of our customers and in turn growth in our earnings we acquired 14 companies during fiscal 2013 which represents annualized sales in excess of 1 billion we expect these acquisitions will contribute to our sales growth enhance our international market presence and product assortment

trends and strategy 

  

trends 

  

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales consumer confidence has improved since 2008 however it remains below its historical highs we believe that the consumer is currently concerned about lingering unemployment levels and lack of growth in personal income we believe these items and other current general economic conditions have negatively impacted consumer confidence and contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market while these trends can be cyclical in nature greater consumer confidence will be required to reverse the trend according to industry sources real sales growth for the total foodservice market in the united states is expected to be modest over the longterm nontraditional competitors are becoming more of a factor in terms of competition within our industry and consumer spending trends are gradually shifting more to fresh natural and sustainablyproduced products we believe these industry trends reinforce the need for us to transform our business so that we can be in a position to provide greater value to our customers and reduce our overall cost structure 

  

our gross margin performance has been influenced by multiple factors our sales growth in fiscal 2013 was greater with our large regional and national customers gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than our independent restaurant customers if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate or a greater rate than sales from these large regional and national customers our gross margins may decline additional pressure exists on our gross margin from competitive pricing pressures low growth in the foodservice market is contributing to increased competition which is in turn pressuring gross profits we expect this pricing pressure will likely continue inflation can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure however inflation rates remained relatively stable throughout fiscal 2013 at a rate between 20 to 25 inflation was present in certain product categories such as poultry and meat but was not significant in the majority of our product categories while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit operating income and earnings 

  

we have experienced higher operating expenses this fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2012 our business transformation project has been a primary contributor to this increase this project is a key part of our strategy to control costs and grow our market share over the longterm this project includes an integrated software system that went into deployment in august 2012 resulting in increased deployment expenses and software amortization in fiscal 2012 we were still building and testing our software and therefore had a greater amount of capitalized costs we believe expenses related to the project in fiscal 2014 will be similar to the costs incurred in fiscal 2013 operating expenses have also increased due to provisions related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals these pension plan provisions generally occur when a collective bargaining agreement is being renewed payrelated expenses have increased primarily from acquired companies and within delivery areas of our business however these have been partially offset by lower costs in the selling and information technology areas due to initiatives from our business transformation project fuel costs have increased due to both increases diesel prices and gallon usage 

  

our retirementrelated expenses consist primarily of costs from our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan our supplement executive retirement plan serp and our defined contribution plan the net impact in fiscal 2013 of our retirementrelated expenses as compared to fiscal 2012 was an increase of 313 million at the end of fiscal 2012 we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all united statesbased usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan absent the retirement plan freeze discussed above net companysponsored pension costs would have increased 1069 million in fiscal 2013 however because of the freeze the costs decreased as compared to fiscal 2012 our expenses related to our defined contribution plan increased in fiscal 2013 during fiscal 2013 we approved a plan to restructure our executive nonqualified retirement program including the serp by freezing benefits we believe this restructuring more closely aligns our executive plans with our nonexecutive plans as a result of this restructuring we incurred  210 million in charges in fiscal 2013 we expect our retirementrelated expenses will decrease in the range of 75 million to 85 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 a greater portion of the decrease will occur in the second half of fiscal 2014 due to operation of our enhanced defined contribution plan for a oneyear period excluding the 210 million restructuring charge in fiscal 2013 the decrease is expected to be 50 million to 60 million in fiscal 2014 over the longterm we believe the changes to all of these retirement programs will result in reduced volatility of retirementrelated expenses and a reduction in total retirementrelated expenses 

  

we expect gross margin pressure to persist in fiscal 2014 however we intend to achieve sales case growth and to reduce costs per case to improve our earnings performance trends in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 

  

 

strategy 

  

we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the united states canada and ireland while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business daytoday our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service with the aspirational vision of becoming each of our customers’ most valued and trusted business partner we have identified five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision 

  



  



  



  



  



  

business transformation project 

  

our multiyear business transformation project consists of 

  









  

we deployed our erp system to three additional locations in fiscal 2013 and experienced improved functionality in many areas compared to past deployments our shared services center sysco business services continues to expand and provide a broader array of centralized administrative services the majority of the system functionality is performing as designed however we have identified areas for improvement to certain components of the system that we want to address before we continue deploying to additional locations these improvements include simplifying certain processes to improve response times and reduce system loads we believe that this will improve system stability and result in improved ability to scale the system as we move forward while these 

 

improvements are being made we will continue implementing individual modules such as our human resource module and continue with other business transformation initiatives we intend to deploy the system to one additional location around the end of this calendar year if our updates are successful we anticipate that further deployment will resume early in calendar 2014 our deployment schedule will be further defined at that time 

  

our cost transformation initiative seeks to lower our cost structure by 300 million to 350 million annually by fiscal 2015 these include initiatives to increase our productivity in the warehouse and delivery activities including fleet management and maintenance activities it also involves improving sales productivity and reducing general and administrative expenses partially through aligning compensation and benefit plans efforts from our cost transformation initiatives in fiscal 2013 spanned many areas of operations we completed the implementation of maintenance management tools in our united states broadline us broadline companies a customer relationship management tool has been implemented in our us broadline companies that will improve sales productivity we restructured our information technology department and contracted with a third party provider for information technology managed services for our us broadline companies we accelerated the implementation of our human resource module from our erp system which is expected to be complete by the third quarter of fiscal 2014 also in our us broadline companies we began centralizing field finance work to our shared services center we believe this transition will be complete by december 2013 we have begun implementing enhancements to our routing technology and processes to improve delivery efficiencies and expect this initiative to be complete by fiscal 2015 lastly our retirement programs have been restructured which we believe will result in reduced volatility of retirementrelated expenses and a reduction in total retirementrelated expenses in the longterm 

  

our   product cost reduction   and category management initiative is designed to lower our total pro duct costs by 250 million to 300 million annually by fiscal 2015 and to align our product assortment with current customer demand  we are using market data and customer ins ights to make changes to our product assortment while building strategic partnerships with our suppliers we believe there are opportunities to more effectively provide the products that our customers want commit to greater volumes with our suppliers and create mutual benefits for all parties we believe that procuring greater quantities with select vendors will result in reduced prices for our product purchases in fiscal 2013 o ur product cost reduction and category management initiative was active in reducing skus in our inventory and increasing participation in our centralized purchasing initiative we are in the process of piloting four product categories in our category management initiative and have received encouraging acceptance rates from our customers of our new assortment of products our suppliers have engaged in the process and appreciate building strategic partnerships that include customer insights into current trends and product innovations 

  

expenses related to the business transformation project were  330 5 million in fiscal 2013 or 036 per share 1931 million in fiscal 2012 or 021 per share and 1026 million in fiscal 2011 or 011 per share the increase in costs in 2013 was largely attributable to deployment costs and software amortization which began in august 2012 software amortization totaled 768 million in 2013 the increase in costs in 2012 was due to increased project spending  reduced capitalization of expenditures   and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal 2014 will be similar to fiscal 2013 despite the increase in expense our cash outlay   for our business transformation project which excludes noncash software amortization decreased approximately 48 million as compared to fiscal 2012 

  

our goal for our business transformation project is to generate approximately 550 million to 650 million in annual benefits to be achieved by fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2013 we believe we exceeded our goal of realizing approximately 25 of the total benefit in fiscal 2014 we believe we can obtain approximately 50 to 70 of the total targeted benefit if we are successful in obtaining these benefits in fiscal 2014 some of the trends in gross profits and operating expenses noted above could be favorably impacted 

  

our original goal was to grow our diluted earnings per share to 250 to 275 by fiscal 2015 despite the success of our business transformation project our diluted earnings per share has not grown as originally anticipated due to the difficult economic environment and the general operating performance of our underlying business that did not meet our expectations we no longer believe we will achieve our original goal of producing diluted earnings per share to 250 to 275 by fiscal 2015

sales 

  

sales for fiscal 2013 were 48  higher than fiscal 2012 sales for fiscal 2013 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and case volume growth  our sales growth in fiscal 2013 was greater with our large regional and national customers as compared to sales growth with our independent restaurant customers we believe our independent sales growth has been negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved 13  in fiscal 2013 our case volumes represent our results from our broadline and sygma segments only sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 15 for fiscal 2013 our acquisition activity has been greater in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 we estimate the carryover impact into fiscal 2014 will cause sales to increase by approximately 10 we expect to continue the trend of closing acquisitions in fiscal 2014 that will continue to add at least 10 in total annualized sales from new acquisitions in fiscal 2014 changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 22  during fiscal 2013 case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 26  in fiscal 2013 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact   on sales when compared to fiscal 201 2  

  

sales for fiscal 2012 were 78  higher   than fiscal 2011 sales for fiscal 2012   increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices along with improving case volumes  changes in product cost an internal measure of inflation were approximately 55  during fiscal 2012  case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 

 

30 during fiscal 2012 case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 25 during fiscal 2012 sales from acquisitions in the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 07  for fiscal 2012    the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact   on sales when compared to fiscal 201 1  

  

operating income 

  

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities   fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 

  

fiscal 201 3 vs fiscal 201 2 

  

the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

  



  

the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by increased expenses including charges related to our business transformation project and increased payrelated expenses 

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased sales gross margin which is gross profit as a percentage of sales was 177 2 in fiscal 2013 a decline of 3 9 basis points from the gross margin of 1811 in fiscal 2012 this decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from large regional and national customers gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than other types of customers as seen in our results during fiscal 2013 if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate sales from these large regional and national customers our gross margins may decline increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins 

  

we estimate that sysco’s product cost inflation was 22  during fiscal 2013 based on our product sales mix for fiscal 2013 we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories while we cannot predict whether inflation will occur prolonged periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit and earnings 

  

operating expenses for fiscal 2013 increased 73  or  42 32 million  over fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased expenses from our business transformation project payrelated expenses charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals depreciation and amortization expense and fuel ad justed operating expenses increased 41 or 2274 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to increased payrelated expenses depreciation and amortization expense and fuel 

  

expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated and software amortization expense were 3305 million in fiscal 2013 and 1931 million in fiscal 2012 representing an increase of 1374 million the increase in fiscal 2013 resulted in part from the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in august 2012 the increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the business transformation project was 596 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 our project was not in the deployment stage during any period of fiscal 2012 therefore a greater portion of the costs were capitalized in fiscal 2012 we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal 2014 will be similar to fiscal 2013 

  

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project and retirementrelated expenses increased by 483 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily due to added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months and increased delivery and warehouse compensation delivery and warehouse compensation includes activitybased pay which will increase when our case volumes increase additionally pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs due to labor shortages these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information 

 

technology payrelated expenses as a result of some of our business transformation initiatives during fiscal 2013 we streamlined our sales management organization and modified marketing associate compensation plans we also restructured our information technology department during the midpoint of fiscal 2013 reducing headcount as a result 

  

our retirementrelated expenses consist primarily of costs from our retirement plan serp and our defined contribution plan the net impact in fiscal 2013 of our retirementrelated expenses as compared to fiscal 2012 was an increase of 313 million consisting of 48 1 million increased costs from the defined contribution plan a 208 million decrease in our net companysponsored pension costs and approximately 4 million for other costs at the end of fiscal 2012 sysco decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan absent the retirement plan freeze net companysponsored pension costs would have increased 1069 million in fiscal 2013 during fiscal 2013 we approved a plan to restructure our executive nonqualified retirement program including the serp and our executive deferred compensation plan a nonqualified defined contribution plan became effective on january 1 2013 as a replacement plan and benefits were frozen under the serp at the end of fiscal 2013 we believe this restructuring more closely aligned our executive plans with our nonexecutive plans as a result of this restructuring we incurred 210 million in charges in fiscal 2013 we expect our retirementrelated expenses in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 will decrease in the range of 75 million to 85 million primarily from reduced expenses of our retirement plan partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expenses a greater portion of the decrease will occur in the second half of fiscal 2014 due to operation of our enhanced defined contribution plan for a oneyear period excluding the 210 million restructuring charge in fiscal 2013 and the decrease in fiscal 2014 is expected to be 50 million to 60 million over the longterm we believe the changes to all of these retirement programs will result in reduced volatility of retirementrelated expenses and a reduction in total retirementrelated expenses 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased by 956 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase related to our business transformation project is described above the remaining increase of 360 million in fiscal 2013 was primarily related to assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013 primarily from new facilities property from new acquisitions and expansions 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we recorded provisions of 419 million and 219 million respectively related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 

  

fuel costs increased by 189 million in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices and increased gallon usage our costs per gallon increased 28 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 our activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices 

  

our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods in fiscal 2013 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 178 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2012 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 202 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 

  

as of june 29 2013 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 2040 million through august 2014 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 60 to 65 of our fuel purchase needs for the remainder of the fiscal year at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2014 fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 10 to 20 million as compared to fiscal 2013 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2014 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 

  

we also measure our expense performance on a cost per case basis this metric is calculated by taking the total operating expense of our broadline companies excluding charges multiemployer pension plans and severance charges divided by the number of cases sold we seek to grow our sales and either minimize or reduce our costs on a per case basis our fiscal 2013 cost per case decreased by more than 003 per case as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse payrelated expenses increased retirementrelated expenses and fuel increases we expect to continue to reduce our broadline companies cost per case in fiscal 2014 by approximately 005 per case partially from reduced retirementrelated expenses 

  

 

fiscal 2012 vs fiscal 2011 

  

the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

  



  

th e   decrease   in operating income from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by declines in gross margin and increased operating expenses partially from increased expenses from payroll and our business transformation project  these expense increases were partially offset by increases in gross profit dollars  

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 201 2 as compared to fiscal 201 1 primarily due to increased sales  gross margin  which is gross profit as a percentage of sales  was 1811  in fiscal 201 2  a decline of 69 basis points from the gross margin of 1880 in fiscal 201 1  this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation    other factors contributing to our gross margin decline were competitive pressures on pricing segment mix changes where certain of our lower margin segments grew faster than our broadline segment and our own strategy to gain market share  

  

sysco’s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of 55  during fiscal 201 2  based on our product sales mix for fiscal 201 2  we were most impacted by higher levels of infla tion in the   meat canned and dry and frozen product categories in the range of 6  to 8  our product cost inflation reached a high of 73 in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and a low of 33 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable to fully pass through these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business 

  

g ross profit dollars for fiscal 201 2   a lso increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges  fuel surcharges were approximately 475 million higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal 201 2 and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for the entire fiscal period  

  

operating expenses for fiscal 201 2 increased 59 pri marily due to increased payrelated expenses increased expenses related to our business transformation project increased fuel costs and an unfavorable yearoveryear comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values as compared to the prior year period  these increases were partially offset by decreases in net companysponsored pension costs and lower provisions related to multiemployer pension plans  adjusted operating expenses increased 42 or 2217 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 

  

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project increased by 1537 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation and added costs from companies acquired within the last 12 months    sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes and delivery compensation includes activitybased pay which is driven by case volumes  since these drivers   we re variable in nature  increased gross profit dollars and cases volumes increase d sales and delivery compensation  also contributing to the increase in payrelated expenses was an increase in severance incurred in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 of 57 million 

  

expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated expense were 1931 million in fiscal 2012 and 1026 million in fiscal 2011 representing an increase of 905 million the increase in fiscal 2012 resulted from increased project spending  reduced capitalization of expenditures   and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center 

  

f uel costs increased by  398 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices  our costs per gallon increased   130  in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011  our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods in fiscal 201 2  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated  202 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2011 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 164 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 

 

  

we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments which through fiscal 2011 included publicly traded securities as a result the cash surrender values of these policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such securities the changes in the financial markets resulted i n gains for these policies of  282 million in fiscal 2011      near the end of fiscal 2011 we reallocated all of our policies into lowrisk fixedincome securities to reduce earnings volatility and therefore our adjustments for fiscal 2012 were not significant 

  

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2012 wer e 273 million lower than i n fiscal 201 1  the decrease in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to higher returns on assets of sysco’s retirement plan obtained in fiscal 2011 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in the last two fiscal years we voluntary withdrew from several multiemployer plans and recorded provisions of  219 million in fiscal 2012 and  415 million in fiscal 2011  

  

our fiscal 2012 our broadline companies cost per case increased approximately 004 per case as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily from increased payrelated expenses and higher fuel costs 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings decreased 11 5 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 due primarily to the changes in operating income discussed above adjusted net earnings increased 0 1 in fiscal 2013 the increase in adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2013 was primarily from increased gross profits partially offset by increases in adjusted operating expenses that were primarily due to increased payrelated expenses depreciation and amortization expense and fuel 

  

net earnings for fiscal 2012   decreased 2 6  over fiscal 2011  this decrease was primarily due to changes in operating income discussed above  adjusted net earnings increased   46 during fiscal 2012   

  

the effective tax rate of 358 7  for fiscal 2013 was favorably impacted primarily by two items first we recorded a tax benefit of  140 million related to changes in estimates for the prior year domestic tax provision second we recorded a tax benefit of 88 million related to disqualifying dispositions of sysco stock pursuant to sharebased compensation arrangements the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recording of  57 million in tax and interest related to various federal foreign an d state uncertain tax positions indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statut ory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 201 2   was 3713  indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory tax rates less than our domestic tax rate had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

  

the effective tax rate of 3696 for fiscal 2011 was favorably impacted primarily by two items first we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 170 million for the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards second we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values the gain of 282 million recorded in fiscal 2011 was primarily nontaxable for income tax purposes and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by 111 million partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the recording of 93 million in tax and interest related to various federal foreign and state uncertain tax positions 

  

earnings per share 

  

basic earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was  16 8 a 1 20 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 191 per share diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was  16 7  a 1 21 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of 190 per share this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was 214 a decrease of 05 from the comparable prior year period amount of 215 

  

all earnings per share metrics for the fiscal 2013 were partially impacted from greater shares outstanding sysco experienced a greater number of stock option exercises in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 which has increased the number of shares outstanding 

  

basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 were  1 91 and 190 respectively this represents a 26 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for basic earnings per share of 196 per share and a 31 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for diluted earnings per share of 196 this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above adjusted diluted earnings per share was 214 in fiscal 2012 and 205 in fiscal 2011 or an increase of 44  

  

 

nongaap reconciliations 

  

sysco’s results of operations are impacted by co sts from the business transformation project btp costs  multiemployer pension plans mepp severance executive retirement plans restructuring a onetime acquisition related charge and facility closure charges management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove the impact of these items provides an important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental informatio n to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a yearover year basis 

  

additionally near the end of fiscal 2011 we reallocated all of our investments in our coli policies into lowrisk fixedincome securities and therefore we do not expect significant volatility in operating expenses operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share in future periods related to these policies we experienced significant gains in these policies during fiscal 2011 in addition we recorded tax benefits in fiscal 2011 as such the comparison of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 is also adjusted for coli gains and recognized tax benefits 

  

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the tables below where applicable each period presented is adjusted to remove costs of the business transformation project mepp  severance executive retirement plan restructuring a onetime acquisition related charge facility closure charges c oli gains and recognized tax benefits

segment results 

  

we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k  intersegment sales represent specialty produce and imported specialty products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies  

  

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results  corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and sysco’s shared service center these also include all sharebased compensation costs and expenses related to the company’s business transformation project while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short  term by increases or decreases in gross profits expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

  

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with note 21  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with note 21  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

1 sygma had operating income of  520 million in fiscal 2013   610 million in fiscal 2012 and  622 million in fiscal 2011  

  

the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment and intersegment sales expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales including intersegment sales and operating income respectively for purposes of this statistical table operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of  8943 million in fiscal 2013   6776 million in fiscal 2012 and  5588 million in fiscal 2011 that are not charged to our segments this information should be read in conjunction with not e 21 “ business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

 

broadline segment 

  

the broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s united states canadian    caribbean and european broadline segments broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers  hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served these companies also provide customcut meat operations  broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2013  the broadline operating results represented approximately 813  of sysco’s overall sales and 941  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses 

  

there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segment’s earnings 

  

sales 

  

sales were 50 greater in fiscal 2013 than fiscal 2012 sales for fiscal 2013 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and improving case volumes our sales growth in fiscal 2013 has been greater with our large regional and national customers   as compared to sales growth with our independent restaurant customers we believe our independent sales growth has been negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months contributed 16 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2013 our acquisition activity has been greater in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 we estimate the carryover impact into fiscal 2014 will cause sales to increase by approximately 10 we expect to continue at the trend of closing acquisitions in fiscal 2014 that will continue to add annualized sales from new acquisitions in fiscal 2014 changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 23 in fiscal 2013 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact   on sales when compared to fiscal 201 2  

  

sales for fiscal 2012 were 78  greater than fiscal 2011  product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices combined with case volume improvement contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal 2012  changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 57  in fiscal 2012  noncomparable acquisitions contributed 07  to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2012  the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 01 compared to fiscal 2011 

  

operating income 

  

operating income decreased by 06 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 this decrease was driven by operating expenses increasing more than gross profit dollars 

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to increased sales however gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales this decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from large regional and national customers gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than from other types of customers as seen in our results during fiscal 2013 if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from these large regional and national customers our gross margins may decline increased competition resulting from a slowgrowth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins our broadline segment experienced product cost inflation in fiscal 2013 based on our product sales mix during fiscal 2013 we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories while we cannot predict whether inflation will occur prolonged periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit and earnings 

operating expenses for the broadline segment increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the expense increases in fiscal 2013 were driven largely by charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals payrelated expenses including severance costs depreciation and amortization expense and fuel the increase in payrelated expenses was primarily due to increased delivery and warehouse compensation partially attributable to case growth and added costs from companies acquired in the last 12 months delivery and warehouse compensation includes activitybased pay which will increase when our case volumes increase additionally pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology payrelated expenses our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and contributed to the increase in operating expenses depreciation and amortization increased primarily from assets that were not placed in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013 primarily from new facilities property from new acquisitions and expansions fuel costs were 167 million higher in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012 assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2014 fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 5 million to 15 million as compared to fiscal 2013 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements 

 

currently in place for fiscal 2014 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we recorded provisions of 419 million and 219 million respectively related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 

  

our fiscal 2013 cost per case decreased by more than 003 per case as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily from reduced payrelated expenses from our sales and information technology areas partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse payrelated expenses increased retirementrelated expenses and fuel increases we expect to continue to reduce our cost per case in fiscal 2014 by approximately 005 per case partially from reduced retirementrelated expenses 

  

operating income increased by 38  in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 this increase was driven by gross profit dollars increasing more than operating expenses  

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased sales  however gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation and competitive pressures on pricing  based on broadline’s product sales mix for fiscal 2012  we   were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the meat canned and dry and frozen product categories  while we are generally able to p ass through modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business 

  

in addition gross profit dollars for fiscal 2012 increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges  fuel surcharges were approximately  391 million higher in fiscal 2012 than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base during fiscal 2012 due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods  

  

operating expenses for the broadline segment increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the expense increases in fiscal 2012 were driven largely by an increase in payrelated expenses and fuel costs partially offset by a favorable comparison in the provisions recorded for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans in each fiscal year  sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes and delivery compensation includes activitybased pay which is driven by case volumes since these drivers are variable in nature increased gross profit dollars and case volumes will increase sales and delivery compensation  fuel costs were 265 million higher in fiscal 2012 than the prior year 

  

we recorded provisions related to the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans of  219 million in fiscal 2012 and  415 million in fiscal 2011 

  

in fiscal 2012 our broadline companies cost per case increased approximately 004 per case as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily from increased payrelated expenses and higher fuel costs 

  

sygma segment 

  

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

  

sales 

  

sales were 08 greater in fiscal 2013 than in fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices partially offset by case volume declines case volumes were challenged from low levels of growth from existing customers and from lost customers while sygma has experienced some success in replacing lost business with new customers it has not been enough to significantly overcome the factors noted above we believe sygma’s sales growth prospects are better in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 

  

sales were 74  greater in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 the increase in sales was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices    sales to new customers also contributed to the increase  

  

one chain restaurant custome r the wendy’s company acco unted for approximately 25  of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended june 29 2013  sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

 

  

operating income 

  

operating income decreased by 147 in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 gross profit dollars decreased 09  while operating expenses increased 12 in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 these gross profit results largely reflect the sluggish sales environment operating expenses increased in fiscal 2013 largely due to increased delivery costs including payrelated expenses our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and contributed to the increase in payrelated expense 

  

operating income decreased 12 million in 2012 from the prior year due to rising operating expenses gross profit dollars in creased 43 while operating expenses increased 53 in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal 2012 were increased sales and an increase of approximately 83 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2012 from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal 2012   the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2012 was largely driven by increased fuel costs fuel costs in fiscal 2012 were 113 million greater than the prior year assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2013 we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment not to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal 2012 

  

other segment 

  

“other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 

  

on an aggregate basis our “other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry except for our lodging industry supply company  each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in fiscal 2013  in the aggregate the “other” segment represented approximately 62  of sysco’s overall sales and 39  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses 

  

operating income increased 8 3 for fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 the increase in operating income was primarily driven by earnings from our lodging industry products segment our specialty import business that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and our company that distributes to international customers all businesses in this segment experienced increased operating income which was partially offset by charges in our specialty produce companies which incurred facility closing costs of 26 million in fiscal 2013 an additional item partially offsetting the increase in operating income was an increase in retirementrelated expense for these companies our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january 1 2013 and contributed to increased expense at these companies 

  

operating income decreased   92 for fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 the decrease in operating income was caused partially due to increased expenses in our specialty produce segment  

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

highlights 

  

comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 

  



















  

 

sources and uses of cash 

  

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

  













  

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

  

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations uncertain economic conditions and uneven levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income have lowered our sales growth and impacted our cash flows from operations competitive pressures in a low growth environment have also lowered our gross margins which in turn can cause our cash flows from operations to decrease we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as credit monitoring optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations as of june 29 2013 we had  4123 million in cash and cash equivalents approximately 27  of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the united states such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations however we do not currently anticipate the need to relocate this cash 

  

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

  







  

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary we believe our cash flows from operations will improve over the longterm due to benefits from our business transformation project and initiatives to improve our working capital management 

  

cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

fiscal 2013 vs fiscal 2012 

  

we generated  15 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to 14 billion in fiscal 2012 the increase of  1074 million or 76  was largely attributable to a favorable comparison yearoveryear on the settlement payments made to the irs an increase in noncash depreciation and amortization expense and a favorable comparison for multiemployer and companysponsored pension expense and contributions these decreases were partially offset by a reduction in net earnings the redemption of some of our coli policies in fiscal 2012 and a reduction in taxes changes in working capital including accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable did not have a significant impact on the comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 these items are more fully described below 

  

in fiscal 2012 we paid 212 million in settlement payments to the irs we completed these settlement payments in fiscal 2012 which resulted in a favorable comparison in cash flow from operations related to this item in fiscal 2013 excluding the irs settlement payment comparison the combined impact of changes in deferred taxes and changes in accrued income taxes was a decrease of 1715 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 this decrease resulted primarily from 

 

decreased tax expense of 1074 million year over year and an increase in nonirs tax payments of 596 million which were primarily foreign tax payments related to a onetime transaction as well as increased earnings in these jurisdictions 

  

the increase in noncash depreciation and amortization expense of 956 million was primarily related to assets that were not in service in fiscal 2012 that were in service in fiscal 2013 these assets include our software related to our business transformation project which was placed into service in august 2012 as well as various new facilities and expansions we do not anticipate that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase as much in fiscal 2014 

  

multiemployer and companysponsored pension expense and contributions resulted in a favorable comparison of 699 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 provisions for multiemployer pension withdrawals increased 200 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and payments for withdrawals decreased 18 million companysponsored pension contributions decreased 689 million year over year which was partially offset by a decrease in companysponsored pension expense of 208 million we anticipate making a 407 million payment in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2014 related to a fiscal 2013 multiemployer pension withdrawal 

  

the comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change of 564 million in other assets this unfavorable change resulted primarily from an increase in cash in the prior year from the redemption of approximately 75 million of our coli policies these coli policies were maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the serp and were replaced by less volatile corporateowned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the marketdriven coli impact on our earnings there was no similar redemption in fiscal 2013 other miscellaneous changes in other assets partially offset this decrease year over year 

  

fiscal 2012 vs fiscal 2011 

  

we generated  14 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012  as compared to  11 b illion in fiscal 2011  the increase of  3127 million between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was largely attributable to changes in working capital a yearoveryear reduction in tax payments and the redemption of some of our coli policies  these increases were partially offset by the yearoveryear impact of multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments  these items are more fully described below 

  

changes in working capital  specifically accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable contributed  1443 million to the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011    both periods were affected by increases in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable resulting primarily from inflationdriven increases in product costs and sales  however fiscal 2012 was impacted by these items to a lesser extent due primarily to working capital improvements within accounts receivable and inventory and also less growth in average daily sales in the final month of fiscal 2012 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2011  

  

tax payments were 1352 million less in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 the decrease in tax payments was partially due to the company being in a prepaid position at the end of fiscal 2011 in certain jurisdictions in addition various movements in taxable temporary differences caused estimated taxable income to be lower in fiscal 2012 requiring less tax payments in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 we made our final payments on a previous irs tax settlement of 212 million in fiscal 2012 

  

we received approximately 75 million in cash from the onetime redemption during the period of some of our investments in coli policies that we maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the serp this resulted in a positive impact to cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 by decreasing other assets by 571 million those redeemed coli policies were replaced by less volatile existing corporateowned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the marketdriven coli impact on our earnings 

  

multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments had a negative impact of 533 million on the comparison of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012 the net impact of withdrawal provisions and payments was a cash outflow of 117 million in fiscal 2012 compared to a 415 million accrual in fiscal 2012 

  

investing activities 

  

fiscal 2013 capital expenditures included 

  









  

 

fiscal 2012 capital expenditures included 

  











  

fiscal 2011 capital expenditures included 

  











  

capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 decreased by  2726 million from fiscal 2012 primarily due to less investment in technology in fiscal 2013 related to our business transformation project due to the initiation of the project’s deployment phase in august 2012 capital expenditures in fiscal 201 2 increased by 1481 million over fiscal 2011 primarily due to a greater number of new facilities and expansion projects underway in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 for our business transformation project were 200 million 1462 million and 1958 million respectively 

  

we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 to be in the range of 550 million to 600 million    fiscal 2014 expenditures will include facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions new facility construction including foldout facilities and investments in technology 

  

during fiscal 2013  in the aggregate the company paid cash of  3974 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2013 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2013 we acquired for cash foodservice operations in nassau bahamas san francisco california san jose california stockton california ontario canada quebec canada orlando florida dublin ireland st cloud minnesota co  down northern ireland greenville ohio and houston texas 

  

during fiscal 2012  in the aggregate the company paid cash of  1106 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2012 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2012 we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in sacramento california quebec canada new haven connecticut grand rapids michigan minneapolis minnesota columbia south carolina and spokane washington   in addition sysco acquired for cash a company that distributes specialty imported products headquartered in chicago illinois 

  

during fiscal 2011 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 1011 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2011 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2011 we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in central california los angeles california ontario canada lincoln nebraska and trenton new jersey 

  

free cash flow 

  

free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment sysco considers free cash flow to be a nongaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of buildings fleet equipment and technology which may potentially be used to pay for among other things strategic uses of cash including dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions we do not mean to imply that free cash flow is necessarily available for discretionary expenditures however as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments as a result of reduced capital spending and increased cash provided by operating activities free cash flow for fiscal 2013 increased 617 or 3874 million to 10 billion as compared to fiscal 2012 increased cash provided by operating activities partially offset by increased capital spending resulted in free cash flow for fiscal 2012 increasing 324 or 1537 million to 6279 million as compared to fiscal 2011 we expect the growth rate in free cash flow for fiscal 2014 will not be as significant as the growth rate experienced in fiscal 2013 

  

 

free cash flow should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap in the tables that follow free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities

proceeds from exercises of sharebased compensation awards were  6287 million in fiscal 2013   994 million in fiscal 2012 and  3327 million in fiscal 2011 the higher level of proceeds in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in these years as compared to fiscal 2012 the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 

  

we traditionally have engaged in boardapproved share repurchase programs   the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 21672403 shares for  7216 million in fiscal 2013  10 000000 shares for  2723 million in fiscal 2012 and 10000000 shares for  2916 million in fiscal 2011  there were 275000 additional shares repurchased throug h august 14 2013 resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 1214197 shares based on the trades made through that date our share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our average shares outstanding relatively constant over time  due to a high level of stock option exercises in fiscal 2013 more shares were repurchased to meet this strategy the number of shares we repurchase in fiscal 2014 will be dependent on the level of stock option exercises however we believe that share repurchases will be significantly less than the amount repurchased in fiscal 2013 because fewer options are now available for exercise than in fiscal 2013 

  

we have made divide nd payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company inception over 40 years ago we target a dividend payout of 40 to 50 of net earnings we paid in excess of that range in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased expenses from our business transformation project we believe as we realize benefits from this project our dividend payout will return to this targeted range dividends paid were  6483 million or  110 per share in fiscal 2013   6229 million or  106 per share in fiscal 2012 and  5971 million or  102 per share in fiscal 2011    in may 2013  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 o f 028 per s hare which was paid in july 2013    

  

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions   as of august 14 2013  29477835 s hares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

  

debt activity and borrowing availability 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

we have uncommitted bank lines of credit which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of u p to 950 mi llion of whic h none was outstanding as of june 29 2013 outstanding borrowings under this facility were 40 million as of augu st 14 2013  

  

in september 2012 the company’s irish subsidiary pallas foods entered into a €750 million euro multicurrency revolving credit facility which will be utilized for capital needs for the company’s european subsidiaries this facility replaces the subsidiary’s 

 

previous €100 mi llion euro committed facility for unsecured borrowings the new facility provides for unsecured borrowings and expires september 25 2013 but is subject to extension outstanding borrowings under this facility wer e €320 mi llion euro as of june 29 2013 located within notes payable on the consolidated balance sheet outstanding borrowings under this facility were €320 million euro as of august 14 2013 

  

on june 30 2011 a canadian subsidiary of sysco entered into a shortterm demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the canadian subsidiary to sysco and sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan the amount borrowed was 1820 million and was repaid in full on july 4 2011 

  

commercial paper and revolving credit facility 

  

we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed  13 billion   

  

in december 2011 we terminated our previously existing revolving credit facility that supported the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs at the same time sysco and one of its subsidiaries sysco international ulc entered into a new 10 billion credit facility supporting the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs this facility provides for borrowings in both us and canadian dollars borrowings by sysco international ulc under the credit agreement are guaranteed by sysco and borrowings by sysco and sysco international ulc under the credit agreement are guaranteed by all the whollyowned subsidiaries of sysco that are guarantors of the company’s senior notes and debentures the original facility in the amount of 10 billion expires on december 29 2016  in december 2012 a portion of the facility was extended for an additional year this extended facility which expires on december 29 2017 is for 9250 million of the original 10 billion facility but is subject to further extension 

  

as of june 29 2013 commercial paper issuances outstanding were 955 million as of august 14 2013 commercial paper issuances outstanding were 760 million  during fiscal 2013  2012 and 2011  aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to  3300 million zero to  5631 million and zero to  3303 million respectively   during fiscal 2013  2012 and 2011  our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 016  016  and 025  respectively 

  

fixed rate debt 

  

included in current maturities of longterm debt as of june 29 2013 are the 46 senior notes totaling 2000 million which mature in march 2014 it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through cash on hand cash flow from operations issuances of commercial paper senior notes or a combination thereof 

  

in february 2012  we filed with the sec an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities and guarantees of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 

  

in june 2012 we repaid the 61 senior notes totaling 2000 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

  

in may 2012 we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of 2000 million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the then forecasted june 2012 debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate in june 2012 in conjunction with the issuance of the 4500 million senior notes maturing in fiscal 2022 we settled the treasury lock locking in the effective yields on the related debt upon settlement we received cash of 07 million which represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of settlement this amount is being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the 10year term of the debt and the unamortized balance is reflected as a gain net of tax accumulated other comprehensive loss 

  

in june 2012  we issued 055  senior notes totaling  3000 million due june 12 2015 the 2015 notes and 26  senior notes totaling  4500 million due june 12 2022 the 2022 notes under its february 2012 shelf registration the 2015 and 2022 notes which were priced at 99319  and 98722  of par respectively are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions refinancing of debt working capital share repurchases and capital expenditures 

  

in february 2013 we repaid the 42 senior notes totaling 2500 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand 

  

 

in august 2013 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 500 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2018 to floating rate debt this transaction was entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and was designated as a fair value hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

  

total debt 

  

total debt as of june 29 2013 was  30 billion of which approximately 88  was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 47  and an average life of 13 years and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 14  and an average li fe of one year   certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders including provisions to maintain the company’s longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level  we are currently in compliance wi th all debt covenants 

  

other 

  

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements in addition in connection with our audits in certain tax jurisdictions we have posted of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process as of june 29 2013  letters of credit outstanding were  422 million 

  

other considerations  multiemployer pension plans 

  

as discussed in note 14  “ multiemployer employee benefit plans ” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

  

under certain circumstances including our voluntary withdrawal or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from certain underfunded plans we would be required to make payments to the plans for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities we believe that one of the abovementioned events is reasonably possible with certain plans in which we participate and estimate our share of withdrawal liability for these plans could have been as much as 800 million as of june 29 2013 and as much as 900 million as of august 14 2013 based on the latest available information available as of each date this estimate excludes plans for which we have recorded withdrawal liabilities or where the likelihood of the abovementioned events is deemed remote due to the lack of current information we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate 

  

required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition pensionrelated legislation in the united states requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations borrowing capacity or a combination of these items   

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

 

contractual obligations 

  

the following table sets forth as of june 29 2013  certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

  



  

  

1 the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement ages and payout periods 

  

2 includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fisc al 2023 based o n actuarial assumptions 

  

3 represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements 

  

4   unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions as of june 29 2013  we had a liability of  1083 million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and  368 million for related interest that could result in cash payment we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of noncurrent payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time accordingly the related noncurrent balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 

  

5 includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june 29 2013  assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates the impact of our outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june 29 2013  

  

6 provides the estimated minimum contribution to the retirement plan through fisc al 2023 t o meet erisa minimum funding requirements under the assumption that we only make minimum funding requirement contributions each year based on actuarial assumptions 

  

7 for purposes of this table purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative   such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates   purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third party service providers to provide information technology services for period up to fisca l 2016 se e discussion under note 20  “commitments and contingencies” to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments   purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 

  

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved   aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 29 2013   were    10 8 0 million    this amount is not included in the table above  

  

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations   these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain   we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure   our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors   we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods   allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries   in addition in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected   our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

  

selfinsurance program 

  

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs   the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers   we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions   projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends   in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

  

companysponsored pension plans 

  

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets our retirement plan was frozen in fiscal 2013 and is only open to a small number of employees our serp was frozen in fiscal 2013 due to these plan freezes our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is no longer a critical assumption 

  

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan   the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate   the discount rate for determining fiscal 2013 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 30 2012 measurement date decreased 113 basis points to 481    the discount rate for determining fiscal 2013 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 30 2012 measurement date decreased 104 basis points to 489      the serp was remeasured during fiscal 2013 upon approval to freeze the plan the remeasured discount rate was 396 the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2013 by an estimated  87 7 million   the discount rate for determining fiscal 2014 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 29 2013 measurement date increased   51 basis points to 532    the discount rate for determining fiscal 2014 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 29 2013 measurement date in creased 98 basis points to 494   as compared to the discount rate upon the remeasurement of the plan during fiscal 2013    the combined effect of these discount rate changes will de crease our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2014 by an estimated  50 million a 100 basis point increase  or decrease    in the discount rates for fiscal 2014 would de crease  or in crease  sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by 101 million now that sysco’s pension plans are frozen net companysponsored pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to when these plans were active   

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 775  for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012  the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments   although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 

 

74  74  28  and 154 over th e 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2012  respectively   in addition in eight of the last 15 years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10    the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

  

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 775  for fiscal 2014    a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2014 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2014 by approximately  249 million 

  

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 29 2013 was a charge net of tax of  5752 million the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 30 2012 was a charge net of tax of  8239 million 

  

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of  936 million and  1624 million in fiscal years 2013 and 2012  respectively the 700 million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal 2013 was voluntary as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2012 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements the 1400 million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal 2012 exceeded the minimum required contribution for the calendar 2011 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirement s there are no required contributions to the retirement plan to meet erisa minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2014 the estimated fiscal 2014 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately  26   million  

  

income taxes 

  

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws   our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions   jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

  

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected   an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution   a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

  

vendor consideration 

  

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco   there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors   in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound   in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold   in some instances vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold our inventory turnover is usually less than one month therefore amounts deferred against inventory do not require longterm estimation in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized historically adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant    

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

  

in addition annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our ten operating segments as described in note 21  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  the components within each of our ten operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into ten reporting units  

  

 

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models   the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our ten operating segments   we use a 60  weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and 40  for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant    the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements  when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units   

  

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment l oss   there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2013 2012 or   2011 our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2012 and 2011 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2013 analysis our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis however we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for the following reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts first  our specialty produce operations would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 30  lower   second  our european broadline company would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 37  lower a s of   june 29 2013  these two reporting units had goodwill aggregating  3810 million for the remainder of our reporting units  which a s of   june 29 2013 had goodwill aggregating  15 billion we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 48   

  

certain reporting units  caribbean broadline european broadline specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products  imported specialty products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the united states broadline canadian broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the united states broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the united states broadline reporting unit as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we provide compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plan and various nonemployee director plans 

  

as of june 29 2013  there was  694 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements   that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 241 years 

  

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model   expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors   we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes   expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant   the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

  

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 

  

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

  

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

  

 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period   the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

  

o ur sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period     w e will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

  

in addition certain of our   sharebased   awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement   in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

  

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes   in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options   we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option   in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate   

  

  

forwardlooking statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

  

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

  

fiscal 2013 

  

as of june 29 2013  we had 955 million of commercial paper outstanding total debt as of june 29 2013 was  29 billion of which approximately 88  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement 

  

in fiscal 2010 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted 250 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 the fiscal 2013 swap and 200 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 the fiscal 2014 swap to floating rate debt both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates the swap agreement related to the fiscal 2013 debt was settled upon maturity of the senior notes in february 2013 leaving one remaining outstanding swap agreement as of june 29 2013 

  

as of june 29 2013  the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized a s an asset withi n the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of 30 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46  and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly 

  

 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of june 29 2013 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents

fiscal 2012 

  

as of june 30 2012  we had no commercial paper outstanding total debt as of june 30 2012 was  30 billion of which approximately 84  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

  

in may 2012 we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of 2000 million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the june 2012 forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate in june 2012 in conjunction with the issuance of the 4500 million senior notes maturing in fiscal 2022 we settled the treasury lock locking in the effective yields on the related debt 

  

as of june 30 2012  the fiscal 2013 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of 25 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 42  and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly  as of june 30 2012 the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of  62 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46  and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly 

  

 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of june 30 2012 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact   on sales in fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 201 2 or in fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011  the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share w as not material in fi scal 2013   or fiscal 2012  a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2013 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2013 sales by 11  and woul d not have materially impa cted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share  we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

  

fuel price risk 

  

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 07 0 7  and 06  of sales respectively fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges incurred by s ysco increased by   approximately  189 million   in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 and by  398   million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 

  

we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 29 2013  we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately  204 million throu gh august 2014 thes e contracts will lock in the price of approximate ly 60 to 65 of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slight ly lower t han the current market price for diesel 

  

 

assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2014 fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expect ed to increase by approximately 10 to 20 million as compared to fiscal 2013 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2014 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates a 10  unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price use d in our estimates above would result in a potentia l increase of 20 million to 30 million 

  

investment risk 

  

our companysponsored qualified pension   p lan retirement plan holds investments in public and private equity  fixed income securities and real estate funds  the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability  f luctuations in asset values can caus e the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase   and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend  which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments h e ld by our companysponsored retirement plan at the plan’s fiscal year end december 31 2012  wo uld not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2014 however this unfavorable change would increa se our pension expense for fiscal 2014 by  268 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 29 2013 by  1551 million

sysco provides food and related products to the foodservice or foodawayfromhome industry under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined by accounting standards broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to their customers sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to chain restaurant customer locations our other segments include our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers specialty produce companies distribute fresh produce and on a limited basis other foodservice products our lodging industry products company distributes personal care guest amenities equipment housekeeping supplies room accessories and textiles to the lodging industry selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in note 21  “business segment information ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8

we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

  







 





  

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

  



  

1 sales are less than 1 of total 

  

our distribution centers which we refer to as operating companies  distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for s ysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

  

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through our approximately   13600 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

  

no single customer accounted   for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 

  

based upon available information we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

  



  

sources of supply 

  

we purchase from thousands of suppliers  both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

  

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the 

 

suppliers participating in these   consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers this includes the construction and operation of regional distribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region currently  we have two rdcs in operation one in virginia and one in florida  

  

working capital practices 

  

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources” at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

  

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

  

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

  

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

  

corporate headquarters and shared services center 

  

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance treasury legal cash management information technology employee benefits engineering real estate and construction risk management and insurance sales and marketing distribution payroll human resources training and development strategy and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

  

our shared services center perform s support services for employees suppliers and customers payroll administration human resources customer and vendor contract administration financial services such as vendor payments invoicing cash application certain credit services accounting and sales and use tax administration procurement and maintenance support and sales support for some of our operating companies 

  

capital improvements 

  

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to modernize expand and construct new distribution facilities during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately  7845 million  6364 million and  5946 million respectively were invested in technology facilities delivery fleet and other capital asset enhancements we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 should be in the range of  600 million to  650 million during the three years ended june 30 2012 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expec t to finance our fiscal 2013 capital expenditures from the same sources 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2012 we had approximately 47800 full time employees approximately 17  of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters  contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 17  of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which have expired or will expire during fiscal 2013 and are subject to renegotiation since june 30 2012  one contract covering 48 of such employees has been renegotiated we consider our labor relations to be s atisfactory 

  

competition 

  

industry sources estimate that there are more than 15000 companies engaged in foodservice distribution in the united states our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors a few organizations compete with us on a national basis we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices  an additional competitive factor for our larger chain restaurant customers is the ability to provide a national distribution network we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve abo ut 175 of this approximately 225 billio n annual market we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the united states and canada foodawayfromhome   industry 

 

were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2012  while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respectiv e trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our more than 8000 marketing associates our diversified product base which includes a differentiated group of high quality sysco brand products the diversity in the types of customers we serve our economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time and provides a national distribution network for larger chain restaurant customers we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements we are the only publiclytraded distributor in the foodawayfromhome industry in the united states while our public company status provides us with some advantages including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

  

government regulation 

  

as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda as well as the canadian food and drugs act and the regulations thereunder 

  

the fda regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials  and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences  for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

  

in canada the canadian food inspection agency administers and enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards established by health canada under the canadian food and drugs act and under other related federal legislation including the canada agricultural products act the meat inspection act the fish inspection act and the consumer packaging and labe l ling act as it relates to food these laws regulate the processing storing grading packaging marking transporting and inspection of certain sysco product lines as well as the packaging labeling sale importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products 

  

we and our products are also subject to state provincial and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state provincial and local health agencies of state provincial and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor together with similar occupational health and safety laws in each canadian province these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

  

we are also subject to regulation by numerous us and canadian federal state provincial and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor and each canadian provincial ministry of labour which set employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation and the canadian transportation agency which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

  

most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks although we are subject to o ther us and canadian federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials  these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

  

compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

 

general 

  

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco ® trademark and our privatelybranded product trademarks that include the sysco ® trademark these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry approximately half of our privatelybranded sales are from products labeled with our sysco ® trademark without any other trademark we believe the loss of the sysco ® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our us trademarks are effective for a ten  year period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration date s unless a particular trademark is no longer in use the company does not have any material patents or licenses 

  

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

  

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

  

as of june 30 2012 we operated 185 distribution facilities throughout the united states canada and ireland 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business operations financial position or future financial performance this information should be read in conjunction with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report the following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are the most significant factors to consider when evaluating our business these factors could cause our future results to differ from our expectations expressed in the forwardlooking statements identified on page 39 and from historical trends 

  

industry and general economic risks 

  

periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and may negatively impact our profitability 

  

volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability in addition product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer spending decisions which could adversely impact our sales conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant our estimate for the inflation in sysco’s cost of goods was 55  in fiscal 2012 compared to estimated inflation of 46 in fiscal 2011 and deflation of 15 in fiscal 2010 

  

our results and financial condition are directly affected by the volatility in the global economic environment and local market conditions and low consumer confidence which can adversely affect our sales margins and net income 

  

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins and is especially susceptible to trends in economic activity such as the recent global recession the global economic environment has been characterized by weak economies persistently high unemployment rates inflationary pressures and extreme volatility in financial markets worldwide which has been exacerbated by the significant uncertainty associated with the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in certain eurozone countries in addition our results of operations are substantially affected by local operating and economic conditions which can vary substantially by market the difficult economic conditions can affect us in the following ways 

  







  

this environment has adversely affected both business and consumer confidence and spending and uncertainty about the longterm investment environment could further depress capital investment and economic activity     

 

  

competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers and makes it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability 

  

the foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive with numerous regional and local competitors and is a mature industry characterized by slowing revenue growth additionally new competition could arise from nontraditional sources group purchasing organizations or consolidation among competitors new competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting such competition may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

  

increased competition within the industry and general economic conditions have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability although our sales historically have grown faster than the market in recent years we have experienced slowing revenue growth these trends have placed pressure on our profit margins and made it more difficult to achieve growth and pass along cost increases we expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our market share sales and profitability through increased expenditures or decreased prices could be adversely impacted 

  

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and forward purchase commitments intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs 

  

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past there is no guarantee that we can do so again if another period of high fuel costs occurs if fuel costs increase again in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the thencurrent market price for diesel if fuel prices decrease significantly these forward purchases may prove ineffective and result in us paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel 

  

business and operational risks 

  

our ability to meet our longterm strategic objectives to grow the profitability of our business depends largely on the success of the business transformation project 

  

in fiscal 2009 we commenced our business transformation project which currently consists of three main components 

  







  

although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the longterm the costs exceeded the benefits during the testing stages of implementation of erp including in fiscal 2012 we believe the costs will exceed the benefits in fiscal 2013 successfully managing deployment is critical to our business success while we expect all three components of the business transformation project to enhance our value proposition to customers and suppliers and improve our longterm profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established if at all 

  

the actual cost of the erp system may be greater or less than currently expected and delays in the execution of deployment may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multiyear timeframe our cost estimates related to our erp system are based on assumptions which are subject to wide variability require a great deal of judgment and are inherently uncertain thus the actual costs of the project in 

 

fiscal 2013 and beyond may be greater or less than currently expected for example as we continue implementation of the project we have encountered and we may continue to encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget including incurring expenses at an earlier or later time than currently anticipated in addition implementation of the systems require significant management attention and resources over an extended period of time and any significant design errors or delay in the implementation of the systems could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business delays in deployment additional operating problems discovered in the underlying information technology systems’ processes cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition because the implementation is expected to continue to involve a significant capital commitment our business results of operations and liquidity may also be adversely affected if the erp system and the associated process changes do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate there can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize the intended results of the system software and implementation activities we expect costs to continue to outweigh benefits for fiscal 2013 as we commence deployment 

  

we may not realize anticipated benefits from our cost reduction efforts 

  

we have implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives that we believe are necessary to position our business for future success and growth our future success and earnings growth depend upon our ability to achieve a lower cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity and reduced profitability if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 

  

we may not realize anticipated benefits from our product cost reduction initiative 

  

our product cost reduction initiative will be deployed to use market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment issues this initiative aims to improve our offerings to customers strengthen strategic relationships with suppliers and improve our sales and profit margins the implementation of changes may not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate or at all 

  

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs 

  

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from thirdparty suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us although our purchasing volume can provide benefits when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop conditions product recalls water shortages transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses further increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products in the summer months of 2012 certain agricultural areas of the united states have experienced severe drought the impact of this drought is uncertain and could result in volatile input costs input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

  

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings 

  

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products anything that damages that reputation or the public’s confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of our products could quickly affect our revenues and profits reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact the public’s confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns such as flu epidemics or other pandemics even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically 

  

 

expanding into international markets and complementary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complementary lines of business may not be successful 

  

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations 

  

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complementary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complementary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complementary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

  

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business such as food safety and sanitation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety including regulations of the fda usda us occupational safety and health administration federal motor carrier safety data privacy environmental protection the import and export of goods and customs regulations the false claims act the foreign corrupt practices act and the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot represent that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting seizures or debarments from contracting with the government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

  

product liability claims could materially impact our business 

  

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

  

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively 

  

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

  

 

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact 

  

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

  

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position 

  

  as of june 30 2012 we had approximately 3 billion of total indebtedness we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billion a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs in the amount of 10 billion set to expire on december 29 2016 and certain uncommitted bank lines of credit providing for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to  950 million in june 2012 we issued 750 million in senior notes which contributed to an increase in our total indebtedness our indebtedness may further increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures our increased level of indebtedness and the ultimate cost of such indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of capital and financial results 

  

technology dependence could have a material negative impact on our business 

  

  our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs furthermore process changes will be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing delivery and payroll systems to support operations as we implement the erp system while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits 

  

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans 

  

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 10 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2012 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 68 million which included payments for withdrawal liabilities of 34 million the costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer plans will depend upon many factors including the outcome of collective bargaining actions taken by trustees who manage the plans government regulations the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit  based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded the unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in increased future payments by us and the other participating employers underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan based on the latest information available from plan administrators we estimate our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 205 million as of june 30 2012 a significant increase to funding requirements could adversely affect the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

our funding requirements for our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase and our earnings may decrease should financial markets experience future declines 

  

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability our expense is also impacted by these items fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet at fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our discount rate at fiscal yearend specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our required contributions and pension expense may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations 

 

  

at the end of fiscal 2012 we   decided to freez e future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december 31 20 12 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees  effective january 1 2013 these employees will be eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan while these actions will serve to limit future growth in our pension liabilities we had a sizable pension obligation of 27 billion as of june 30 2012 which could continue to impact our funding requirements and our earnings additionally although recent pension funding relief legislation has served to defer some required funding additional contributions may be required if our plan is not fully funded when the provisions that provided the relief are phased out see note 13 “companysponsored employee benefit plans” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the funded status of the retirement plan 

  

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages 

  

as of june 30 2012 approximately 8200 employees at 50 operating companies were members of 53 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2013 15   agreements covering approximately 1400   employees have expired or will expire since june 30 2012 one   contract covering   48   of the approximately 1400   employees has been renegotiated failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings 

  

our operations rely heavily on our employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

  

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders 

  

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

overview 

  

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are primarily located throughout the united states canada and ireland and include broadline companies which include our customcut meat operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary specialty produce companies hotel supply operations a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers 

  

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about 175 of this approximately 225 billion annual market according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 46 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states 

  

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately 04 in calendar year 2011 and 25 in calendar year 2010 real sales declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

  

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market historically we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and believe we have continued to grow our market share in this fragmented industry 

  

highlights 

  

high levels of product costs and an uneven economic recovery contributed to a challenging business environment in fiscal 2012 our case volume growth has shown modest improvement in a low growth market environment however our earnings declined due to high levels of inflation and rising operating expenses driven in part by our expenses related to our business transformation project

trends and strategy 

  

trends 

  

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income have contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market according to industry sources real sales for the total foodservice market in the united states are not expected to grow significantly over the next year 

  

 

we experienced prolonged levels of high product cost inflation during most of fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 our product cost inflation reached a high of 73 in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and a low of 33 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 while we are generally able to pass on modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable to fully pass through these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin percentage without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business in the summer months of 2012 certain agricultural areas of the united states have experienced severe drought the impact of this drought is uncertain and could result in volatile input costs input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit operating income and earnings 

  

we have experienced higher operating costs this fiscal year some of the increase has resulted from increased payrelated expenses sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes and delivery compensation includes activitybased pay which is driven by case volumes since these drivers are variable in nature increased gross profit dollars and case volumes have increased sales and delivery compensation we believe payrelated expense could continue to increase if gross profit dollars and case volumes increase however the impact of our productivity related initiatives could favorably impact the magnitude of this trend fuel costs are expected to stabilize provided that fuel prices do not significantly change from their current levels our business transformation project is a key part of our strategy to control costs and grow our market share over the longterm this project includes an integrated software system that went into deployment in august 2012 we believe expenses related to the project will increase in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to amortization of the software asset and increased deployment costs 

  

net companysponsored pension costs for our retirement plan have experienced volatility over the past five years primarily due to changes in interest rates which are used to determine the discount rates for our pension obligations and our pension asset performance for most of these periods we have experienced significantly increased pension expense at the end of fiscal 2012 sysco decided to freez e future benefit accruals under the retirement plan   as of december 31 20 12   for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees  effective january 1 2013 these employees will be eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan p ension costs will decrease in fiscal 2013 primarily due to this plan freeze our expenses related to our defined contribution plan will increase in fiscal 2013 and will more than offset our reduced pension costs however over the longterm we believe the changes to both plans will result in reduced volatility of retirement related expenses and a reduction in total retirement related expenses 

  

strategy 

  

we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the us and canada while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business daytoday our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service with the aspirational vision of becoming each of our customers’ most valued and trusted business partner we have identified five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision 

  



  



 



  



  



  

business transformation project 

  

in fiscal 2009 we commenced our business transformation project which currently consists of three main components 

  







  

in fiscal 2012 we continued to refine our erp system after implementing it at two pilot operating companies the system has been deployed to three operating companies and we are targeting to convert 5 to 15 us broadline operating companies in fiscal 2013 our next five conversions will be in texas and louisiana we believe future conversions will be 15 to 25 us broadline operating companies per year from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2016 although we expect the investment in the erp system within our business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the longterm the costs will exceed the benefits during fiscal 2013 

  

expenses related to the business transformation project were 1931 million in fiscal 2012 or 021 per share 1026 million in fiscal 2011 or 011 per share and 811 million in fiscal 2010 or 009 per share we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal 2013 will continue to significantly increase primarily due to the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in august 2012 our costs will also increase from the ramp up of our shared services center continuing costs for deployment of the software platform and information technology support costs some of these increased costs will be partially offset by benefits obtained from the project primarily in reduced headcount however the costs will exceed the benefits in fiscal 2013 

  

our cost transformation initiative seeks to lower our cost structure by 300 million to 350 million annually by fiscal 2015 these include initiatives to increase our productivity in the warehouse and delivery activities including fleet management and maintenance activities it also involves improving sales productivity and reducing general and administrative expenses partially through aligning compensation and benefit plans   

  

our   product cost reduction initiative is designed to lower our total product costs by 250 million to 300 million annually by fiscal 2015 this initiative involves the use of market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment we believe there are opportunities to more effectively provide the products that our customers want to benefit from our purchasing power and to create mutually beneficial partnerships with our suppliers we believe that procuring greater quantities with select vendors will result in reduced prices for our product purchases 

  

we expect our expenses related to the business transformation project for fiscal 2013 to be approximately 300 million to 350 million net of benefits obtained from our shared services center we expect our capital expenditures related to this project to be approximately 5 million to 20 million in fiscal 2013 we believe we can obtain approximately 25 of the total expected annualized benefits of 550 million to 650 million if we are successful in obtaining these benefits in fiscal 2013 some of the trends noted above could be favorably impacted 

  

 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 



  

the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 











  

  

1   other expense income net was income of  68 million in fiscal 2012  income of  142 million in fiscal 2011   and expense of  08 million in fiscal 2010  

  

sales 

  

sales for fiscal 2012 were 78  higher   than fiscal 2011 sales for fiscal 2012   increased as a result of product cost inflation  and the resulting increase in selling prices  along with improving case volumes changes in product cost an internal measure of inflation were approximately 55  during fiscal 2012  case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 30 during fiscal 2012 case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 25 during fiscal 2012 our case volumes represent our results from our broadline and sygma segments only sales from acquisitions in the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 07  for fiscal 2012  the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact   on sales when compared to fiscal 201 1  

  

sales for fiscal 2011 were 56 higher than fiscal 2010 after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 the adjusted increase in sales in fiscal 2011 would have been 77  sales for fiscal 2011   increased as a result of product cost inflation  and the resulting increase in selling prices  along with improving case volumes estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were approximately 46 during fiscal 2011 case volumes including acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 41 during fiscal 2011 case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last 12 months improved approximately 34 

 

during fiscal 2011 sales from acquisitions in the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 07 for fiscal 2011 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 05 compared to fiscal 2010 

operating income 

  

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 

  

fiscal 2012 vs fiscal 2011 

  

operating income decreased 21 in f iscal 201 2 over fiscal 201 1 to  19 billion and as a percentage of sales decreased to 45  of sales this decrease was primarily driven by declines in gross margin and increased operating expenses partially from increased expenses from payroll and our b usiness t ransformation p roject  these expense increases were partially offset by increases in gross profit dollars  gross profit dollars increas ed 38  in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011  and operating expenses increased   59  in fiscal 201 2 as compared to fiscal 2011  adjusted operating income increased 30 or 609 million during fiscal 2012 

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 201 2 as compared to fiscal 201 1 primarily due to increased sales gross margin  which is gross profit as a percentage of sales  was 1811  in fiscal 201 2  a decline of 69 basis points from the gross margin of 1880 in fiscal 201 1  this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation   other factors contributing to our gross margin decline were competitive pressures on pricing segment mix changes where certain of our lower margin segments grew faster than our broadline segment and our own strategy to gain market share 

  

sysco’s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of 55  during fiscal 201 2  based on our product sales mix for fiscal 201 2  we were most impacted by higher levels of infla tion in the   meat canned and dry and frozen product categories in the range of 6  to 8  our product cost inflation reached a high of 73 in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and a low of 33 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable to fully pass through these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business in the summer months of 2012 certain agricultural areas of the united states have experienced severe drought the impact of this drought is uncertain and could result in volatile input costs input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels prolonged periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit and earnings o ur   product cost reduction initiative is designed to lower our total product costs by 250 million to 300 million annually by fiscal 2015 however we believe the impact on our product costs in fiscal 2013   will be modest  

  

g ross profit dollars for fiscal 201 2   a lso increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 475 million higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 due to higher fuel pr ices incurred during fiscal 201 2 and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for the entire fiscal period  assuming that fuel prices do not greatly vary from recent levels we expect the level of fuel surcharges in fiscal 2013 to remain consistent with those experienced in fiscal 2012 

  

operating expenses for fiscal 201 2 increased 59 pri marily due to increased payrelated expenses increased expenses related to our business transformation project increased fuel costs and an unfavorable yearoveryear comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values as compared to the prior year period these increases were partially offset by decreases in n et companysponsored pension costs and lower provisions related to multiemployer pension plans  adjusted operating expenses increased 41 or 2210 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 

  

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project increased by 1537 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation and added costs from companies acquired within the last 12 months sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes and delivery compensation includes activitybased pay which is driven by case volumes  since these drivers are variable in nature  increased gross profit dollars and cases volumes will increase sales and delivery compensation  however the impact of our productivity related initiatives could favorably impact the magnitude of this trend also contributing to the increase was a restructuring charge related to severance incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 of 64 million 

  

expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated expense were 1931 million in fiscal 2012 and 1026 million in fiscal 2011 representing an increase of 905 million the increase in fiscal 2012 resulted from increased project spending  reduced capitalization of expenditures   and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal 2013 will continue to increase primarily due to the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in august 2012 additionally the majority of the expenditures forecasted for fiscal 2013 will be expensed as the company is in the deployment phase of the project we believe the increase in project expenses including all payrelated expenses 

 

related to the business transformation project in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 will be approximately  105   million to  155   million 

  

f uel costs increased by  398 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices our costs per gallon increased 130  in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011  our activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices 

  

our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods in fiscal 201 2  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated  202 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2011 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 164 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 

  

as of june 30 2012  we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately  96 million throu gh april 2013 subsequent to june 30 2012 we entered into forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately  20 million for may and june 201 3  these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 35  to 45  of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices higher than the current market price for diesel assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2013 fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are not expected to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal 2012 o ur estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2013 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 

  

we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments which through fiscal 2011 included publicly traded securities as a result the cash surrender values of these policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such securities the changes in the financial markets resulted i n gains for these policies of  282 million in fiscal 2011    near the end of fiscal 2011 we reallocated all of our policies into lowrisk fixedincome securities to reduce earnings volatility and therefore our adjustments for fiscal 2012 were not significant    beginning with fiscal 2013 there should be no significant yearoveryear impact from coli adjustments as compared to fiscal 2013 

  

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2012 wer e 273 million lower than i n fiscal 201 1  the decrease in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to higher returns on assets of sysco’s retirement plan obtained in fiscal 2011 at the end of fiscal 2012 sysco decided to freez e future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december 31 20 12 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees  effective january 1 2013 these employees will be eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 201 3 have been determined as of the fiscal 201 2 yearend measurement date and will decrease b y approximately  265 million in fiscal 2013 our expenses related to our defined contribution plan will increase approximately 45 million to 55 million in fiscal 2013 the decline in pension cost will occur evenly over fiscal 2013 however the increased defined contribution expenses will occur in the last half of fiscal 2013 when these enhancements go into effect over the longterm we believe the changes to both plans will result in reduced volatility of retirement related expenses and a reduction in total retirement related expenses   absent the retirement plan freeze discussed above net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2013 would have increased 1069 million instead of decreasing 265 million 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in the last two fiscal years we voluntary withdrew from several multiemployer plans and recorded provisions of  219 million in fiscal 2012 and  415 million in fiscal 2011  

  

we also measure our expense performance on a cost per case basis which we seek to align with the gross profit that we are able to generate for our broadline companies our cost per case increased 004 per case as compared to fiscal 2011 these increases primarily related to increased payroll costs and fuel costs discussed above 

  

fiscal 201 1 vs fiscal 201 0 

  

operating income decreased 22 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 to 19 billion and as a percentage of sales declined to 49 of sales the decrease was driven by the absence of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2011 gross profit dollars growing at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increasing faster than gross profit partially due to charge of  415 million from withdrawal s from multiemployer pension plan s  gross profit dollars increased 29 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and operating expenses increased 48 in fiscal 2011 adjusted operating income increased 25 or 50 8 million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 

  

 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased sales partially offset by the negative comparison of the additional week included in fiscal 2010 gross margin was 1880 in fiscal 2011 a decline of 50 basis points from the gross margin of 1930 in fiscal 2010 this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the following factors described in the paragraphs below 

  

first sysco’s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of 46 during fiscal 2011 based on our product sales mix for fiscal 2011 we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy meat and seafood product categories in the range of 10 to 12 our largest selling product category canned and dry experienced inflation of 4 

  

second ongoing strategic pricing initiatives in fiscal 2011 lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in shortterm gross profit declines as a percentage of sales but we believe will result in longterm gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented we believe the longterm benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 

  

third gross profit dollars for fiscal 2011 increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 260 million higher in fiscal 2011 than in the comparable prior year period due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal 2011 and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter 

  

operating expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 48 primarily due to higher payrelated expense an increase in net companysponsored pension costs provisions for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and higher fuel costs as compared to the prior year period the impact of these operating expense increases was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately  1014 million resulting from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 201 0  adjusted operating expense increased 59 or  298 8 million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 

  

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project increased by  611 million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation payrelated expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase partially offsetting these increases were lower provisions for current management incentive bonuses of  139 million 

  

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2011 were  603 million higher than in fiscal 201 0  the increase in fiscal 201 1 was due primarily to a decrease in discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense at the end of fiscal 2010 partially offset by reduced amortization of our net actuarial loss resulting from actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of sysco’s retirement plan during fiscal 2010 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 we voluntary withdrew from several multiemployer plans and recorded provisions of  415 million in fiscal 2011 and  29 million in fiscal 2010  

  

f uel costs increased by  330 million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices our costs per gallon increased 143  in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010  our forward fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods in fiscal 2011 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 164 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 201 0  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 1 5 million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes for a portion of the fiscal year  

  

for our broadline companies our cost per case increased 011 per case as compared to fiscal 2010 these increases primarily related to increased payroll costs increased fuel costs and charges created by withdrawing from multiemployer plans all of which are discussed above 

  

net earnings 

  

net earnings for fiscal 2012   decreased 2 6  over the comparable prior year period this decrease was primarily due to changes in operating income discussed above  adjusted net earnings increased 47 during fiscal 2012   

  

net earnings for fiscal 2011 decreased 24 over the comparable prior year period this decrease was primarily due to the absence of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2011 the factors discussed above and an increase in the effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 3696 compared to an effective tax rate of 3620 for fiscal 2010 the difference between the tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from the onetime reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies related to our settlement with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 adjusted net earnings increased 3 6 during fiscal 2011 

 

  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 201 2   was 3713  indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory tax rates less than our domestic tax rate had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 

  

the effective tax rate of 3696 for fiscal 2011 was favorably impacted primarily by two items first we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 170 million for the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards second we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values the gain of 282 million recorded in fiscal 2011 was primarily nontaxable for income tax purposes and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by 111 million partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the recording of 93 million in tax and interest related to various federal foreign and state uncertain tax positions 

  

the effective tax rate of 3620 for fiscal 2010 was favorably impacted primarily by two items first we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately 290 million resulting from the onetime reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement with the irs see note 18  “income taxes” for additional discussion second the gain of 216 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal 2010 was nontaxable for income tax purposes and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by 83 million 

  

  earnings per share 

  

basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 were  1 91 and 190 respectively this represents a 26 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for basic earnings per share of 196 per share and a 31 decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for diluted earnings per share of 196 this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above adjusted diluted earnings per share was 213 in fiscal 2012 and 204 in fiscal 2011 or an increase of 44  

  

basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 15 in fiscal 2011 from the prior year this de crease was primarily the result of the absence of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2011 and the factors discussed above as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in both average and diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases which occurred during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2011 adjusted diluted earnings per share were 204 in fiscal 2011 and 195 in fiscal 2010 or an increase of 46   

  

nongaap reconciliations 

  

sysco’s results of operations are impacted by costs from our multiyear business transformation project btp significant charges from the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan mepp restructuring charges and recognized tax benefits additionally near the end of fiscal 2011 we reallocated all of our investments in our coli policies into lowrisk fixedincome securities and therefore we do not expect significant volatility in operating expenses operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share in future periods related to these policies we experienced significant gains in these policies during fiscal 2011 management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove the impact of the business transformation project expenses multiemployer pension plan charges restructuring charges coli gains and tax benefits provides an important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company’s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a yearover year basis 

  

in addition sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30 th  this resulted in a 52week year ending june 30 2012 for fiscal 2012 a 52week year ending july 2 2011 for fiscal 2011 and a 53week year ending july 3 2010 for fiscal 2010 because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2011 our r esults of o perations for fiscal 2010 are not directly comparable to fiscal 2011  management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2010 r esults of o perations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis as a result in the nongaap reconciliation below for fiscal 201 1 compared to fiscal 2010   in addition to the specific line item impacts noted above operating items have been adjusted by onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010  failure to make these adjustments would cause the yearoveryear changes in certain metrics such as sales operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated whereas in certain cases a metric may actually have increased rather than declined or declined rather than increased on a more comparable yearoveryear basis 

  

the company uses these nongaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company’s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any nongaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the tables below each period presented is adjusted to remove expenses related to the business transformation project significant charges incurred from the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan restructuring charges gains recorded on the adjustments to the carrying value of coli policies and to remove the impact of tax benefits in fiscal 2011 in addition fiscal 2010 results are adjusted to remove the estimate impact of the 53 rd week

segment results 

  

we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k  intersegment sales represent specialty produce and imported specialty products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies  

  

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results  corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and sysco’s shared service center these also include all sharebased compensation costs and expenses related to the company’s business transformation project while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in gross profits expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

  

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with note 21  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with note 21 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

1 sygma had operating income of  610 million in fiscal 2012   622 million in fiscal 2011 and  491 million in fiscal 2010  

  

the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment and intersegment sales expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales including intersegment sales and operating income respectively for purposes of this statistical table operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of  6776 million in fiscal 2012   5588 million in fiscal 2011 and  5133 million in fiscal 2010 that are not charged to our segments this information should be read in conjunction with not e 21 “ business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  

  



  

 

broadline segment 

  

the broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company’s united states canadian and european broadline segments broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers and also provide customcut meat operations  broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2012  the broadline operating results represented approximately 812  of sysco’s overall sales and 941  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses 

  

there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segment’s earnings 

  

sales 

  

sales for fiscal 2012 were 78  greater than fiscal 2011  product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices combined with case volume improvement contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal 2012  changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 57  in fiscal 2012  noncomparable acquisitions contributed 07  to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2012  the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negative ly impacted sales by 01 compared to fiscal 2011 

  

sales for fiscal 2011 were 51 greater than fiscal 2010 negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 was the additional week in fiscal 2010 product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices combined with case volume improvement contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal 2011 changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 49 in fiscal 2011 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 08 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2011 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 06 compared to fiscal 2010 

  

operating income 

  

operating income increased by 38  in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 this increase was driven by gross profit dollars increasing more than operating expenses  

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased sales  however gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation and competitive pressures on pricing based on broadline’s product sales mix for fiscal 2012  we   were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the meat canned and dry and frozen product categories  while we are generally able to p ass through modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business in the summer months of 2012 certain agricultural areas of the united states have experienced severe drought the impact of this drought is uncertain and could result in volatile input costs input costs could increase at any point in time for a large portion of the products that we sell for a prolonged period while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels prolonged periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact the broadline segment’s sales gross profit and earnings o ur   product cost reduction initiative is designed to lower our total product costs by 250 million to 300 million annually by fiscal 2015 however we believe the impact on our product costs in fiscal 2013   will be modest  

  

in addition gross profit dollars for fiscal 2012 increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately  391 million higher in fiscal 2012 than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base during fiscal 2012 due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods assuming that fuel prices do not greatly vary from recent levels we expect the level of fuel surcharges in fiscal 2013 to remain consistent with those experienced in fiscal 2012 

  

operating expenses for the broadline segment increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the expense increases in fiscal 2012 were driven largely by an increase in payrelated expenses and fuel costs partially offset by a favorable comparison in the provisions recorded for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans in each fiscal year sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes and delivery compensation includes activitybased pay which is driven by case volumes since these drivers are variable in nature increased gross profit dollars and case volumes will increase sales and delivery compensation however the impact of our productivity related initiatives could favorably impact the magnitude of this trend fuel costs were 265 million higher in fiscal 2012 than the prior year assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2013 fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are not expected to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal 2012 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2013 and estimates of fuel 

 

consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 

  

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans we recorded provisions related to the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans of  219 million in fiscal 2012 and  415 million in fiscal 2011 

  

we also measure our expense performance on a cost per case basis  which we seek to align with the gross profit that we are able to generate for our broadline companies our cost per case increased 00 4 per case as compared to fiscal 2011 and 0 11 per case as compared to fiscal 2010 the increases in both periods primarily related to increased fuel costs and payroll costs discussed above charges created by withdrawing from multiemployer plans also contributed to the increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

  

operating income decreased 10  in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 to  23 billion and as a percentage of sales declined to 73  of sales gross profit dollars increased slightly below the rate that operating expenses increased however operating expenses included a significant unfavorable comparison in the provisions recorded for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans in each fiscal year 

  

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased sales however gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales this slower growth in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of two factors first based on broadline’s product sales mix for fiscal 2011 it was most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy meat and seafood product categories in the range of 10 to 12 broadline’s largest selling product category canned and dry experienced inflation of 4 second ongoing strategic pricing initiatives largely lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in shortterm gross profit declines as a percentage of sales but we believe will result in longterm gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented we believe the longterm benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 

  

in addition gross profit dollars for fiscal 2011 increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 194 million higher in fiscal 2011 than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods 

  

the expense increases in fiscal 2011 were driven largely by provisions for withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan an increase in payrelated expenses and increased fuel costs in fiscal 2011 we recorded provisions of 415 million for withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer pension plans from which union members elected to withdraw compared to provisions of 29 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in payrelated expenses was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation portions of our payrelated expense are variable in nature and are expected to increase when sales and gross profit increase payrelated expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase fuel costs were 220 million higher in fiscal 2011 than the prior year 

  

sygma segment 

  

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

  

sales 

  

sales were 74  greater in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011  the increase in sales was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices sales to new customers also contributed to the increase 

  

sales were 92 greater in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 was the additional week in fiscal 2010 the increase in sales was primarily due to case volume improvement largely attributable to new customers and to a lesser extent from an increase in volume from certain existing customers 

  

one chain restaurant customer the wendy’s company a ccounted for approximately 29  of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012  sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

  

 

o perating income 

  

operating income decreased 12 million in 2012 from the prior year due to rising operating expenses gross profit dollars in creased 43 while operating expenses increased 53 in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal 2012 were increased sales and an increase of approximately 83 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2012 from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal 2012 the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2012 was largely driven by increased fuel costs fuel costs in fiscal 2012 were 113 million greater than the prior year assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2013 we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment not to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal 2012 

  

operating income increased 131 million in 2011 over the prior year due to increased sales and improved productivity gross profit dollars increased 95 while operating expenses increased 72 in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal 2011 were increased sales and an increase of approximately 66 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2011 from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal 2011 the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2011 was largely driven by increased delivery and warehouse personnel payroll costs resulting from increased sales as well as increased fuel cost productivity improvements occurred within our warehouse and delivery functions in fiscal 2011 and expense reductions occurred within our administrative functions in fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior year fuel costs in fiscal 2011 were 129 million greater than the prior year 

  

other segment 

  

“other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce and lodging industry products  a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 

  

on an aggregate basis our “other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry except for our lodging supply company  each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in fiscal 2012  in the aggregate the “other” segment represented approximately 57  of sysco’s overall sales and 35  of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses 

  

operating income decreased 92 for fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 the decrease in operating income was caused partially due to increased expenses in our specialty produce segment  

  

operating income increased 143 for fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 the operating income comparison was negatively affected by the additional week in fiscal 2010 the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in the specialty produce segment and favorable expense management in the specialty produce and lodging industry products segments 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

highlights 

  

comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2011 

  













  

sources and uses of cash 

  

sysco’s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to 

  







 







  

any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments or applied toward the cost of the share repurchase program as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

  

we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions uncertain economic conditions and uneven levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income have lowered our sales growth and our cash flows from operations product cost inflation has lowered our gross profit and cash flows from operations as we were unable to pass through all of the increased product costs with the same gross margin to our customers we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital such as credit monitoring optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors and our mechanisms to manage product cost inflation have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations we believe these mechanisms will continue prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations at june 30 2012 we had 6889 million in cash and cash equivalents approximately 20 of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations however we do not currently anticipate the need to relocate this cash 

  

we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

  







  

due to our strong financial position we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and longterm capital markets if necessary we believe our cash flows from operations will improve in fiscal 2013 due to benefits from our business transformation project and initiatives to improve our working capital management 

  

cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

fiscal 2012 vs fiscal 2011 

  

we generated  14 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012  as compared to 11 b illion in fiscal 20 11 the increase of 3127 million between fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was largely attributable to changes in working capital a yearoveryear reduction in tax payments and the redemption of some of our coli policies these increases were partially offset by the yearoveryear impact of multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments these items are more fully described below 

  

changes in working capital  specifically accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable contributed 1443 million to the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 both periods were affected by increases in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable resulting primarily from inflationdriven increases in product cost and sales however fiscal 2012 was impacted by these items to a lesser extent due primarily to working capital improvements within accounts receivable and inventory and also less growth in average daily sales in the final month of fiscal 2012 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2011 

  

tax payments were 1352 million less in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 the decrease in tax payments was partially due to the company being in a prepaid position at the end of fiscal 2011 in certain jurisdictions in addition various movements in taxable temporary differences caused estimated taxable income to be lower in fiscal 2012 requiring less tax payments in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 we made our final payments on a previous irs tax settlement of 212 million in fiscal 2012 the completion of these settlement payments will have a positive impact on our cash flows in fiscal 2013 

  

we received approximately 75 million in cash from the onetime redemption during the period of some of our investments in coli policies that we maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the supplemental executive retirement plan serp this resulted in a positive impact to cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 by decreasing other assets by 571 million those 

 

redeemed coli policies were replaced by less volatile existing corporateowned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the marketdriven coli impact on our earnings 

  

multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments had a negative impact of 533 million on the comparison of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2011 the net impact of withdrawal provisions and payments was a cash outflow of 117 million in fiscal 2012 compared to a 415 million accrual in fiscal 2011 

  

fiscal 201 1 vs fiscal 201 0 

  

we generated  11 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011  as compared to  09 billion in fiscal 2010  the increase of 2061 million between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was driven largely by a reduction in the amount of payments made in relation to the irs settlement of 3160 million and reduced pension contributions in the amount of 136 3 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 these increases were partially offset by changes in working capital   discussed in more detail below 

  

p ayments related to the irs settlement were 2120 million in fiscal 2011 and 5280 million in   fiscal 2010 see further discussion of the irs settlement in note 18  “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8   

  

our contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit plans were  1617 million in fiscal 2011 and  2979 million in fiscal 2010  respectively included in the 1617 million of contributions in fiscal 2011 was a 1400 million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal 2012 included in the 2979 million of contributions in fiscal 2010 was a 1400 million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have bee n made in fiscal 2011 and quarterly contributions totaling 1400 million for fiscal 2010 

  

changes in working capital specifically accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable   reduced cash flow from operations by 2022 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were primarily due to sales growth an increase in daily sales outstanding also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2011 the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was primarily from the growth in inventory resulting from sales growth 

  

investing activities 

  

fiscal 2012 capital expenditures included 

  











  

fiscal 2011 capital expenditures included 

  











  

fiscal 2010 capital expenditures included 

  











  

capital expenditures in fiscal 201 2 increased by 1481 million primarily due to a greater number of new facilities and expansion projects underway this year capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 and 2011 for our business transformation project were 1462 million and 1958 million respectively 

 

  

we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 to be in the range of  600 million to  650 million fiscal 2013 expenditures will include facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions new facility construction including foldout facilities and investments in technology  

  

during fiscal 2012  in the aggregate the company paid cash of  1106 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2012 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2012 we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in sacramento california quebec canada new haven connecticut grand rapids michigan minneapolis minnesota columbia south carolina and spokane washington in addition sysco acquired for cash a company that distributes specialty imported products headquartered in chicago illinois 

  

during fiscal 2011 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 1011 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2011 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2011 we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in central california los angeles california ontario canada lincoln nebraska and trenton new jersey 

  

during fiscal 2010 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 293 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2010 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2010 we acquired for cash a broadline foodservice operation in syracuse new york a produce distributor in atlanta georgia and a seafood distributor in edmonton alberta canada 

  

financing activities 

  

equit y transactions 

  

proceeds from common stock reissued from treasury for sharebased compensation awards were  994 million in fiscal 2012   3327 million in fiscal 2011 and  948 million in fiscal 2010  the increase in proceeds in fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2012 and 2010 the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 

  

we traditionally have engaged in boardapproved share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 10000000 shares for 2723 million in fiscal 2012  10 000000 shares for  2916 million in fiscal 2011 and 6000000 shares for  1792 million in fiscal 2010  there were 75200 additional shares repurchased through august 15  201 2  resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 23311400 shares based on the trades made through that date our current share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our diluted average shares outstanding relatively constant to achieve this goal we believe we will not have to purchase as many shares in fiscal 2013 as were purchased in fiscal 2012 

  

we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company inception over 40 years ago we target a dividend payout of 40 to 50 of net earnings we paid in excess of that range in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased expenses from our business transformation project we believe as we realize benefits from this project our dividend payout will return to this targeted range dividends paid were  6229 million or 10 6 per share in fiscal 2012   5971 million or  102 per share in fiscal 2011 and  5798 million or 09 8 per share in fiscal 2010  in may 2012  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 of  027 per share which was paid in july 2012   

  

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of augu st 15 2012 29477835   shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

  

debt activity and borrowing availability 

  

shortterm borrowings 

  

we have uncommitted bank lines of credit which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to  950 million of which none was outstanding as of june 30 2012 or augu st 15 2012  

  

our irish subsidiary pallas foods limited has a € 100 million euro committed facility for unsecured borrowings for working capital there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of june 30 2012 or aug ust 15   2012  

  

on june 30 2011 a canadian subsidiary of sysco entered into a shortterm demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the canadian subsidiary to sysco and sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan the amount borrowed was 1820 million and was repaid in full on july 4 2011 

  

 

commercial paper and revolving credit facility 

  

we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billion   

  

in december 2011 we terminated our previously existing revolving credit facility that supported the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs at the same time sysco and one of its subsidiaries sysco international ulc entered into a new 10 billion credit facility supporting the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs this facility provides for borrowings in both us and canadian dollars borrowings by sysco international ulc under the credit agreement are guaranteed by sysco and borrowings by sysco and sysco international ulc under the credit agreement and guaranteed by all the whollyowned subsidiaries of sysco that are guarantors of the company’s senior notes and debentures the facility expires on december 29 2016 but is subject to extension 

  

there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of june 30  2012   or augus t 15 2012  during fiscal 2012  2011 and 2010  aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to  5631 million zero to  3303 million and zero to  18 million respectively during fiscal 2012  2011 and 2 010  our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 016  025  and 08 0  respectively 

  

fixed rate debt 

  

included in current maturities of longterm debt as june 30 2012 are the 42 senior notes totaling 2500 million which mature in february 2013 it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through cash on hand cash flow from operations issuances of commercial paper senior notes or a combination thereof 

  

in september 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2000 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 to floating rate debt in october 2009   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2500 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 to floating rate debt both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

  

in february 2012  we filed with the sec an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock preferred stock debt securities and guarantees of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 

  

in june 2012 we repaid the 61 senior notes totaling 2000 million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

  

in may 2012 we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of 2000 million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the then forecasted june 2012 debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate in june 2012 in conjunction with the issuance of the 4500 million senior notes maturing in fiscal 2022 we settled the treasury lock locking in the effective yields on the related debt upon settlement we received cash of 07 million which represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of settlement this amount is being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the 10year term of the debt and the unamortized balance is reflected as a gain net of tax accumulated other comprehensive loss 

  

in june 2012  we issued 055  senior notes totaling  3000 million due june 12 2015 the 2015 notes and 26  senior notes totaling  4500 million due june 12 2022 the 2022 notes under its february 2012 shelf registration the 2015 and 2022 notes which were priced at 99319  and 98722  of par respectively are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions refinancing of debt working capital share repurchases and capital expenditures 

  

total debt 

  

total debt as of june 30 2012 was  30 billion of which approximately 84  was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 47  and an average life of 13 years and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 23  and an average life of one year certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders including provisions to maintain the company’s longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level we are currently in compliance wi th all debt covenants 

  

 

other 

  

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements in addition in connection with our audits in certain tax jurisdictions we have posted of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process as of june 30 2012 and july 2 2011 letters of credit outstanding were  298 million and  230 million respectively 

  

other considerations  multiemployer pension plans 

  

as discussed in note 14 “ multiemployer employee benefit plans ” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

  

under certain circumstances including our voluntary withdrawal or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from certain underfunded plans we would be required to make payments to the plans for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities we believe that one of the abovementioned events is reasonably possible with certain plans in which we participate and estimate our share of withdrawal liability for these plans could have been as much as  1000 million as of june 30 2012 and august 15 2012 this estimate excludes plans for which we have recorded withdrawal liabilities or where the likelihood of the abovementioned events is deemed remote due to the lack of current information we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate 

  

required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition pensionrelated legislation in the united states requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table sets forth as of june 30 2012  certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

  



  

  

1 the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement ages and payout periods 

  

2 includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fisca l 2022 based on actuarial assumptions 

  

 

3 represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements 

  

4   unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions as of june 30 2012  we had a liability of  522 million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and  279 million for related interest that could result in cash payment we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of noncurrent payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time accordingly the related noncurrent balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 

  

5 includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june 30 2012  assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates the impact of our outstanding fixedtofloating interest rate swaps on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june 30 2012  

  

6 provides the estimated minimum contribution to the retirement plan through fiscal 2022 to meet erisa minimum funding requirements under the assumption that we only make minimum funding requirement contributions each year based on actuarial assumptions 

  

7 for purposes of this table purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business for which all significant terms have been confirmed including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten  year period ending in fiscal 2015 see discussion under note 20 “commitments and contingencies” to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 

  

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 30 2012 included  661 million this amount is not included in the table above  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries in addition in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

  

selfinsurance program 

  

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

  

 

companysponsored pension plans 

  

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

  

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 201 2 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the july 2  2011 measurement date decreased 21 basis points to 594  the discount rate for determining fiscal 2012 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the july 2  2011 measurement date decreased 42 basis points to 593  the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 201 2 by an estimated  143 million the discount rate for determining fiscal 2013 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 30 2012 measurement date decreased 113 basis points to 481  the discount rate for determining fiscal 2013 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 30 2012 measurement date decreased 104 basis points to 489  the combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2013 by an estimated  841 million a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2013 would decrease sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by  419 million while a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rates would increase pensio n cost by  506 million the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 100 basis point decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates therefore a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

  

we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels we used a plan specific agerelated set of rates for the retirement plan which are equivalent to a single rate of 530 as of june 30 2012 and july 2 2011 for determining the benefit obligations as of june 30 2012 and july 2 2011 the serp calculations use an agegraded salary growth assumption 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 775 for fiscal 2012 a nd 800 for fiscal 2011 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 70 42 16 and 02 over th e 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2011  respectively in addition in eight of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

  

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 775  for fiscal 2013  a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2013 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2013 by approximately  221 million 

  

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 30 2012 was a charge net of tax of  8239 million the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 2  201 1 was a charge net of tax of  5011 million 

  

changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods  the impact of plan amendments and the timing and amount of contributions de creased net companysponsored pension costs by  273 million in fiscal 2012  at the end of fiscal 2012 sysco decided to freez e future benefit accruals under the retirement plan   as of december 31 2012 for all usbased salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective january 1 2013 these employees will be eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced defined contribution plan changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the plan freeze  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods the impact of plan amendments and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to decrease net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2013 by approximately 26 5 million absent the retirement plan freeze discussed above net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2013 would have increased 1069 million instead of decreasing 265 million 

  

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of  1624 million and  1617 million in fiscal years 2012 and 2011  respectively the 1400 million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal 2012 exceeded the minimum required contribution for the calendar 2011 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements the 1400 million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal 2011 was voluntary as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar 2010 plan year there 

 

are no required contributions to the retirement plan to meet erisa minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2013 the estimated fiscal 201 3 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately  23   million  

  

income taxes 

  

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

  

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

  

vendor consideration 

  

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in some instances vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold our inventory turnover is usually less than one month therefore amounts deferred against inventory do not require longterm estimation in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized historically adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

  

in addition annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our nine operating segments as described in note 2 1  “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8  the components within each of our nine operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into nine reporting units  

  

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our nine operating segments we use a 60 weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and 40 for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units   

  

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2011 and 2010 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the 

 

estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2012 analysis our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis however we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for the following reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts first our european broadline company would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 45 lower second our specialty produce operations would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 38 lower at june 30 2012  these two reporting units had goodwill aggregating  3169 million for the remainder of our reporting units which at june 30 2012 had goodwill aggregating  13 billion we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 50  

  

certain reporting units european broadline specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products  imported specialty products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the united states broadline canadian broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the united states broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the united states broadline reporting units as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

  

sharebased compensation 

  

we provide compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plan and various nonemployee director plans 

  

as of june 30 2012  there was  637 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 236 years 

  

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

  

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 

  

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

  

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

  

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

  

o ur sharebased awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period w e will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

  

in addition certain of our   sharebased   awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement in these cases we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 

  

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

  

 

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business sales and expense trends including expectations regarding payrelated expense defined contribution plan costs and pension costs anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expectations regarding share repurchases dividend payments expected trends in fuel pricing usage costs and surcharges our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable expected implementation costs and benefits of the erp system estimated expenses and capital expenditures related to our business transformation project in fiscal 2013 beliefs regarding future erp conversions at our operating companies expectations regarding our other business transformation initiatives including cost transformation and   product cost reduction initiatives beliefs regarding the timeline for the realization of benefits from each of our initiatives within our business transformation project our plan to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business the impact of ongoing legal proceedings the loss of sygma’s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of financing for them continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives anticipated companysponsored pension plan liabilities our expectations regarding cash flow from operations our intentions regarding the repayment of debt the impact of initiatives to improve working capital the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses expectations regarding the cost of hardware and hardware hosting services the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

  

these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item 1a in the annual report on form 10k and elsewhere in addition the success of sysco’s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control including actions by our competitors andor customers we have experienced delays in the implementation of our business transformation project and the expected costs of our business transformation project may be greater or less than currently expected as we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems scheduling delays cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process as implementation of the erp system and other initiatives within the business transformation project begins there may be changes in design or timing that impact nearterm expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required which could also impact project expense and timing our business transformation project initiatives related to erp implementation cost transformation and produce cost reduction may not provide the expected benefits or cost savings in a timely fashion if at all if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease defined contribution plan costs are impacted by the number of employees participating in the plan and the level of contributions made by each employee companysponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to the company’s other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally legal proceedings are impacted by events circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated stock repurchases at historical levels or other unexpected cash requirements plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on management’s assessment of the overall needs of the company the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect and laws and regulations as well as methods of enforcement are subject to change 

  

  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

  

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

  

fiscal 2012 

  

as of june 30 2012  we had no commercial paper outstanding total debt as of june 30 2012 was  30 billion of which approximately 84  was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

  

in may 2012 we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of 2000 million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the june 2012 forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate in june 2012 in conjunction with the issuance of the 4500 million senior notes maturing in fiscal 2022 we settled the treasury lock locking in the effective yields on the related debt 

  

in fiscal 2010 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted 250 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 the fiscal 2013 swap and 200 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 the fiscal 2014 swap to floating rate debt both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

  

as of june 30 2012  the fiscal 2013 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of 25 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 42 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly as of june 30 2012 the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of  62 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly 

  

the following tables present our interest rate position as of june 30 2012 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 



  

  





 



  

rate a – threemonth libor 

  

fiscal 20 11 

  

as of july 2 2011 we had no commercial paper outstanding total debt as of july 2 2011 was 27 billion of which approximately 75 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

  

as of july 2 2011 the fiscal 2013 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 61 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 42 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly as of july 2 2011 the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 74 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact   on sales when compared to fiscal 201 1 and positively impacted sales by 05  in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share w as not material in fi scal 2012 and fiscal 2011  a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2012 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2012 sales by 12  and woul d not have materially impa cted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share  we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

  

fuel price risk 

  

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 07  0 6  and 06  of sales respectively fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges incurred by s ysco increased by   approximately  398 million   in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 and by  330   million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 

  

we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 30 2012  we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately  96 million throu gh april 2013 subsequent to june 30 2012 we entered into forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately  20 million for may and june 2012 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 35  to 45  of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices higher than the current market price for diesel 

  

assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2013  fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are not expected to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal 2012  our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2013 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates a 10  unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price use d in our estimates above would result in a potential increase to  10 million to  20 million  

  

investment risk 

  

our companysponsored qualified pension   p lan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability  f luctuations in asset values can caus e the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend  which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets specifically decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments h e ld by our companysponsored retirement plan at the plan’s fiscal year end december 31 2011  wo uld not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2013 however this unfavorable change would increa se our pension expense for fiscal 201 3 by  330 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 30 2012 by  1377 million

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

 

 

 

 

  

our operating companies distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders competitive pricing close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through our approximately 13500 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended july 2 2011 

 

based upon available information we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

sources of supply 

 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

 

we administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in these consolidated programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through these consolidated programs we also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers this includes the construction and operation of regional distribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region currently we have two rdcs in operation in virginia and florida and will begin construction on a third rdc in fiscal 2012 in indiana 

 

working capital practices 

 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources” at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

 

corporate headquarters and shared services center 

 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance treasury legal cash management information technology employee benefits engineering real estate and construction risk management and insurance sales and marketing payroll human resources training and development strategy and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

 

we are in the early stages of implementing a shared services center that will perform support services for employees suppliers and customers payroll administration human resources customer and vendor contract administration financial services such as vendor payments invoicing cash application certain credit services accounting and sales and use tax administration procurement and maintenance support and sales support for our operating companies 

 

capital improvements 

 

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to modernize expand and construct new distribution facilities during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 6364 million 5946 million and 4646 million respectively were invested in technology facilities delivery fleet and other capital asset enhancements we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 should be in the range of 750 million to 800 million during the three years ended july 2 2011 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2012 capital expenditures from the same sources 

 

we are undertaking a multiyear business transformation project pursuant to which we are developing and implementing an integrated software system to support a majority of our businesses and further streamline our operations these systems are commonly referred to as enterprise resource planning erp systems approximately 100 million to 120 million of the fiscal 2012 estimated capital expenditures are related to the business transformation project 

 

employees 

 

as of july 2 2011 we had approximately 46000 fulltime employees approximately 17 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 25 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which have expired or will expire during fiscal 2012 and are subject to renegotiation since july 2 2011 two contracts covering 85 of such employees have been renegotiated we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

 

competition 

 

industry sources estimate that there are more than 15000 companies engaged in foodservice distribution in the united states our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors a few organizations compete with us on a national basis we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices an additional competitive factor for our larger chain restaurant customers is the ability to provide a national distribution network we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about 17 of this approximately 220 billion annual market we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the united states and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2011 while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our more than 8000 marketing associates our diversified product base which includes a differentiated group of high quality sysco brand products the diversity in the types of customers we serve our economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time and provides a national distribution network for larger chain restaurant customers we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in business improvements we are the only publiclytraded distributor in the foodawayfromhome industry in the united states while our public company status provides us with some advantages including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

government regulation 

 

as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda as well as the canadian food and drugs act and the regulations thereunder 

 

the fda regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

 

in canada the canadian food inspection agency administers and enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards established by health canada under the canadian food and drugs act and under other related federal legislation including the canada agricultural products act the meat inspection act the fish inspection act and the consumer packaging and labeling act as it relates to food these laws regulate the processing storing grading packaging marking transporting and inspection of certain sysco product lines as well as the packaging labeling sale importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products 

 

we and our products are also subject to state provincial and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state provincial and local health agencies of state provincial and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor together with similar occupational health and safety laws in each canadian province these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

 

we are also subject to regulation by numerous us and canadian federal state provincial and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor and each canadian provincial ministry of labour which set employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation and the canadian transportation agency which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

 

most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks although we are subject to other us and canadian federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials these provisions do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

 

compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

 

general 

 

we have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance including the sysco ® trademark and our privatelybranded product trademarks that include the sysco ® trademark these trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry approximately half of our privatelybranded sales are from products labeled with our sysco ® trademark without any other trademark we believe the loss of the sysco ® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our us trademarks are effective for a ten year period and the company generally renews its trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use the company does not have any material patents or licenses 

 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

 

as of july 2 2011 we operated 177 distribution facilities throughout the united states canada and ireland

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

periods of difficult economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets affect consumer confidence which can adversely impact our business 

 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins and the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions difficult economic conditions such as the slow economic recovery experienced in fiscal 2011 which included food and fuel cost inflation experienced by the consumer and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending this can lead to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases these conditions in turn can negatively impacted our sales the development of worsening economic conditions in the future or permanent changes in consumer dining habits as a result of such conditions would likely negatively impact our operating results 

 

periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and profitability 

 

volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability in addition product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer spending decisions which could adversely impact our sales conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant our estimate for the inflation in sysco’s cost of goods was 46 in fiscal 2011 compared to deflation of 15 in fiscal 2010 and inflation of 47 in fiscal 2009 

 

our business transformation project could experience implementation problems scheduling delays or cost overages and may not prove to be cost effective or result in the benefits we anticipate negatively impacting our business results of operations and liquidity 

 

in fiscal 2009 we commenced the design of an enterprisewide project to implement an integrated software system commonly referred to as an enterprise resource planning erp system to support a majority of our business processes and further streamline our operations we have substantially completed the design and build phases of our business transformation project and we are testing the underlying erp system and processes through a pilot implementation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 our pilot operating company implemented the project and our shared services center became active in its support role erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multiyear timeframe as is the case in most erp implementations we expect that the implementation of our erp system will require transformation of business and financial processes in order to realize the full benefits of the project although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the longterm the costs will exceed the benefits during the testing and deployment stages of implementation including fiscal 2012 the expected costs of the project in fiscal 2012 may be greater or less than currently expected because as we continue implementation of the project we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget including incurring expenses at an earlier or later time than currently anticipated in fiscal 2011 we took more time to test the underlying erp system and processes we are also taking additional time in fiscal 2012 to improve the underlying systems prior to larger scale deployment these actions have caused a delay in the project of approximately six to twelve months and until we reach the point where the underlying system functions as intended our deployment timeline is still being determined our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems scheduling delays cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process in addition because the implementation is expected to involve a significant capital commitment our business results of operations and liquidity may also be adversely affected if the erp system and the associated process changes do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits that we anticipate 

 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs 

 

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past there is no guarantee that we can do so again if another period of high fuel costs occurs if fuel costs increase again in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the thencurrent market price for diesel if fuel prices decrease significantly these forward purchases may prove ineffective and result in us paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel 

 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs 

 

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third party suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us although our purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are 

also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop conditions product recalls water shortages transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

 

if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations we could become subject to lawsuits investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 

 

we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal state international national provincial and local levels in many areas of our business such as food safety and sanitation minimum wage overtime wage payment wage and hour and employment discrimination immigration human health and safety including regulations of the fda usda us occupational safety and health administration federal motor carrier safety data privacy environmental protection the import and export of goods and customs regulations the false claims act the foreign corrupt practices act and the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs from time to time both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts or otherwise we also receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or encounter disagreements with respect to our contracts subject to governmental regulations including those referred to above we may be subject to investigations criminal sanctions or civil remedies including fines injunctions prohibitions on exporting seizures or debarments from contracting with the government the cost of compliance or the consequences of noncompliance including debarments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings 

 

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products anything that damages that reputation or the public’s confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of our products could quickly affect our revenues and profits reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact the public’s confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns such as flu epidemics or other pandemics even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically 

 

competition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers 

 

the foodservice industry is highly competitive and numerous regional and local competitors exist additionally new competition could arise from nontraditional sources or consolidation among competitors new competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases or may require increased discounting such competition may result in margin erosion andor make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers 

 

increased competition within the industry and general economic conditions have served to further increase pressure on the industry’s profit margins and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors our market share sales and profitability through increased expenditures or decreased prices could be adversely impacted 

 

product liability claims could materially impact our business 

 

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

expanding into international markets and complimentary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complimentary lines of business may not be successful 

 

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations 

 

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complimentary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complimentary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complimentary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively 

 

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

 

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact 

 

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

 

our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and liquidity position 

 

as of july 2 2011 we had approximately 27 billion of total indebtedness we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billion a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs in the amount of 10 billion set to expire on november 4 2012 and certain uncommitted bank lines of credit providing for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to 950 million our indebtedness may increase from time to time for various reasons including fluctuations in operating results working capital needs capital expenditures and potential acquisitions or joint ventures prior to maturity of our revolving credit facility we plan to renew or extend this credit facility the amount of credit capacity we are able to obtain if not sufficient for our needs and the ultimate cost of such credit could have a negative impact on our liquidity cost of capital and financial results in addition to the extent that we decrease the amount of capacity under our revolver when it is renewed there is a risk that such liquidity levels may not be adequate in the future to the extent that our access to capital markets is restricted 

 

technology dependence could have a material negative impact on our business 

 

our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs furthermore process changes may be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing delivery and payroll systems to support operations as we implement the erp system while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits 

 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans 

 

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 10 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2011 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 328 million 

we do not directly manage these multiemployer plans which are generally managed by boards of trustees half of whom are appointed by the unions and the other half by other contributing employers to the plan based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding as a result we expect our required contributions to these plans to increase in the future 

 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the information currently available from plan administrators which has valuation dates ranging from january 31 2009 to december 31 2009 sysco estimates its share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans in which it participates could have been as much as 2000 million as of july 2 2011 based on a voluntary withdrawal this estimate excludes plans for which sysco has recorded withdrawal liabilities the majority of the plans we participate in have a valuation date of calendar yearend as such the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results from plans for which the valuation date was december 31 2009 therefore our estimated liability reflects the effects of the fair value of the plans’ assets and projected benefit obligations as of that date due to the lack of current information we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate in addition if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements the internal revenue service irs may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5 on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund as of july 2 2011 sysco had approximately 424 million in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal has already occurred if any of these plans were to undergo a mass withdrawal as defined by the pension benefit guaranty corporation within a two year time frame from the point of our withdrawal we could have additional liability requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 

 

our funding of our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase and our earnings may decrease should financial markets experience future declines 

 

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability our expense is also impacted by these items fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet at fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our discount rate at fiscal yearend specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our contributions and pension expense may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations 

 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages 

 

as of july 2 2011 approximately 7800 employees at 52 operating companies were members of 55 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2012 21 agreements covering approximately 2000 employees have expired or will expire since july 2 2011 two contracts covering 85 of the approximately 2000 employees have been renegotiated failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings 

 

our operations rely heavily on our employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

 

our authorized preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders 

 

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are primarily located throughout the united states canada and ireland and include broadline companies customcut meat operations specialty produce companies hotel supply operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 

 

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about 17 of this approximately 220 billion annual market according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 47 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states this share grew from about 37 in 1972 to nearly 50 in 1998 and did not change materially until 2009 when it declined to the current level of 47 

 

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately 08 in calendar year 2010 and 69 in calendar year 2009 real sales declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

 

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market historically we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 

 

highlights 

 

a slow economic recovery in the united states combined with rising product cost inflation and continued low levels of consumer confidence contributed to a challenging business environment in fiscal 2011 sales increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 however gross profit dollars grew at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increased faster than gross profit partially due to a significant charge of 361 million from a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan this resulted in a decline in operating income for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 comparisons between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are impacted by the presence of a 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30th this resulted in a 52week year ending july 2 2011 a 53week year ending july 3 2010 for fiscal 2010 and a 52week year ending june 27 2009 our results of operations discussion includes reconciliations of the actual results for fiscal 2010 to the adjusted results for fiscal 2010 based on a 52week fiscal year due to the impact of the 53week year in fiscal 2010 

 

the following table sets forth the change in certain components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over fiscal 2010 on both a 53week basis or gaap basis and an adjusted 52week basis

trends and strategy 

 

trends 

 

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income have contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market 

 

we have experienced higher levels of product cost inflation this fiscal year as compared to fiscal 2010 while we are generally able to pass on modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable to pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit operating income and earnings 

 

we have also experienced higher operating costs this fiscal year from increased payrelated expense due to increased sales and gross profit as well as higher pension and fuel costs we believe payrelated expense could continue to increase if sales and gross profit increase as a portion of these costs is variable in nature pension costs will decrease in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher returns on assets of sysco’s companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal 2011 fuel costs are expected to increase in fiscal 2012 as a result of anticipated higher fuel prices our business transformation project is a key part of our strategy to control costs and continue to grow our business we believe expenses related to the project will increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as we prepare to begin deployment of the project to our operating companies and increase our headcount in our shared services center 

 

strategy 

 

we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the us and canada while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value through adjacent and international businesses daytoday our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service with the aspiration of becoming each of our customers’ most valued business partner we have identified five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision

business transformation project 

 

in fiscal 2011 we substantially completed the design and build phases of our multiyear business transformation project and we are testing the underlying erp system and processes through a pilot implementation we took more time to test the underlying erp system and processes in fiscal 2011 than we originally anticipated our pilot operating company implemented the project and our shared services center became active in its support role in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we are also taking additional time in fiscal 2012 to improve the underlying systems prior to larger scale deployment these actions have caused a delay in the project of approximately six to twelve months and until we reach the point where the underlying system functions as intended our deployment timeline is still being determined although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the longterm the costs will exceed the benefits during the testing and deployment stages of implementation including fiscal 2012 

 

gross project expenses related to the business transformation project were 1020 million in fiscal 2011 or 011 per share 811 million in fiscal 2010 or 009 per share and 357 million in fiscal 2009 or 004 per share our cash outlay for fiscal 2011 was 2788 million of which approximately 196 million was capitalized provided the improvements needed in the underlying systems are obtained in the first half of fiscal 2012 we anticipate the software will be ready for its intended use in the second half of fiscal 2012 which will result in reduced capitalization as compared to fiscal 2011 and increased expense from both software amortization and deployment costs we will also incur increased costs from the ramp up of our shared services center continuing costs for additional phases of our business transformation project and information technology support costs some of these increased costs will be partially offset by benefits obtained from the project primarily in reduced headcount however the costs will not exceed the benefits in fiscal 2012 we expect our gross project expenses related to the business transformation project for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 280 million to 300 million and capital expenditures to be approximately 100 million to 120 million

the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

 

 

 

 

  

impact of 53week fiscal year in fiscal 2010 

 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30th this resulted in a 52week year ending july 2 2011 a 53week year ending july 3 2010 for fiscal 2010 and a 52week year june 27 2009 for 2009 because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2011 our results of operations for fiscal 2010 are not directly comparable to the current or prior year management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2010 results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis as a result the results of operations discussion for fiscal 2010 presented below in certain instances discusses operating items that have been adjusted by onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter except as otherwise noted with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share failure to make these adjustments would cause the yearoveryear changes in certain metrics such as sales operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated whereas in certain cases a metric may actually have increased rather than declined or declined rather than increased on a more comparable yearoveryear basis our results of operations discussion includes reconciliations of the actual results for fiscal 2010 to the adjusted results for fiscal 2010 based on a 52week fiscal year 

 

sales 

 

sales for fiscal 2011 were 56 higher in fiscal 2011 than fiscal 2010 after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 the increase in sales in fiscal 2011 would have been 77 sales for fiscal 2010 were 11 higher than fiscal 2009 after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 fiscal 2010 would have had a sales decrease of 09 set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growthdecline for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year in fiscal 2010” above 

 

 

 

sales for fiscal 2011 excluding the negative impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices along with improving case volumes estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were approximately 46 during fiscal 2011 sales from acquisitions in the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 07 for fiscal 2011 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 05 compared to fiscal 2010 

 

sales for fiscal 2010 in addition to the positive impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 were increased by improving case volumes the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 09 compared to fiscal 2009 sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 05 for fiscal 2010 product cost deflation and the resulting decrease in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal 2010 estimated changes in product costs an internal measure of deflation or inflation were estimated as deflation of 15 during fiscal 2010 a change in customer sales mix as compared to fiscal 2009 also negatively impacted fiscal 2010 sales case volumes increased at a greater rate within our contract based customer group which generally receives lower pricing for higher volume 

operating income 

 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 

 

operating income decreased 22 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 to 19 billion and as a percentage of sales declined to 49 of sales after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 would have been 01 this adjusted decrease was primarily driven by gross profit dollars growing at a slower rate than sales and operating expenses increasing faster than gross profit partially due to a significant charge of 361 million from a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan gross profit dollars increased 30 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and operating expenses increased 50 in fiscal 2011 

 

operating income increased 55 in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 to 20 billion and as a percentage of sales increased to 53 of sales after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 the increase in operating income in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 would have been 33 this adjusted increase in operating income was primarily driven by a decrease in operating expenses gross profit dollars increased 10 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 while operating expenses decreased 06 in fiscal 2010 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of actual operating income to adjusted operating income for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year in fiscal 2010” above 

 

 

 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased sales partially offset by the negative comparison of the additional week included in fiscal 2010 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 1862 in fiscal 2011 a decline of 47 basis points from the gross profit as a percentage of sales of 1908 in fiscal 2010 this decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of the following factors described in the paragraphs below 

 

first sysco’s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of 46 during fiscal 2011 based on our product sales mix for fiscal 2011 we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy meat and seafood product categories in the range of 10 to 12 our largest selling product category canned and dry experienced inflation of 4 while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable to pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels prolonged periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit and earnings 

 

second ongoing strategic pricing initiatives in fiscal 2011 lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in shortterm gross profit declines as a percentage of sales but we believe will result in longterm gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented we believe the longterm benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 

 

third gross profit dollars for fiscal 2011 increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 260 million higher in fiscal 2011 than in the comparable prior year period due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal 2011 and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter assuming that fuel prices do not greatly vary from recent levels experienced in the second half of fiscal 2011 we expect fuel surcharges to largely offset our increased fuel costs expected in fiscal 2012 

 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the additional week included in fiscal 2010 in addition gross profit reflected product cost deflation in fiscal 2010 as compared to product cost inflation in fiscal 2009 we may be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of product cost deflation because a significant portion of our sales are at prices based on the cost of products sold plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant gross profit dollars for fiscal 2010 were also impacted by lower fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 496 million lower in fiscal 2010 than fiscal 2009 

 

operating expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 50 primarily due to higher payrelated expense an increase in net companysponsored pension costs provisions for withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and higher fuel costs as compared to the prior year period the 

impact of these operating expense increases was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 998 million resulting from the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2011 

 

operating expenses for fiscal 2010 were lower than in fiscal 2009 primarily due to reduced fuel costs and a favorable comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in both periods partially offsetting these operating expense declines were increases in payrelated expenses net companysponsored pension costs and approximately 998 million of expense associated with the additional week included in fiscal 2010 

 

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project increased by 628 million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased sales and gross profit which resulted in increased delivery personnel costs and sales compensation portions of our payrelated expense are variable in nature and are expected to increase when sales and gross profit increase payrelated expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase partially offsetting these increases were lower provisions for current management incentive bonuses of 121 million 

 

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project increased by 439 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 the fiscal 2010 increase was primarily due to increased provisions for management incentive accruals and cost associated with the additional week included in fiscal 2010 partially offsetting these increases were lower payrelated expenses due to reduced headcount the criteria for paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to overall company performance in fiscal 2010 the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses was met therefore the provision for current management incentive bonuses was higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 when the company assessed it did not meet the criteria for paying certain annual bonuses headcount declines occurred in fiscal 2010 due to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions commensurate with lower sales headcount was 22 lower at the end of fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

 

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2011 were 603 million higher than in fiscal 2010 the increase in fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense at the end of fiscal 2010 partially offset by reduced amortization of our net actuarial loss resulting from actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of sysco’s retirement plan during fiscal 2010 net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2012 have been determined as of the fiscal 2011 yearend measurement date and will decrease by approximately 27 million from fiscal 2011 due primarily to higher returns on assets of sysco’s retirement plan during fiscal 2011 

 

net companysponsored pension costs were 374 million higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 the increase in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to lower returns on assets of sysco’s companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal 2009 partially offset by an increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal 2010 

 

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans we recorded provisions related to multiemployer pension plans of 415 million in fiscal 2011 29 million in fiscal 2010 and 96 million in fiscal 2009 see additional discussion of multiemployer pension plans at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations multiemployer pension plans” 

 

sysco’s fuel costs increased by 330 million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices our fuel costs decreased by 718 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreased contracted diesel prices sysco’s costs per gallon increased 143 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 as compared to a decrease of 261 in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 sysco’s activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices 

 

our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods in fiscal 2011 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 164 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2010 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 15 million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes for a portion of the fiscal year in fiscal 2009 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 677 million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes 

 

as of july 2 2011 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 86 million through june 2012 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 30 to 35 of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices lower than the current market price for diesel for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2012 and near the current market price for diesel for the remainder of the fiscal year subsequent to july 2 2011 we entered into forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 17 million for july and august 2012 assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2012 fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 35 million to 45 million as compared to fiscal 2011 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2012 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management based on our current projections we anticipate that the increase in fuel surcharges will offset the majority of our projected fuel cost increase in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 

gross project expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated expense increased by 208 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 and by 416 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 the increase in fiscal 2011 resulted from increased project spend including the initial stages of ramping up of our shared services center and a provision for severance resulting from the implementation of an involuntary severance plan the increase in fiscal 2010 resulted from only six months of activity being included in fiscal 2009 as the business transformation project began in january 2009 provided the improvements needed in the underlying systems are obtained in the first half of fiscal 2012 we anticipate the software will be ready for its intended use in the second half of fiscal 2012 which will result in increased expense from both software amortization and deployment costs we will also incur increased costs from the ramp up of our shared services center continuing costs for additional phases of our business transformation project and information technology support costs we believe the increase in gross project expenses including all payrelated expenses related to the business transformation project in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 will be approximately 175 million to 195 million 

 

we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments which through fiscal 2011 included publicly traded securities as a result the cash surrender values of these policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such securities the changes in the financial markets resulted in gains for these policies of 282 million in fiscal 2011 compared to gains for these policies of 216 million in fiscal 2010 and losses of 438 million in fiscal 2009 near the end of fiscal 2011 we reallocated all of our policies into lowrisk fixedincome securities and therefore we no longer expect significant volatility in operating income net earnings and earnings per share in future periods related to these policies 

 

the provision for losses on receivables included within operating expenses decreased by 397 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 the decrease in our provision for losses on receivables in fiscal 2010 reflects fewer customer accounts exceeding our threshold for writeoff in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 customer accounts written off net of recoveries were 378 million or 010 of sales 343 million or 010 of sales and 719 million or 020 of sales for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our provision for losses on receivables will fluctuate with general market conditions as well as the circumstances of our customers 

 

net earnings 

 

net earnings for fiscal 2011 decreased 24 over the comparable prior year period after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 the decrease would have been 03 this adjusted decrease was primarily due to the factors discussed above and an increase in the effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 3696 compared to an effective tax rate of 3620 for fiscal 2010 the difference between the tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from the onetime reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies related to our settlement with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

net earnings increased 117 in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 the increase would have been 95 this adjusted increase was primarily due to a reduction in the effective income tax rate as well as the factors discussed above the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 3620 compared to an effective tax rate of 4037 for fiscal 2009 the difference between the tax rates for the two periods resulted largely from the onetime reversal of interest accruals for tax contingencies related to our settlement with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of actual net earnings to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year in fiscal 2010” above 

 

 

 

the effective tax rate of 3696 for fiscal 2011 was favorably impacted primarily by two items first we recorded a tax benefit of approximately 170 million for the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards second we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values the gain of 282 million recorded in fiscal 2011 was primarily nontaxable for income tax purposes and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by 111 million partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the recording of 93 million in tax and interest related to various federal foreign and state uncertain tax positions 

 

the effective tax rate of 3620 for fiscal 2010 was favorably impacted primarily by two items first we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately 290 million resulting from the onetime reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement with the irs see “liquidity and capital resources other considerations bscc cooperative structure” for additional discussion second the gain of 216 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal 2010 was nontaxable for income tax purposes and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by 83 million 

 

the effective tax rate of 4037 for fiscal 2009 was unfavorably impacted primarily by two factors first we recorded tax adjustments related to federal and state uncertain tax positions of 310 million second the loss of 438 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal 2009 was nondeductible for income tax purposes and had the impact of increasing income tax expense for 

the period by 168 million the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances of 78 million previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets 

 

earnings per share 

 

basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 15 in fiscal 2011 from the prior year after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 earnings per share increased 05 this adjusted increase was primarily the result of factors discussed above as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in both average and diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases which occurred during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2011 

 

basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 124 in fiscal 2010 from the prior year after adjusting for the estimated impact of the 53 rd week in fiscal 2010 this increase would have been 102 this adjusted increase was primarily the result of factors discussed above as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and an increase in the number of antidilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of actual diluted earnings per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year in fiscal 2010” above 

 

 

 

basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 were favorably impacted by two items first we recognized a favorable impact of 005 per share due to the gains recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values second a favorable impact of 002 per share was recognized related to the recognition of deferred tax assets from the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards these favorable impacts were partially offset by 004 per share relating to the charge recorded upon withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in the third quarter 

 

basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2010 were favorably impacted by 005 per share due to the onetime reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement of an outstanding tax matter with the irs and 004 per share due to gains recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 

 

segment results 

 

we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the company’s customcut meat operations were reorganized to function as part of the united states broadline segment as a result the results of the customcut meat operations are included in the broadline reportable segment in the segment discussion below previously these operations were an independent segment and were presented with the “other” financial information relating to nonreportable segments segment reporting for the comparable prior year periods has been revised to conform to the new classification of the customcut meat operations as part of the broadline reportable segment 

 

the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 

 

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results which include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in gross profits expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

 

included in corporate expenses among other items are

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 

 

  

the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment and intersegment sales expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales including intersegment sales and operating income respectively for purposes of this statistical table operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of 3371 million in fiscal 2011 2696 million in fiscal 2010 and 2193 million in fiscal 2009 that are not charged to our segments this information should be read in conjunction with note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 

broadline segment 

 

the broadline reportable segment consists of the aggregated results of the united states canadian and european broadline segments as well as the customcut meat operations broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to customers broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2011 the broadline operating results represented approximately 81 of sysco’s overall sales and 93 of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

 

there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment’s earnings 

 

sales 

 

sales for fiscal 2011 were 51 greater than fiscal 2010 negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 was the additional week in fiscal 2010 product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices combined with case volume improvement contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal 2011 changes in product costs an internal measure of inflation or deflation were estimated as inflation of 49 in fiscal 2011 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 08 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2011 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 06 compared to fiscal 2010 

 

sales for fiscal 2010 were 14 greater than fiscal 2009 case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 10 compared to fiscal 2009 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 06 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2010 changes in product costs were estimated as deflation of 15 in fiscal 2010 this product cost deflation which led to decreases in selling prices and a change in customer sales mix partially offset case volume improvement in fiscal 2010 the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2010 

operating income 

 

operating income increased by 01 in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 as gross profit dollars increased slightly above the rate that operating expenses increased however it is important to note that operating expenses included a significant charge of 361 million from a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan additionally negatively affecting the operating income comparison of fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 was the additional week in fiscal 2010 

 

gross profit dollars increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased sales however gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales this slower growth in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of two factors based on broadline’s product sales mix for fiscal 2011 it was most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the dairy meat and seafood product categories in the range of 10 to 12 broadline’s largest selling product category canned and dry experienced inflation of 4 while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers we were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross profit percentage in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers’ business and therefore our business while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at these levels prolonged periods of high inflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfromhome market and may negatively impact the broadline segment’s sales gross profit and earnings second ongoing strategic pricing initiatives largely lowered our prices to our customers in certain product categories in order to increase sales volumes these initiatives are being phased in over time and resulted in shortterm gross profit declines as a percentage of sales but we believe will result in longterm gross profit dollar growth due to higher sales volumes and increased market share we have experienced meaningful year over year volume growth with those items included in the early phases of these programs in the geographies where this program has been implemented we believe the longterm benefits of these strategic initiatives will result in profitable market share growth 

 

in addition gross profit dollars for fiscal 2011 increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 194 million higher in fiscal 2011 than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for a small portion of the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods assuming that fuel prices do not greatly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2012 we expect fuel surcharges to largely offset our increased fuel costs expected in fiscal 2012 

 

the expense increases in fiscal 2011 were driven largely by provisions for withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan and an increase in payrelated expenses in fiscal 2011 we recorded provisions of 415 million for withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer pension plans from which union members elected to withdraw the increase in payrelated expenses related to the sales and gross profit increase including both delivery personnel costs and sales portions of our payrelated expense are variable in nature and are expected to increase when sales and gross profit increase payrelated expenses from acquired companies and changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars also contributed to the increase 

 

fuel costs were 220 million higher in fiscal 2011 than the prior year assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2012 fuel costs for fiscal 2012 not including any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 25 million to 35 million as compared to fiscal 2011 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2012 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 

 

operating income increased by 59 in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily due to effective management of operations in the current economic environment by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods operating expenses decreased 12 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the additional week in fiscal 2010 contributed to the gross profit increase partially offset by a decrease of approximately 374 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to less usage of these surcharges in fiscal 2010 expense performance for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to reduced fuel cost and lower provision for losses on receivables and operating efficiencies such as reduced pay — related expense due to reduced headcount fuel costs were 518 million lower in fiscal 2010 than in the prior year partially offsetting these expense declines were increases in expenses related to the additional week in fiscal 2010 

 

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans we recorded provisions related to multiemployer pension plans of 415 million in fiscal 2011 29 million in fiscal 2010 and 96 million in fiscal 2009 

 

sygma segment 

 

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

sales 

 

sales were 92 greater in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 negatively affecting the sales comparison of fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 was the additional week in fiscal 2010 the increase in sales was primarily due to case volume improvement largely attributable to new customers and to a lesser extent from an increase in volume from certain existing customers 

 

sales were 11 greater in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 the additional week contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2010 case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 this case growth was largely attributable to new customers added largely in the latter part of the fiscal year and the additional week in fiscal 2010 partially offsetting these case volume improvements was a decline in volume from existing customers due to the weak economic environment which applied continued pressure to consumer discretionary spending and negatively impacted overall restaurant traffic counts product cost deflation which led to decreases in selling prices also impacted fiscal 2010 sales growth 

 

one chain restaurant customer the wendy’s company accounted for approximately 31 of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended july 2 2011 sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

 

operating income 

 

operating income increased 129 million in 2011 over the prior year due to increased sales and improved productivity gross profit dollars increased 95 while operating expenses increased 73 in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal 2011 were increased sales and an increase of approximately 66 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2011 from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal 2011 the increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2011 was largely driven by increased delivery and warehouse personnel payroll costs resulting from increased sales as well as increased fuel cost productivity improvements occurred within our warehouse and delivery functions in fiscal 2011 and expense reductions occurred within our administrative functions in fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior year fuel costs in fiscal 2011 were 129 million greater than the prior year assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2012 we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment to increase as compared to fiscal 2011 

 

operating income increased by 171 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 gross profit dollars increased 07 while operating expenses decreased 37 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the additional week in fiscal 2010 contributed to the gross profit increase partially offset by a decrease of approximately 114 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to lower fuel prices in fiscal 2010 expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions also contributing to the decrease in operating expenses was a decrease of 101 million in fuel costs in fiscal 2010 from the prior year due to lower fuel prices 

 

other segment 

 

“other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 

 

on an aggregate basis our “other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in fiscal 2011 in the aggregate the “other” segment represented approximately 56 of sysco’s overall sales and 41 of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

 

operating income increased 96 for fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 the operating income comparison was negatively affected by the additional week in fiscal 2010 the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in the specialty produce segment and favorable expense management in the specialty produce and lodging industry products segments 

 

operating income increased 297 for fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in our specialty produce segment and increased operating income in all segments due to favorable expense management the additional week in fiscal 2010 also contributed to the increase in operating income 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sysco’s strategic objectives require continuing investment and our financial resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to working capital requirements investments in facilities systems fleet other equipment and technology acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy and cash dividends any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments or applied toward the cost of the share repurchase program as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate 

business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

 

our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions primarily due to their impact on our cash flows from operations weak economic conditions and low levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income can lower our sales growth and potentially our cash flows from operations while these factors were present in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 they had only a modest impact on our cash flows from operations in these periods due in large part to effective working capital management we do not believe current economic conditions will significantly impact our cash flows from operations in fiscal 2012 as we can respond to reduced consumer demand if it were to occur by lowering our working capital requirements additionally approximately onethird of our customers are not impacted by general economic conditions to the same extent as restaurants and other food retailers these customers include hospitals nursing homes schools and colleges product cost inflation can potentially lower our gross profit and cash flow from operations if we are unable to pass through all of the increased product costs with the same gross profit percentage to our customers this occurred in fiscal 2011 as we were able to pass some but not all of our product cost increases on to our customers however we believe our mechanisms to manage product cost inflation some of which are contractual are sufficient to limit the impact on our cash flows from operations 

 

we believe that our cash flows from operations the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets including issuances of debt securities either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes we believe that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper market effectively as well as the longterm capital markets if necessary to further maintain and enhance our credit ratings on current and future debt on january 19 2011 the whollyowned us broadline subsidiaries of sysco corporation entered into full and unconditional guarantees of all outstanding senior notes and debentures of sysco corporation as of july 2 2011 sysco had a total of approximately 22 billion in senior notes and debentures outstanding that are covered by this guarantee 

 

operating activities 

 

we generated 11 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 09 billion in fiscal 2010 and 16 billion in fiscal 2009 the increase of 2061 million between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was driven largely by a reduction in the amount of payments made in relation to the irs settlement of 3160 million and reduced pension contributions in the amount of 1362 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 these increases were partially offset by changes in working capital discussed in more detail below the decrease of 6913 million between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was driven largely by 5280 million of payments related to the irs settlement and 1400 million of pension contributions made in advance for fiscal 2011 additionally several less significant items had offsetting impacts when comparing the cash flow from operations between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 as described under “other considerations bscc cooperative structure” we will make the final payments under the irs settlement in fiscal 2012 in the amount of 212 million 

 

cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011 was primarily generated by net income reduced by increases in receivables and inventory balances and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by noncash depreciation and amortization expense and increases in accounts payable cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to net income and noncash depreciation and amortization expense offset by decreases in accrued income taxes and other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to net income noncash depreciation and amortization expense an increase in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances the increases in fiscal 2009 were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable balances and accrued expenses 

 

the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were primarily due to sales growth an increase in daily sales outstanding also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2011 the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the sales decline the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was primarily from the growth in inventory resulting from sales growth the decrease in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily from inventory decreases resulting from the sales decline accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors including changes in product mix cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 

 

cash flow from operations was impacted by a decrease in accrued expenses of 433 million during fiscal 2011 an increase in accrued expenses of 580 million during fiscal 2010 and a decrease in accrued expenses of 1203 million during fiscal 2009 the decrease in accrued expenses in the fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the payment of the respective prior year annual incentive bonuses partially offset by lower accruals for current year compensation incentives the remainder of the decrease was driven by multiple changes in various other accruals of which no item was individually significant the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation accruals resulting from improved operating performance in fiscal 2010 the remainder of the increase was driven by multiple changes in various other accruals of which no item was individually significant the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive bonuses offset by lower accruals for current year incentive bonuses 

 

cash flow from operations for fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of 1652 million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of 442 million cash flow from operations for fiscal 2010 was negatively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of 1219 million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of 2965 million the main factor affecting both of these changes in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 as well as cash taxes paid was the irs settlement discussed below in “other considerations bscc cooperative 

structure” which resulted in the payment of taxes of 2120 million in fiscal 2011 and 5280 million in fiscal 2010 for the settlement agreement partially offsetting the negative impact described above the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities was impacted by the contribution of an additional 1400 million to our companysponsored qualified pension plan in fiscal 2010 for contributions that would normally have been made in fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations for fiscal 2009 was positively impacted by an increase in accrued income taxes of 3255 million partially offset by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of 2942 million total cash taxes paid were 9077 million 11420 million and 7358 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the changes in all periods were also impacted by the current tax provision and current year estimated tax payments 

 

other longterm liabilities increased 443 million during fiscal 2011 the increase for 2011 was primarily attributable to three items first we recorded withdrawal liabilities from multiemployer pension plans from which union members elected to withdraw during the period second net company sponsored pension costs exceeded contributions to our companysponsored pension plans during the period third we recognized a provision for severance resulting from the implementation of an involuntary severance plan partially offsetting these increases our liability for uncertain tax positions decreased as a result of settlements with various taxing authorities during the period 

 

other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net decreased 2717 million during fiscal 2010 the decrease in fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to three items first pension contributions to our companysponsored plans exceeded net companysponsored pension costs second our liability for deferred incentive compensation decreased due to accelerated distributions taken by plan participants of all or a portion of their vested balances pursuant to certain transitional relief under the provisions of section 409a of the internal revenue code and other regular distributions third our liability for uncertain tax positions decreased as a result of the settlement with the irs as well as a reclass to accrued income taxes for amounts expected to be paid in fiscal 2011 

 

other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net decreased 484 million during fiscal 2009 the decrease in fiscal 2009 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax benefits related to our settlement with the irs see additional discussion of an irs settlement at “other considerations bscc cooperative structure” the decrease was partially offset by a combination of the recording of net companysponsored pension costs and incentive compensation deferrals 

 

we recorded net companysponsored pension costs of 1864 million 1261 million and 887 million during fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively our contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit plans were 1617 million 2979 million and 958 million during fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively included in the 1617 million of contributions in fiscal 2011 was a 1400 million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal 2012 included in the 2979 million of contributions in fiscal 2010 was a 1400 million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal 2011 and quarterly contributions totaling 1400 million for fiscal 2010 additional contributions to our retirement plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal 2012 however we will evaluate our funding position at the end of fiscal 2012 and select the timing for a contribution at that time

fiscal 2010 capital expenditures included 

 

  

fiscal 2009 capital expenditures included 

 

 25

financing activities 

 

equity 

 

proceeds from common stock reissued from treasury for sharebased compensation awards were 3327 million in fiscal 2011 948 million in fiscal 2010 and 1118 million in fiscal 2009 the increase in proceeds in fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and 2009 the level of option exercises and thus proceeds will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 

 

we traditionally have engaged in boardapproved share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 10000000 shares for 2916 million in fiscal 2011 6000000 shares for 1792 million in fiscal 2010 and 16951200 shares for 4388 million in fiscal 2009 there were no additional shares repurchased through august 17 2011 resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 13386600 shares based on the trades made through that date our current share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our diluted average shares outstanding relatively constant based on forecasted and past share exercises pursuant to our option plans we expect to repurchase slightly more shares in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 

 

dividends paid were 5971 million or 102 per share in fiscal 2011 5798 million or 098 per share in fiscal 2010 and 5482 million or 092 per share in fiscal 2009 in may 2011 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 of 026 per share which was paid in july 2011 

 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 17 2011 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

 

shortterm borrowings 

 

we have uncommitted bank lines of credit which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to 950 million of which none was outstanding as of july 2 2011 or august 17 2011 

 

our irish subsidiary pallas foods limited has a €100 million euro committed facility for unsecured borrowings for working capital there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of july 2 2011 or august 17 2011 

 

on june 30 2011 a canadian subsidiary of sysco entered into a shortterm demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the canadian subsidiary to sysco and sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan the amount borrowed was 1820 million and was repaid in full on july 4 2011 

 

commercial paper and revolving credit facility 

 

we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billion 

 

sysco and one of our subsidiaries sysco international ulc have a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs the facility in the amount of 10 billion expires on november 4 2012 but is subject to extension 

 

during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to 3303 million zero to 18 million and zero to 1650 million respectively there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of july 2 2011 and 3000 million of commercial paper issuances outstanding as of august 17 2011 

 

during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 our aggregate commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 025 080 and 088 respectively 

fixed rate debt 

 

included in current maturities of longterm debt as july 2 2011 are the 610 senior notes totaling 2000 million which mature in june 2012 these notes were issued by sysco international co a whollyowned subsidiary of sysco now known as sysco international ulc it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through issuances of commercial paper senior notes or a combination thereof 

 

in february 2009 sysco deregistered the securities remaining unsold under its then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the sec in february 2008 for the issuance of debt securities in february 2009 sysco filed with the sec an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 

 

in march 2009 sysco issued 5375 senior notes totaling 2500 million due march 17 2019 the 2019 notes and 6625 senior notes totaling 2500 million due march 17 2039 the 2039 notes under its february 2009 shelf registration the 2019 and 2039 notes which were priced at 99321 and 98061 of par respectively are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions refinancing of debt working capital share repurchases and capital expenditures 

 

in september 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2000 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 to floating rate debt in october 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2500 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 to floating rate debt both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

 

total debt 

 

total debt as of july 2 2011 was 27 billion of which approximately 75 was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 59 and an average life of 15 years and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 21 and an average life of one year certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders including provisions to maintain the company’s longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level sysco is currently in compliance will all debt covenants 

 

other 

 

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements as of july 2 2011 and july 3 2010 letters of credit outstanding were 230 million and 284 million respectively 

 

other considerations 

 

multiemployer pension plans 

 

as discussed in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities generally sysco does not have the greatest share of liability among the participants in any of the plans in which we participate based on the information available from plan administrators which has valuation dates ranging from january 31 2009 to december 31 2009 we estimate our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 2000 million as of july 2 2011 based on a voluntary withdrawal this estimate excludes plans for which sysco has recorded withdrawal liabilities the majority of the plans we participate in have a valuation date of calendar yearend as such the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results from plans for which the valuation date was december 31 2009 therefore our estimated liability reflects the asset losses incurred by the financial markets as of that date due to the lack of current information we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate in addition if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements the irs may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5 on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund 

 

from time to time we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the union members of one of our subsidiaries voted to withdraw from the union’s multiemployer pension plan and join sysco’s companysponsored retirement plan this action triggered a partial withdrawal from the multiemployer pension plan as a result during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we recorded a withdrawal liability provision of approximately 361 million related to this plan we have experienced other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans total withdrawal liability provisions recorded include 415 million in fiscal 2011 29 million in fiscal 2010 and 96 million in fiscal 2009 as of july 2 2011 we had approximately 424 million in liabilities recorded related to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal had already occurred which includes the liability recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 recorded withdrawal liabilities are estimated at the time of withdrawal based on 

the most recently available valuation and participant data for the respective plans amounts are adjusted up to the period of payment to reflect any changes to these estimates if any of these plans were to undergo a mass withdrawal as defined by the pension benefit guaranty corporation within a two year time frame from the point of our withdrawal we could have additional liability we do not currently believe any mass withdrawals are probable to occur in the applicable two year time frame relating to the plans from which we have voluntarily withdrawn 

 

required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 

 

during fiscal 2008 we obtained information that a multiemployer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded that it was probable that additional funding would be required as well as the payment of excise tax as a result during fiscal 2008 we recorded a liability of approximately 165 million related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we effectively withdrew from this multiemployer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits for our employees that were participants in the plan and to manage our exposure to this underfunded plan we agreed to pay 150 million to the plan which included the minimum funding requirements in connection with this withdrawal agreement we merged active participants from this plan into sysco’s companysponsored retirement plan and assumed 267 million in liabilities the payment to the plan was made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 

 

bscc cooperative structure 

 

sysco’s affiliate baugh supply chain cooperative bscc was a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code the operation of which had resulted in a deferral of tax payments the irs in connection with its audits of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts sysco reached a settlement with the irs in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis pay the amounts that were recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a threeyear period and make a onetime payment of 410 million of which approximately 390 million was nondeductible the settlement addressed the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns and settles the matter for all subsequent periods including the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns already under audit as a result of the settlement we agreed to pay the amounts owed in the following schedule 

 

 

 

as noted in the table above payments related to the settlement were 2120 million and 5280 million in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively remaining amounts to be paid in 2012 will be paid in connection with our quarterly tax payments two of which fall in the second quarter one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter we believe we have access to sufficient cash on hand cash flows from operations and current access to capital to make payments required in fiscal 2012 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table sets forth as of july 2 2011 certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

 

 

 

  

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july 2 2011 included 566 million this amount is not included in the table above 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for 

doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries in addition in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate as was the case in fiscal 2009 additional allowances may be required 

 

selfinsurance program 

 

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

 

companysponsored pension plans 

 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

 

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 2011 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the july 3 2010 measurement date decreased 187 basis points to 615 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2011 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the july 3 2010 measurement date decreased 79 basis points to 635 the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2011 by an estimated 856 million the discount rate for determining fiscal 2012 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the july 2 2011 measurement date decreased 21 basis points to 594 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2012 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the july 2 2011 measurement date decreased 42 basis points to 593 the combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2012 by an estimated 143 million a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2012 would decrease sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by 590 million while a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by 687 million the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 100 basis point decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates therefore a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

 

we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels we used a plan specific agerelated set of rates for the retirement plan which are equivalent to a single rate of 530 as of july 2 2011 and july 3 2010 for determining the benefit obligations as of july 2 2011 and july 3 2010 the serp calculations use an agegraded salary growth assumption 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 800 for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 81 40 41 and 185 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2010 respectively in addition in nine of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 775 for fiscal 2012 a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2012 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2012 by approximately 209 million 

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 2 2011 was a charge net of tax of 5011 million the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 3 2010 was a charge net of tax of 5988 million 

 

changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions increased net companysponsored pension costs by approximately 60 million in fiscal 2011 changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods the impact of plan amendments and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to decrease net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2012 by approximately 27 million 

 

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of 1617 million and 2979 million in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 respectively included in the 1617 million of contributions in fiscal 2011 was a 1400 million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal 2012 we did not have a minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar 2010 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements included in the 2979 million of contributions in fiscal 2010 the minimum required contribution for the calendar 2009 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements as well as a 1400 million contribution to our retirement plan that would normally have been made in fiscal 2011 we do not have a minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar 2011 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements that must be made in fiscal 2012 additional contributions to our retirement plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal 2012 however we will evaluate our funding position at the end of fiscal 2012 and select the timing for a contribution at that time the estimated fiscal 2012 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately 23 million 

 

income taxes 

 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

 

vendor consideration 

 

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in some instances vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold our inventory turnover is usually less than one month therefore amounts deferred against inventory do not require longterm estimation in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized historically adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 

 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

 

in addition annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our eight operating segments as described in note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the components within each of our eight operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into eight reporting units 

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our eight operating segments we use a 60 weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and 40 for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management’s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

 

our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2010 and 2009 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2011 analysis our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis however we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for the following reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts first our reporting unit that distributes to international customers would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 26 lower second our european broadline company would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 27 lower third our lodging industry products reporting unit would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 29 lower lastly our specialty produce operations would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been 34 lower at july 2 2011 these four reporting units had goodwill aggregating 4983 million for the remainder of our reporting units which at july 2 2011 had goodwill aggregating 11 billion we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 50 

 

certain reporting units european broadline specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the united states broadline canadian broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the united states broadline canadian broadline and sygma reporting units in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the united states broadline reporting units as such these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

we provide compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plan and various nonemployee director plans 

 

as of july 2 2011 there was 613 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 262 years 

 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 

 

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

 

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction 

 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the compensation cost related to stock 

issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

 

certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period in those cases we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in other cases certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performancebased provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate in these cases if it is probable that the performance condition will be met we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the shorter performance period otherwise we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 

 

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that if the award holder retires at certain age and years of service thresholds the options continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director in these cases for awards granted prior to july 2 2005 our adoption date for the fair value recognition provisions in current stock compensation accounting standards we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires for awards granted subsequent to july 3 2005 we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 

 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business sales and expense trends including expectations regarding payrelated expense and pension costs anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expectations regarding share repurchases expected trends in fuel pricing usage costs and surcharges our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable expected implementation costs and benefits of the erp system estimated expenses and capital expenditures related to our business transformation project in fiscal 2012 our plan to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business the impact of ongoing legal proceedings the loss of sygma’s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of financing for them continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives anticipated companysponsored pension plan liabilities our expectations regarding cash flow from operations the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

 

these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item 1a above and elsewhere in addition the success of sysco’s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control including actions by our competitors andor customers we have experienced delays in the implementation of our business transformation project and the expected costs of our business transformation project may be greater or less than currently expected as we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems scheduling delays cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process as implementation of the erp system and the business transformation project begins there may be changes in design or timing that impact nearterm expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required which could also impact project expense and timing companysponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to the company’s other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally legal proceedings are impacted by events circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated stock repurchases at historical levels or other unexpected cash requirements predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect as well the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect and laws and regulations as well as methods of enforcement are subject to change

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

 

fiscal 2011 

 

as of july 2 2011 we had no commercial paper outstanding total debt as of july 2 2011 was 27 billion of which approximately 75 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

 

in fiscal 2010 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted 200 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 the fiscal 2014 swap and 250 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 the fiscal 2013 swap to floating rate debt both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

 

as of july 2 2011 the fiscal 2014 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 74 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly as of july 2 2011 the fiscal 2013 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 61 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 42 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly 

 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of july 2 2011 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

rate a — threemonth libor 

fiscal 2010 

 

as of july 3 2010 we had no commercial paper outstanding total debt as of july 3 2010 was 25 billion of which approximately 81 was at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

 

as of july 3 2010 the 2014 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 55 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly as of july 3 2010 the 2013 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 55 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 42 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly 

 

the following tables present our interest rate positions as of july 3 2010 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 05 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and 09 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2011 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2011 sales by 06 and would not have materially impacted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

 

our canadian financing subsidiary has the us dollar as its functional currency and has notes denominated in us dollars we have the potential to create taxable income in canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2011 yearend exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

fuel price risk 

 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased 

fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 06 06 and 08 of sales respectively fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges incurred by sysco increased by approximately 330 million in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 and decreased by 718 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 

 

we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of july 2 2011 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 86 million through june 2012 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 30 to 35 of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices lower than the current market price for diesel for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2012 and near the current market price for diesel for the remainder of the fiscal year 

 

fuel costs in fiscal 2012 exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 35 million to 45 million as compared to fiscal 2011 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2012 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential increase to 55 million to 65 million 

 

investment risk 

 

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets specifically decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations to the extent the financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plan at the plan’s fiscal year end december 31 2010 would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2012 however this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2012 by 398 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of july 2 2011 by 1297 million

operating segments 

sysco provides food and related products to the foodservice or foodawayfromhome industry under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined by accounting standards broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to their customers sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to chain restaurant customer locations our other segments include our specialty produce customcut meat and lodging industry products segments and a company that distributes to international customers specialty produce companies distribute fresh produce and on a limited basis other foodservice products specialty meat companies distribute customcut fresh steaks other meat seafood and poultry our lodging industry products company distributes personal care guest amenities equipment housekeeping supplies room accessories and textiles to the lodging industry selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in note 19 “business segment information” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

customers and products 

sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants hospitals schools hotels industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served services to our customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

the products we distribute include 

 

 

we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

 

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

 

 

 our operating companies distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through our more than 13000 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended july 3 2010 

based upon available information we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

sysco’s baugh supply chain cooperative inc bscc administers a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in bscc’s programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through bscc’s programs 

sysco’s national supply chain group a department at the corporate headquarters is focused on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels which reduces future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers one of the initiatives of this group is redistribution which involves the construction and operation of regional distribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region currently we have two rdcs in operation in virginia and florida and have made initial investments to build two additional rdcs management is evaluating the most appropriate timing for the building of these rdcs balancing both market conditions and the timing of the implementation of the company’s business transformation project see more discussion below under “capital improvements” 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources” at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

corporate headquarters’ services 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance treasury cash management information technology employee benefits engineering risk management and insurance sales and marketing payroll human resources training and development and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to modernize or construct new distribution facilities during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 5946 million 4646 million and 5160 million respectively were invested in facility expansions fleet additions and other capital asset enhancements we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 should be in the range of 700 million to 750 million during the three years ended july 3 2010 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2011 capital expenditures from the same sources 

we are undertaking a business transformation project pursuant to which we are developing and implementing an integrated software system to support a majority of our businesses and further streamline our operations these systems are commonly referred to as enterprise resource planning erp systems we have substantially completed the design and build phases of our business transformation project and we are currently testing the underlying erp system and processes implementation is anticipated to begin with the first operating company location in the first half of calendar 2011 and our 

shared business services center in fiscal 2011 approximately 160 million to 180 million of the fiscal 2011 estimated capital expenditures are related to the business transformation project 

employees 

as of july 3 2010 we had approximately 46000 fulltime employees approximately 18 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 28 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which have expired or will expire during fiscal 2011 and are subject to renegotiation since july 3 2010 two contracts covering 452 of such employees have been renegotiated we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

competition 

industry sources estimate that there are more than 16500 companies engaged in foodservice distribution in the united states our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors a few companies compete with us on a national basis we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices an additional competitive factor for our larger chain restaurant customers is the ability to provide a national distribution network we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we served about 17 of this approximately 210 billion annual market we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the united states and canada foodawayfromhome industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2010 while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our more than 8000 marketing associates our diversified product base which includes a differentiated group of high quality sysco brand products the diversity in the types of customers we serve our economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time and provides a national distribution network for larger chain restaurant customers we believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us the ability to continuously invest in our business including implementation of various supply chain and operational initiatives to improve efficiency and productivity we are the only publiclytraded distributor in the foodawayfromhome industry in the united states while our public company status provides us with some advantages including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

government regulation 

as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda as well as the canadian food and drugs act and the regulations thereunder 

the fda regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels regulates food contact packaging and materials and maintains a reportable food registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

in canada the canadian food inspection agency administers and enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards established by health canada under the canadian food and drugs act and under other related federal legislation including the canada agricultural products act the meat inspection act the fish inspection act and the consumer packaging and labeling act as it relates to food these laws regulate the processing storing grading packaging marking transporting and inspection of certain sysco product lines as well as the packaging labeling sale importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products 

we and our products are also subject to state provincial and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state provincial and local health agencies of state provincial and local standards for our products 

and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor together with similar occupational health and safety laws in each canadian province these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

we are also subject to regulation by numerous us and canadian federal state provincial and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor and each canadian provincial ministry of labour which set employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation and the canadian transportation agency which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks other us and canadian federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

general 

we have numerous trademarks which are of significant importance to the company we believe that the loss of the syscor trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

as of july 3 2010 we operated 180 distribution facilities throughout the united states canada and ireland 




 item 1a risk factors 

periods of difficult economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets affect consumer confidence which can adversely impact our business 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins and the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions from late in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets negatively affected consumer confidence and discretionary spending this led to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases these conditions in turn negatively impacted our sales as noted by our declining sequential sales trend each quarter from a positive 85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to a negative 81 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the development of similar economic conditions in the future or permanent changes in consumer dining habits as a result of such conditions would likely negatively impact our operating results although economic conditions appear to have improved since the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the perceived improvement may not continue or may not result in consumers returning to their prior dining habits 

periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation affect our product costs and profitability 

volatile food costs have a direct impact on our industry prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on all or a portion of such product cost increases to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability in addition product cost inflation may negatively impact consumer spending decisions which could adversely impact our sales conversely our business may be adversely impacted by periods of prolonged product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant our estimate for the deflation in sysco’s cost of goods was 15 in fiscal 2010 compared to inflation of 47 in fiscal 2009 and 60 in fiscal 2008 

our enterprisewide software integration project could experience implementation problems scheduling delays or cost overages and may not prove to be cost effective or result in the benefits we anticipate negatively impacting our business results of operations and liquidity 

in fiscal 2009 we commenced the design of an enterprisewide project to implement an integrated software system commonly referred to as an enterprise resource planning erp system to support a majority of our business processes and further streamline our operations we are currently testing the erp system and processes that have been designed and built and believe that implementation will occur across the majority of our broadline and sygma operating companies beginning in fiscal 2011 and ending in fiscal 2013 erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multiyear timeframe as is the case in most erp implementations we expect that the implementation of our erp system will require transformation of business and financial processes in order to realize the full benefits of the project although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the longterm the costs will exceed the benefits during the early stages of implementation including fiscal 2011 the expected costs of the project in fiscal 2011 may be greater or less than currently expected because as we begin implementation of the project we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget including the incurrence of expenses at an earlier or later time than currently anticipated our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems scheduling delays cost overages or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process in addition because the implementation is expected to involve a significant capital commitment our business results of operations and liquidity may also be adversely affected if the erp system and the associated process changes do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits that we anticipate 

we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs 

volatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our industry the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers in the past there is no guarantee that we can do so again if another period of high fuel costs occurs if fuel costs increase again in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability from time to time we enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements at prices equal to the thencurrent market price for diesel if fuel prices decrease significantly these forward purchases may prove ineffective and result in us paying higher than market costs for a portion of our diesel fuel 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs 

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third party suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us although our purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers shortterm weather conditions or more prolonged climate change crop conditions product recalls water shortages transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings 

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products anything that damages that reputation or the public’s confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of our products could quickly affect our revenues and profits reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact the public’s confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns such as flu epidemics or other pandemics even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically 

product liability claims could materially impact our business 

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

expanding into international markets and complimentary lines of business presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations and complimentary lines of business may not be successful 

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes the possibility of further expansion of operations into international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations 

another element of our strategy includes the possibility of expansion into businesses that are closely related or complimentary to but not currently part of our core foodservice distribution business our ability to successfully operate in these complimentary business markets may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with regulatory programs to which we become subject risks inherent in branching out into such complimentary markets also include the costs and difficulties of managing operations outside of our core business which may require additional skills and competencies as well as difficulties in identifying and gaining access to suppliers or customers in new markets 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively 

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact 

a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion we anticipate additional acquisitions and capital expansion in the future as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

technology dependence could have a material negative impact on our business 

our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs furthermore process changes may be required as we continue to use our existing warehousing delivery and payroll systems to support operations as we implement the erp system while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans 

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 11 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2010 our total contributions to these plans which include payments for voluntary withdrawals were approximately 515 million 

we do not directly manage these multiemployer plans which are generally managed by boards of trustees half of whom are appointed by the unions and the other half by other contributing employers to the plan based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding as a result we expect our required contributions to these plans to increase in the future 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the information currently available from plan administrators which has valuation dates ranging from january 31 2008 to june 30 2009 sysco estimates its share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans in which it participates could have been as much as 1830 million as of july 3 2010 based on a voluntary withdrawal the majority of the plans we participate in have a valuation date of calendar yearend as such the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results from plans for which the valuation date was december 31 2008 therefore our estimated liability reflects the asset losses incurred by the financial markets as of that date in general the financial markets improved during calendar year 2009 therefore we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could differ from this estimate in addition if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements the internal revenue service irs may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5 on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund as of july 3 2010 sysco had approximately 09 million in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal has already occurred requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 

our funding of our companysponsored pension plans may increase and our earnings may decrease should financial markets and the value of our company owned life insurance experience future declines 

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability our expense is also impacted by these items fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet at fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets as these are inputs in determining our discount rate at fiscal yearend specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent financial markets experience future declines similar to those experienced in fiscal 2008 through the beginning of fiscal 2010 andor interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets decline our contributions and pension expense may increase for future years as our funded status decreases which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations 

sysco invests in corporateowned life insurance policies in order to fund certain retirement programs which are subject to market risk the value of our investments in corporateowned life insurance coli policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments which include publicly traded securities therefore the value of these policies will be adjusted each period based on the performance of the underlying securities which has in the past resulted and could in the future further result in volatility in our earnings as of july 3 2010 our investments in coli policies were valued at 2032 million during periods of significant declines in the financial markets we experienced significant losses in adjusting the carrying value of these policies to their cash surrender values should the financial markets suffer significant declines again in the future we would take additional charges to adjust the carrying value of our coli policies which would increase our operating expenses and adversely impact our net earnings and earnings per share 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages 

as of july 3 2010 approximately 8400 employees at 51 operating companies were members of 55 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2011 12 agreements covering approximately 2400 employees have expired or will expire since july 3 2010 two contracts covering 452 of the 2400 employees have been renegotiated failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work 

stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings 

our operations rely heavily on our employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

our preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders 

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

highlights 

weak economic conditions in the united states and canada combined with lower consumer confidence contributed to a difficult business environment in fiscal 2010 however this environment improved as the year progressed although these factors unfavorably impacted financial results in fiscal 2010 improving sales trends in the second half of the year and our attention to cost control throughout the year helped us achieve earnings growth in fiscal 2010 we also settled an outstanding tax matter with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and recorded gains on corporateowned life insurance coli policies both of which positively impacted net earnings and earnings per share sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30 th  this resulted in a 53week year ending july 3 2010 for fiscal 2010 and 52week years ending june 27 2009 and june 28 2008 for fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are primarily located throughout the united states canada and ireland and include broadline companies specialty produce companies customcut meat operations hotel supply operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we served about 17 of this approximately 210 billion annual market according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 47 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states this share grew from about 37 in 1972 to nearly 50 in 1998 and did not change materially until 2009 when it declined to the current level of 47 

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately 59 in calendar year 2009 and 36 in calendar year 2008 real sales declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market historically we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 

strategy 

we continue to invest in our core business to expand our market share and grow earnings we will continue to use our strategies to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy handle and market products for our customers these strategies include 

 

our primary focus is on growing and optimizing our core foodservice distribution business in north america however we will continue to explore and identify opportunities to expand the core business by growth in new international markets and in other areas of business that complement our core foodservice distribution business as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 

business transformation project 

we have substantially completed the design and build phases of our business transformation project and we are currently testing the underlying erp system and processes implementation is anticipated to begin with the first operating company location in the first half of calendar 2011 and our shared business services center in fiscal 2011 implementation is anticipated to occur across the majority of our broadline and sygma operating companies by the end of fiscal 2013 although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the longterm the costs will exceed the benefits during the early stages of implementation including fiscal 2011 

we expect total cash outlay for the business transformation project to be approximately 900 million approximately 246 million of cash outlay was incurred in fiscal 2010 of which approximately 172 million was capitalized approximately 260 million to 300 million of cash outlay is expected in fiscal 2011 of which approximately 160 million to 180 million will be capitalized 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

 

impact of 53week fiscal year 

sysco’s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june 30 th  this resulted in a 53week year ending july 3 2010 for fiscal 2010 and 52week years ending june 27 2009 and june 28 2008 for fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2009 our results of operations for fiscal 2010 are not directly comparable to the prior year management believes that adjusting the fiscal 2010 results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a yearoveryear basis as a result the results of operations discussion for fiscal 2010 presented below in certain instances discusses operating items that have been adjusted by onefourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter except as otherwise noted with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share failure to make these adjustments would cause the yearoveryear changes in certain metrics such as sales operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated whereas in certain cases a metric may actually have declined on a more comparable yearoveryear basis our results of operations discussion includes reconciliations of the actual results for fiscal 2010 to the adjusted results for fiscal 2010 based on a 52week fiscal year 

sales 

sales for fiscal 2010 were 11 higher in fiscal 2010 than fiscal 2009 however the additional week contributed approximately 20 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2010 set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growthdecline for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year” above 

 

in addition to the extra week in fiscal 2010 improving case volumes increased sales the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 09 compared to fiscal 2009 sales from acquisitions within the last 12 months favorably impacted sales by 05 for fiscal 2010 product cost deflation and the resulting decrease in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal 2010 estimated changes in product costs an internal measure of deflation or inflation were estimated as deflation of 15 during fiscal 2010 a change in customer sales mix as compared to fiscal 2009 also negatively impacted fiscal 2010 sales case volumes increased at a greater rate within our contract based customer group which generally receives lower pricing for higher volume 

sales for fiscal 2009 were 18 less than fiscal 2008 product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal 2009 estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were approximately 47 during fiscal 2009 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 12 compared to fiscal 2008 noncomparable acquisitions offset the rate of sales decline by 02 for fiscal 2009 

our sequential quarterly sales trend demonstrated a decline throughout most of fiscal 2008 all of fiscal 2009 and into the second quarter of fiscal 2010 ranging from a positive 85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to a negative 81 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 our sales trend turned positive in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 to 24 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2009 a result largely driven by improving case volumes and favorable foreign exchange rates this positive trend continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we experienced estimated product cost inflation during the four quarters of fiscal 2009 ranging from 05 to 83 during fiscal 2010 we experienced estimated product cost deflation of approximately 15 during the four quarters of fiscal 2010 we experienced product cost deflation in the first three quarters of the fiscal year as high as 35 and product cost inflation in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year of 22 we believe the weak economic conditions experienced in fiscal 2009 and much of fiscal 2010 which placed pressure on consumer disposable income are constricting growth in the foodservice market and in turn have contributed to reduced sales growth rates while economic conditions are showing signs of improvement we believe consumer disposable income will remain under pressure which could continue to affect sales 

we believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities commitment to quality investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthening customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers we also believe these activities help our customers in this difficult economic environment 

operating income 

cost of sales primarily includes our product costs net of vendor consideration and includes inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 

operating income increased 55 in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 to 20 billion and as a percentage of sales increased to 53 of sales this increase in operating income was primarily driven by the additional week included in fiscal 2010 and a decrease in operating expenses gross margin dollars increased 10 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 while operating expenses decreased 06 in fiscal 2010 set forth below is a reconciliation of actual operating income to adjusted operating income for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year” above 

 

operating income decreased 04 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 to 19 billion or 51 of sales operating income declined primarily due to a decline in sales partially offset by a decline in operating expenses gross margin dollars decreased 22 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and operating expenses decreased 28 in fiscal 2009 

gross margin dollars increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the additional week included in fiscal 2010 in addition gross margins reflected product cost deflation in fiscal 2010 as compared to product cost inflation in fiscal 2009 we may be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant gross margin dollars for fiscal 2010 were also impacted by lower fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 185 million lower in fiscal 2010 than fiscal 2009 assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2011 we do not expect fuel surcharges to change significantly in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

gross margin dollars for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were impacted by product cost inflation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 sysco began experiencing high levels of product cost increases in numerous product categories these increases persisted throughout fiscal 2008 at levels approximating 60 and rose even higher to 76 in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 the level of product cost increases began moderating during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and was 05 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 generally sysco attempts to pass increased costs to its customers however because of contractual and competitive reasons we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately prolonged periods of high inflation such as those experienced in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 have a negative impact on our customers as high food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodawayfrom home market as a result these factors may negatively impact our sales gross margins and earnings fuel surcharges were approximately 50 million higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 usage of these surcharges was greater in the second half of fiscal 2008 and the first half of fiscal 2009 due to sustained increased market diesel prices during that period 

operating expenses for fiscal 2010 were lower than in fiscal 2009 primarily due to reduced fuel costs and a favorable comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in both periods partially offsetting these operating expense declines were increases in payrelated expenses net companysponsored pension costs and approximately 998 million of expense associated with the additional week included in fiscal 2010 

operating expenses for fiscal 2009 were lower than in fiscal 2008 primarily due to operating efficiencies and lower payroll expense related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation the positive impact of these expense reductions was partially offset by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables in addition our fuel costs increased during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

sysco’s fuel costs decreased by 718 million in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreased contracted diesel prices our fuel costs increased by 332 million in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices sysco’s costs per gallon decreased 261 in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 compared to an increase of 186 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 sysco’s activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 

we periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements in fiscal 2010 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 15 million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes for a portion of the fiscal year in fiscal 2009 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 680 million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2008 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 210 million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 

as of july 3 2010 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 93 million through september 2011 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 30 to 35 of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal 2011 fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 10 million to 20 million as compared to fiscal 2010 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2011 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 

we adjust the carrying values of our corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments which include publicly traded securities as a result the cash surrender values of these policies will fluctuate with changes in the market value of such securities the changes in the financial markets resulted in gains for these policies of 216 million in fiscal 2010 compared to losses for these policies of 438 million in fiscal 2009 and 87 million in fiscal 2008 the performance of the financial markets will continue to influence the cash surrender values of our corporateowned life insurance policies which could cause volatility in operating income net earnings and earnings per share 

the provision for losses on receivables included within operating expenses decreased by 397 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 and increased by 425 million in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 the decrease in our provision for losses on receivables in fiscal 2010 reflects fewer customer accounts exceeding our threshold for writeoff in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2009 the economic conditions and related decrease in consumer demand combined with tightening credit markets impacted the liquidity of some of our customers resulting in an increase in delinquent payments on accounts receivable the increase in our provision for losses on receivables in fiscal 2009 was related to customer accounts across our customer base without concentration in any specific location customer accounts written off net of recoveries were 343 million or 010 of sales 719 million or 020 of sales and 324 million or 009 of sales for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our provision for losses on receivables will fluctuate with general market conditions as well as the circumstances of our customers 

payrelated expenses excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project increased by 439 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 and decreased by 1992 million in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 the fiscal 2010 increase was primarily due to increased provisions for management incentive accruals and cost associated with the additional week included in fiscal 2010 partially offsetting these increases were lower payrelated expenses due to reduced headcount the fiscal 2009 decline was due to a combination of reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation the criteria for paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to overall company performance in fiscal 2010 the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses was met therefore the provision for current management incentive bonuses was higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 when the company assessed it did not meet the criteria for paying certain annual bonuses in fiscal 2009 the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses were not met therefore corporate executive officers did not receive bonuses for fiscal 2009 and operating company management bonuses were at lower levels for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 headcount declines occurred due to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions commensurate with lower sales headcount was 22 lower at the end of fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and 58 lower at the end of fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2010 were 374 million higher than in fiscal 2009 net companysponsored pension costs were 229 million higher in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 the increase in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to lower returns on assets of sysco’s companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal 2009 partially offset by an increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal 2010 the increase in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to lower returns on assets of sysco’s retirement plan during fiscal 2008 and the merging of participants from a multiemployer pension plan to the retirement plan partially offset by a decrease in expense due to an increase in the discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liabilities and amendments to our supplemental executive retirement plan serp net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2011 are expected to increase by approximately 603 million over fiscal 2010 due primarily to a decrease in discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense partially offset by reduced amortization of expense from actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of sysco’s retirement plan during fiscal 2010 

expenses related to our business transformation project inclusive of payrelated expense increased by 416 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 our business transformation project began in january 2009 therefore fiscal 2009 only included six months of activity sysco redeployed employees to work on the business transformation project and did not backfill all of these positions therefore not all expenses related to this project are incremental from operating expenses incurred by sysco in the applicable periods in the prior fiscal year additionally certain labor costs which would have been expensed absent this project are being capitalized as software costs as a result of this project we believe the increase in total expense including all 

payrelated expenses related to the business transformation project in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 will be approximately 25 million to 45 million

we recorded provisions related to multiemployer pension plans of 29 million in fiscal 2010 96 million in fiscal 2009 and 223 million in fiscal 2008 see additional discussion of multiemployer pension plans at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations multiemployer pension plans” 

sharebased compensation expense decreased 246 million in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 contributing to the decrease in fiscal 2009 was reduction in the level of option grants being awarded compared to previous years resulting in reduced compensation expenses being recognized also affecting the decrease in fiscal 2009 was the removal of the previous stock award component from the management incentive plan annual bonus awards beginning with fiscal 2009 as a result the sharebased compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years was not incurred in fiscal 2009 and overall sharebased compensation expense was reduced as compared to fiscal 2008 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 117 in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 due primarily to the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below as well as the factors discussed above including the additional week in fiscal 2010 set forth below is a reconciliation of actual net earnings to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year” above 

 

net earnings declined 45 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below as well as the factors discussed above 

the effective tax rate was 3620 in fiscal 2010 4037 in fiscal 2009 and 3825 in fiscal 2008 

the effective tax rate of 3620 for fiscal 2010 was favorably impacted by two items first we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately 290 million resulting from the onetime reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement with the irs see “liquidity and capital resources other considerations bscc cooperative structure” for additional discussion second the gain of 216 million which had a tax impact of 83 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal 2010 was nontaxable for income tax purposes and had the impact of decreasing the effective tax rate in the period 

the effective tax rate of 4037 for fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted primarily by two factors first we recorded tax adjustments related to federal and state uncertain tax positions of 310 million second the loss of 438 million which had a tax impact of 168 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values was nondeductible for income tax purposes and had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the period the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances of 78 million previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets 

the effective tax rate of 3825 for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately 77 million resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change 86 million related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and 55 million related to the reduction in net canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was unfavorably impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions sharebased compensation expense and the recognition of losses of 87 million which had an unfavorable tax impact of 33 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 

earnings per share 

both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 124 in fiscal 2010 from the prior year basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased 33 and 22 respectively in fiscal 2009 over the prior year these changes were primarily the result of factors discussed above including the additional week in fiscal 2010 as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and an increase in the number of antidilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation 

both basic and diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted by 009 per share in fiscal 2010 due to the onetime reversal of interest accruals for the tax contingency related to the irs settlement and the gains recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values this compares to a 007 per share negative impact to earnings per share in fiscal 2009 from the losses recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 

set forth below is a reconciliation of actual diluted earnings per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods presented see further discussion at “impact of 53week fiscal year” above 

 

as compared to fiscal 2010 increased net companysponsored pension costs and additional expense from our business transformation project will negatively impact both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 

segment results 

we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results which include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment and intersegment sales expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales including intersegment sales and operating income respectively for purposes of this statistical table operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of 2696 million in fiscal 2010 2193 million in fiscal 2009 and 1967 million in fiscal 2008 that are not charged to our segments this information should be read in conjunction with note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

included in corporate expenses among other items are 

 

broadline segment 

the broadline reportable segment consists of the aggregated results of the united states canadian and european broadline segments broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to customers broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2010 the broadline operating results represented approximately 80 of sysco’s overall sales and 92 of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment’s earnings 

sales 

sales for fiscal 2010 were 17 greater than fiscal 2009 case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 10 compared to fiscal 2009 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 06 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2010 product cost deflation which led to decreases in selling prices and a change in customer sales mix partially offset case volume improvement in fiscal 2010 the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2010 

sales for fiscal 2009 were 20 less than fiscal 2008 case volume declines attributable to the impact of the negative business environment caused a decline in sales in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 15 compared to fiscal 2008 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 02 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2009 product cost inflation which led to increases in selling prices partially offset case volume declines in fiscal 2009 

operating income 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 was primarily due to effective management of operations in the current economic environment by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods operating expenses decreased 14 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the additional week in fiscal 2010 contributed to the gross margin increase partially offset by a decrease of approximately 374 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to less usage of these surcharges in fiscal 2010 expense performance for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to reduced fuel cost and lower provision for losses on receivables and operating efficiencies such as reduced pay—related expense due to reduced headcount fuel costs were 506 million lower in fiscal 2010 than in the prior year partially offsetting these expense declines were increases in expenses related to the additional week in fiscal 2010 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 was primarily due to effective management of operations in the weak economic environment effective management was also evidenced by margins declining at a lower rate than our sales decline and by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods gross margin dollars decreased 17 while operating expenses decreased 32 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 offsetting the gross margin decline was an increase in fuel surcharges of 90 million as a result of increased usage of fuel surcharges in the first half of fiscal 2009 due to sustained increased market diesel prices expense performance for fiscal 2009 was aided by lower payrollrelated expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on receivables and increased fuel cost fuel costs were 288 million higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 

we attempt to mitigate fuel costs by reducing miles driven improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2011 we expect fuel costs for our broadline segment to increase by approximately 7 million to 14 million as compared to fiscal 2010 and we do not expect fuel surcharges to change significantly in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

we recorded provisions related to multiemployer pension plans of 29 million in fiscal 2010 96 million in fiscal 2009 and 223 million in fiscal 2008 

sygma segment 

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

sales 

sales were 11 greater in fiscal 2010 than fiscal 2009 and 58 greater in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 the additional week contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2010 case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 this case growth was largely attributable to new customers added largely in the latter part of the fiscal 

year and the additional week in fiscal 2010 partially offsetting these case volume improvements was a decline in volume from existing customers due to the weak economic environment which applied continued pressure to consumer discretionary spending and negatively impacted overall restaurant traffic counts product cost deflation which led to decreases in selling prices also impacted fiscal 2010 sales growth in fiscal 2009 sales growth was primarily due to significant contracts with new customers and product cost increases which led to increases in selling prices these increases were partially offset by lost sales due to the elimination of unprofitable business and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting sygma’s existing customer base 

one chain restaurant customer wendy’sarby’s group inc accounted for approximately 33 of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended july 3 2010 sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

operating income 

operating income increased by 171 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 gross margin dollars increased 07 while operating expenses decreased 37 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the additional week in fiscal 2010 contributed to the gross margin increase partially offset by a decrease of approximately 114 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to lower fuel prices in fiscal 2010 expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions also contributing to the decrease in operating expenses was a decrease of 101 million in fuel costs in fiscal 2010 from the prior year due to lower fuel prices 

operating income increased by 219 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 gross margin dollars increased 04 while operating expenses decreased 51 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 offsetting the gross margin increase was a decrease of approximately 50 million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions offsetting these expense declines were increased fuel costs of 20 million in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 

assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal 2011 we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment to increase as compared to fiscal 2010 

other segment 

 “other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce customcut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 

on an aggregate basis our “other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry these operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in fiscal 2010 in the aggregate the “other” segment represented approximately 85 of sysco’s overall sales and 55 of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

operating income increased 208 for fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in our specialty produce segment and increased operating income in all segments due to favorable expense management the additional week in fiscal 2010 also contributed to the increase in operating income 

operating income decreased 258 for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 the decrease in operating income was caused primarily by reduced sales in all segments attributable to the deteriorating economic environment 

liquidity and capital resources 

sysco’s strategic objectives require continuing investment and our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is generally allocated to working capital requirements investments in facilities systems fleet other equipment and technology acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy and cash dividends any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments or applied toward the cost of the share repurchase program as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and 

sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure these transactions may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we believe that our cash flows from operations the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes we have continued to maintain the highest credit rating available for us commercial paper we believe that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper market effectively as well as the longterm capital markets if necessary 

operating activities 

we generated 09 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 16 billion in fiscal 2009 and 16 billion in fiscal 2008 the decrease of 6913 million between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was driven largely by 5280 million of payments related to the irs settlement and 1400 million of pension contributions made in advance for fiscal 2011 additionally several less significant items had offsetting impacts when comparing the cash flow from operations between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 as described under “other considerations bscc cooperative structure” we will continue to make payments under the irs settlement in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 in the amount of 212 million per year if equivalent levels of net earnings are achieved in fiscal 2011 we expect cash flows from operations to increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to net income and noncash depreciation and amortization expense offset by decreases in accrued income taxes and other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to net income noncash depreciation and amortization expense an increase in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances the increases in fiscal 2009 were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable balances and accrued expenses cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to net income changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and noncash depreciation and amortization expense the increases in fiscal 2008 were reduced by decreases in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances 

the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to sales growth the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the sales decline the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to sales growth the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2010 was primarily from the growth in inventory resulting from sales growth the decrease in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily from inventory decreases resulting from the sales decline the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory increases resulting from sales growth accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors including changes in product mix cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 

cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by an increase in accrued expenses of 580 million during fiscal 2010 cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by decreases in accrued expenses of 1203 million during fiscal 2009 and 227 million during fiscal 2008 the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation accruals resulting from improved operating performance in fiscal 2010 the remainder of the increase was driven by multiple changes in various other accruals of which no item was individually significant the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive bonuses offset by lower accruals for current year incentive bonuses the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixedrate debt issued in fiscal 2008 and an increase to a provision related to a multiemployer pension plan see additional discussion of multiemployer pension plans at “other considerations multiemployer pension plans” 

in fiscal 2007 we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of 503 million within accrued expenses and a corresponding insurance receivable of 483 million within prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal 2008 these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment 

cash flow from operations for fiscal 2010 was negatively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of 1219 million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of 2965 million the main factor affecting both of these items as well as cash taxes paid was the irs settlement discussed below in “other considerations bscc cooperative structure” which resulted in the payment of taxes of 5280 million in fiscal 2010 for the settlement agreement as well as higher estimated tax payments for ongoing operations in fiscal 2010 offsetting the negative impact described above the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities was impacted by the contribution of an additional 1400 million to our companysponsored qualified pension plan in fiscal 2010 for contributions that would normally have been made in fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations for fiscal 2009 was positively impacted by an increase in accrued income taxes of 3255 million partially offset by changes in 

deferred tax assets and liabilities of 2942 million cash flow from operations for fiscal 2008 was positively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of 6435 million partially offset by a decrease in accrued income taxes of 5098 million total cash taxes paid were 11420 million 7358 million and 5302 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net decreased 2717 million during fiscal 2010 decreased 484 million during fiscal 2009 and increased 135 million during fiscal 2008 the decrease in fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to three items first pension contributions to our companysponsored plans exceeded net companysponsored pension costs second our liability for deferred incentive compensation decreased due to accelerated distributions taken by plan participants of all or a portion of their vested balances pursuant to certain transitional relief under the provisions of section 409a of the internal revenue code and other regular distributions third our liability for uncertain tax positions decreased as a result of the settlement with the irs as well as a reclass to accrued income taxes for amounts expected to be paid in fiscal 2011 the decrease in fiscal 2009 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax benefits related to our settlement with the irs see additional discussion of an irs settlement at “other considerations bscc cooperative structure” the decrease was partially offset by a combination of the recording of net companysponsored pension costs and incentive compensation deferrals the increase for fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to a combination of the recording of net companysponsored pension costs incentive compensation deferrals and a net increase to our liability for uncertain tax positions partially offset by pension contributions to our companysponsored plans we recorded net companysponsored pension costs of 1261 million 887 million and 658 million during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively our contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit plans were 2979 million 958 million and 927 million during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively we contributed 1400 million to our companysponsored qualified pension plan in fiscal 2010 for contributions that would normally have been made in fiscal 2011 additional contributions to our companysponsored qualified pension plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal 2011 

investing activities 

fiscal 2010 capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2009 capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included 

 

we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 to be in the range of 7000 million to 7500 million fiscal 2011 expenditures will include facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions new facility construction including foldout facilities and investments in technology including our business transformation project 

during fiscal 2010 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 293 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2010 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2010 we acquired for cash a broadline foodservice operation in syracuse new york a produce distributor in atlanta georgia and a seafood distributor in edmonton alberta canada 

during fiscal 2009 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 2181 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2009 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2009 we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in ireland los angeles california and boston massachusetts as well as a produce distributor in toronto ontario canada 

during fiscal 2008 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 553 million for operations acquired during fiscal 2008 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2008 we acquired for cash produce distributors in jacksonville florida and miami florida a specialty meat company in vancouver british columbia canada and a lodging industry supply company in hong kong 

financing activities 

equity 

we traditionally have engaged in boardapproved share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 6000000 shares for 1792 million in fiscal 2010 16951200 shares for 4388 million in fiscal 2009 and 16769900 shares for 5292 million in fiscal 2008 an additional 1230427 shares were repurchased at a cost of 371 million through august 18 2010 resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 2156173 shares based on the trades made through that date on august 27 2010 the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program covering an additional 20000000 shares our current share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our diluted average shares outstanding relatively constant based on forecasted share exercises pursuant to our option plans we expect to repurchase more shares in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 

dividends paid were 5798 million or 098 per share in fiscal 2010 5482 million or 092 per share in fiscal 2009 and 4975 million or 082 per share in fiscal 2008 in may 2010 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 of 025 per share which was paid in july 2010 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 18 2010 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

shortterm borrowings 

we have uncommitted bank lines of credit which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to 880 million of which none was outstanding as of july 3 2010 or august 18 2010 

our irish subsidiary pallas foods limited has a €100 million euro committed facility for unsecured borrowings for working capital there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of july 3 2010 or august 18 2010 

commercial paper and revolving credit facility 

we have a boardapproved commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 13 billion 

sysco and one of our subsidiaries sysco international co have a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs the facility in the amount of 10 billion expires on november 4 2012 but is subject to extension 

during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to 18 million zero to 1650 million zero to 11132 million respectively there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of july 3 2010 or august 18 2010 

fixed rate debt 

in january 2008 the sec granted our request to terminate our then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the sec in april 2005 for the issuance of debt securities in february 2008 we filed an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to 10 billion in debt securities with the sec 

in february 2008 we issued 420 senior notes totaling 2500 million due february 12 2013 the 2013 notes and 525 senior notes totaling 5000 million due february 12 2018 the 2018 notes under our february 2008 shelf registration the 2013 and 2018 notes which were priced at 99835 and 99310 of par respectively are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of february 2008 

in february 2009 sysco deregistered the securities remaining unsold under its then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the sec in february 2008 for the issuance of debt securities in february 2009 sysco filed with the sec an 

automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 

in march 2009 sysco issued 5375 senior notes totaling 2500 million due march 17 2019 the 2019 notes and 6625 senior notes totaling 2500 million due march 17 2039 the 2039 notes under its february 2009 shelf registration the 2019 and 2039 notes which were priced at 99321 and 98061 of par respectively are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes which may include acquisitions refinancing of debt working capital share repurchases and capital expenditures 

in september 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2000 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 to floating rate debt in october 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2500 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 to floating rate debt both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

total debt 

total debt as of july 3 2010 was 25 billion of which approximately 81 was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 59 and an average life of 16 years and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 23 certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders including provisions to maintain the company’s longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level sysco was in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 3 2010 

other 

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements as of july 3 2010 and june 27 2009 letters of credit outstanding were 284 million and 747 million respectively 

other considerations 

multiemployer pension plans 

as discussed in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities generally sysco does not have the greatest share of liability among the participants in any of these plans based on the information available from plan administrators which has valuation dates ranging from january 31 2008 to june 30 2009 we estimate our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans in which we participate could have been as much as 1830 million as of july 3 2010 based on a voluntary withdrawal the majority of the plans we participate in have a valuation date of calendar yearend as such the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results from plans for which the valuation date was december 31 2008 therefore our estimated liability reflects the asset losses incurred by the financial markets as of that date in general the financial markets improved during calendar year 2009 therefore we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could differ from this estimate in addition if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements the irs may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5 on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund as of july 3 2010 we have approximately 09 million in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal had already occurred 

required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 

during fiscal 2008 we obtained information that a multiemployer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded that it was probable that additional funding would be 

required as well as the payment of excise tax as a result during fiscal 2008 we recorded a liability of approximately 165 million related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we effectively withdrew from this multiemployer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits for our employees that were participants in the plan and to manage our exposure to this underfunded plan we agreed to pay 150 million to the plan which included the minimum funding requirements in connection with this withdrawal agreement we merged active participants from this plan into sysco’s companysponsored retirement plan and assumed 267 million in liabilities the payment to the plan was made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 if this plan were to undergo a mass withdrawal as defined by the pension benefit guaranty corporation prior to september 2010 we could have additional liability we do not currently believe a mass withdrawal from this plan prior to september 2010 is probable 

we have experienced other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans total withdrawal liability provisions recorded include 29 million in fiscal 2010 96 million in fiscal 2009 and 223 million in fiscal 2008 

bscc cooperative structure 

sysco’s affiliate baugh supply chain cooperative bscc is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments the irs in connection with its audits of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts sysco reached a settlement with the irs in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis pay the amounts that were recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a threeyear period and make a onetime payment of 410 million of which approximately 390 million is nondeductible the settlement addresses the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns and settles the matter for all subsequent periods including the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns already under audit as a result of the settlement we will pay the amounts owed in the following schedule 

 

as noted in the table above 5280 million was paid related to settlement in fiscal 2010 amounts to be paid in fiscal 2011 and 2012 will be paid in connection with our quarterly tax payments two of which fall in the second quarter one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter we believe we have access to sufficient cash on hand cash flows from operations and current access to capital to make payments on all of the amounts noted above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of july 3 2010 certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

 

 

 certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july 3 2010 included 528 million in cash this amount is not included in the table above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries in addition in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate as was the case in fiscal 2009 additional allowances may be required 

selfinsurance program 

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 2010 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 27 2009 measurement date increased 108 basis points to 802 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2010 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 27 2009 measurement date increased 11 basis points to 714 the combined effect of these discount rate changes decreased our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2010 by an estimated 386 million the discount rate for determining fiscal 2011 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the july 3 2010 measurement date decreased 187 basis points to 615 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2011 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the july 3 2010 measurement date decreased 79 basis points to 635 the combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2011 by an estimated 856 million a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2011 would decrease sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by 509 million while a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by 617 million the impact of a 100 basis point increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 100 basis point decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates therefore a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate 

we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels we used a plan specific agerelated set of rates for the retirement plan which are equivalent to a single rate of 530 as of july 3 2010 and 521 as of june 27 2009 for determining the benefit obligations as of july 3 2010 the serp calculations use an agegraded salary 

growth assumption as of june 27 2009 the serp calculations use an agegraded salary growth assumption with reductions taken for determining fiscal 2010 pay due to base salary freezes in effect for fiscal 2010 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 800 for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 71 25 18 and 195 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2009 respectively in addition in nine of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 100 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 800 for fiscal 2011 a 100 basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2011 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2011 by approximately 165 million 

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july 3 2010 was a charge net of tax of 5988 million the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 27 2009 was a charge net of tax of 3461 million 

changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions increased net companysponsored pension costs by approximately 374 million in fiscal 2010 changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to increase net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2011 by approximately 603 million 

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of 2979 million and 958 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively the contributions in fiscal 2010 of 2800 million to the retirement plan included the minimum required contribution for the calendar 2009 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements the contributions in fiscal 2009 of 800 million to the retirement plan were voluntary contributions we do not have a minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar 2010 plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements we contributed 1400 million to the retirement plan in fiscal 2010 for contributions that would normally have been made in fiscal 2011 additional contributions to the retirement plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal 2011 the estimated fiscal 2011 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan is approximately 222 million 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

vendor consideration 

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in some instances vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold our inventory turnover is usually less than one month therefore amounts deferred against inventory do not require longterm estimation in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized historically adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

in addition annually or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our eight operating segments as described in note 19 “business segment information” to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the components within each of our eight operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into eight reporting units 

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our eight operating segments the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements when possible we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in the fiscal 2010 analysis we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our lodging industry products reporting unit if the estimated fair value for this reporting unit had been 20 lower for the remainder of our reporting units we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 40 

the reporting units aggregated as “other” in the financial statement disclosures specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the broadline and sygma reporting units in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the broadline reporting units as such these “other” reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

sharebased compensation 

we provide compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plan and various nonemployee director plans 

as of july 3 2010 there was 662 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 276 years 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 

the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans with respect to years prior to fiscal 2009 was based on the stock price on the last day of the fiscal year less a 12 discount for postvesting restrictions the discount for postvesting restrictions was estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period the stock award component of the management incentive plan bonus awards was removed beginning in fiscal 2009 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 

the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan through fiscal 2008 was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus related the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period in those cases we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in other cases certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performancebased provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate in these cases if it is probable that the performance condition will be met we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the shorter performance period otherwise we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 

in addition certain of our sharebased awards provide that if the award holder retires at certain age and years of service thresholds the options continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director in these cases for awards granted prior to july 2 2005 our adoption date for the fair value recognition provisions in current stock compensation accounting standards we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires for awards granted subsequent to july 3 2005 we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business sales and expense trends anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expectations regarding share repurchases expected trends in fuel pricing usage costs and surcharges our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable our intention to lower our cost of goods sold by leveraging our purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an endtoend view of our 

supply chain expected implementation costs and benefits of the erp system our plan to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in international markets and complimentary lines of business the impact of ongoing legal proceedings the loss of sygma’s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of financing for them continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives anticipated companysponsored pension plan liabilities our expectations regarding cash flow from operations the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item 1a above and elsewhere in addition the success of sysco’s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control including actions by our competitors andor customers as implementation of the erp system and the business transformation project begins there may be changes in design or timing that impact nearterm expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required which could also impact project expense and timing companysponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time our plans with respect to growth in international markets and complimentary lines of business are subject to the company’s other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally legal proceedings are impacted by events circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated stock repurchases at historical levels or other unexpected cash requirements predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect as well the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect and laws and regulations as well as methods of enforcement are subject to change 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

fiscal 2010 

as of july 3 2010 we had no commercial paper outstanding our longterm debt obligations as of july 3 2010 were 25 billion of which approximately 81 were at fixed rates of interest including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 

in september 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2000 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2014 to floating rate debt 2014 swap in october 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted 2500 million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal 2013 to floating rate debt 2013 swap both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 

as of july 3 2010 the 2014 swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 55 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 46 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly as of july 3 2010 the 2013 swap was recognized as an asset within the 

consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of 55 million the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is 42 and the floating interest rate on the swap is threemonth libor which resets quarterly 

the following tables present our interest rate position as of july 3 2010 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

 

  

rate a — threemonth libor 

fiscal 2009 

as of june 27 2009 we had no commercial paper outstanding our longterm debt obligations as of june 27 2009 were 25 billion of which approximately 99 were at fixed rates of interest we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of june 27 2009 

the following table presents our interest rate position as of june 27 2009 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by 09 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and negatively impacted sales by 12 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2010 weighted yeartodate exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2010 sales by 02 and would not have materially impacted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our canadian financing subsidiary has the us dollar as its functional currency and has notes denominated in us dollars we have the potential to create taxable income in canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2010 yearend exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

fuel price risk 

due to the nature of our distribution business we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome purchases second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 06 08 and 07 of sales respectively fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges incurred by sysco decreased by approximately 718 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 and increased by 332 million in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 

from time to time we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of july 3 2010 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 930 million through september 2011 these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 30 to 35 of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel 

fuel costs in fiscal 2011 exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 10 million to 20 million as compared to fiscal 2010 our estimate is based upon current published quarterly market price projections for diesel the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2011 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential increase to 25 million to 35 million 

investment risk 

sysco invests in corporateowned life insurance policies in order to fund certain retirement programs which are subject to market risk the value of our investments in corporateowned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments which include publicly traded securities therefore the value of these policies will be adjusted each period based on the performance of the underlying securities which could result in volatility in our earnings should the financial markets decline we would take charges to adjust the carrying value of our corporateowned life insurance and if the market declines are significant these charges could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating expenses net income and earnings per share a 10 unfavorable change in publicly traded securities held within our investments in corporateowned life insurance would not have a material impact on our operating expenses net income and earnings per share 

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal yearend which is when this plan’s funded status is measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets specifically decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations to the extent the 

financial markets experience declines our anticipated future contributions pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plan at the plan’s fiscal year end december 31 2009 would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2011 however this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2011 by 316 million and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of july 3 2010 by 1027 million

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

 

 

 sales are less than 1 of total 

our operating companies distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended june 27 2009 

based upon available information we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers generally purchasing is carried out through centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies 

sysco’s baugh supply chain cooperative inc bscc administers a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in the cooperative’s programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through the cooperative’s programs 

sysco’s national supply chain group is focused on increasing profitability by lowering aggregate inventory levels operating costs and future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers one of the initiatives of this group is redistribution which involves the construction and operation of regional distribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region currently we have two rdcs in operation in virginia and florida and we have purchased the land for a third rdc in indiana 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of each customer’s credit worthiness we monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

corporate headquarters’ services 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance treasury cash management information technology employee benefits engineering risk management and insurance sales and marketing payroll human resources training and development information technology and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to construct and modernize our distribution facilities during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 approximately 464561000 515963000 and 603242000 respectively were invested in facility expansions fleet additions and other capital asset enhancements we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 should be in the range of 600000000 to 650000000 during the three years ended june 27 2009 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2010 capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

as of june 27 2009 we had approximately 47000 fulltime employees approximately 18 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 23 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which have expired or will expire during fiscal 2010 and are subject to renegotiation since june 27 2009 three contracts covering 440 of such employees have been renegotiated we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

competition 

sysco competes with numerous companies engaged in foodservice distribution our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets while we compete primarily with local and regional distributors a few companies compete with us on a national basis we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about 17 of this approximately 215 billion annual market we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the united states and canada “foodawayfromhome” industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2009 while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our diversified product base the diversity in the types of customers we serve our 

economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada which allows us to minimize the impact of regional economic declines we are the only publiclytraded distributor in the “foodawayfromhome” industry in the united states while our public company status provides us with some advantages including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

government regulation 

as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda as well as the canadian food and drugs act and the regulations thereunder 

the fda regulates food safety through various statutory and regulatory mandates including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations hazard analysis and critical control point haccp requirements for certain foods and the food and color additive approval process the agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels and regulates food contact packaging and materials for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda to interpret and implement these statutory provisions the usda imposes standards for product safety quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program the usda reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

in canada the canadian food inspection agency administers and enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards established by health canada under the canadian food and drugs act and under other related federal legislation including the canada agricultural products act the meat inspection act the fish inspection act and the consumer packaging and labeling act as it relates to food these laws regulate the processing storing grading packaging marking transporting and inspection of certain sysco product lines as well as the packaging labeling sale importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products 

we and our products are also subject to state provincial and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state provincial and local health agencies of state provincial and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor together with similar occupational health and safety laws in each canadian province these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

we are also subject to regulation by numerous us and canadian federal state provincial and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor and each canadian provincial ministry of labour which set employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation and the canadian transportation agency which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks other us and canadian federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

general 

we have numerous trademarks which are of significant importance to the company we believe that the loss of the syscor trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

as of june 27 2009 we operated 186 distribution facilities throughout the united states canada and ireland 




 item 1a risk factors 

deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets are affecting consumer confidence which is currently adversely impacting our business and we expect these conditions to continue 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins and the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions the deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets continue to negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending this has led to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home these conditions have in turn negatively impacted our sales as noted by our declining sequential sales trend each quarter from a positive 85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to a negative 66 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and have also negatively impacted our operating results for fiscal 2009 if these conditions do not improve there will continue to be a negative impact on our operating results 

increases in fuel costs and inflation affect our costs and we may not be able to compensate for increases in such costs 

volatile fuel prices and food costs have affected our industry during fiscal 2009 the cost of fuel affects the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel costs to our customers there is no guarantee that we can do so again if another period of high fuel costs occurs in addition prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on such product cost increases our estimate for the inflation in sysco’s cost of goods was 47 in fiscal 2009 compared to 60 in fiscal 2008 and 34 in fiscal 2007 if fuel costs and product costs increase again in the future we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs 

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third party suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us although our purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow and any default by us under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact 

because a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion our continued growth depends in large part on our ability to continue this expansion as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock 

product liability claims could materially impact our business 

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings 

maintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products anything that damages that reputation or the public’s confidence in our products whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of our products could quickly affect our revenues and profits reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively impact the public’s confidence in our products if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales and profitability would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns such as flu epidemics or other pandemics even those unrelated to the use of sysco products or public concern regarding the safety of our products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales and profitability to decrease dramatically 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages 

as of june 27 2009 approximately 8400 employees at 54 operating companies were members of 57 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2010 15 agreements covering approximately 1900 employees have expired or will expire since june 27 2009 three contracts covering 440 of the 1900 employees have been renegotiated failure of our operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings 

our operations rely heavily on our employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

our funding obligations with respect to our companysponsored qualified pension plan may increase should financial markets experience further declines 

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the returns on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability as a result of the decline in the financial markets in fiscal 2009 the value of the investments held by the retirement plan declined through june 27 2009 as compared to june 28 2008 these fluctuations in asset values have caused anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase have caused pension expense for fiscal 2010 to increase and have resulted in a reduction in our shareholders’ equity as of june 27 2009 which is when this plan’s funded status was last measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets specifically decreases in these interest rates may have an adverse impact on our results of operations to the extent financial markets experience further declines our future contributions pension expense and funded status may be negatively affected for future years which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans 

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 12 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2009 our total contributions to these plans which include payments for voluntary withdrawals were approximately 47982000 

we do not directly manage these multiemployer plans which are generally managed by boards of trustees half of whom are appointed by the unions and the other half by other contributing employers to the plan based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that several of these multiemployer plans are underfunded in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding as a result we expect our required contributions to these plans to increase in the future 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to 

make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the information currently available from plan administrators we estimate that our share of the aggregate withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans we participate in some of which appear to be underfunded could be as much as 80000000 as of june 27 2009 based on a voluntary withdrawal because the company is not provided with the information by plan administrators on a timely basis and the company expects that many multiemployer pension plans’ assets have declined due to recent financial market performance we believe our share of the withdrawal liability could be greater in addition if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements the internal revenue service irs may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5 on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund as of june 27 2009 we had approximately 17000000 in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal has already occurred all of which are expected to be paid during fiscal 2010 requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 

product cost deflation may adversely impact future operations 

our business may be adversely impacted by periods of prolonged product cost deflation we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses effectively 

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts and international operations may not be successful 

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes expansion of operations into new international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future sales and cash flows from our international operations 

our preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be viewed as beneficial to stockholders 

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred 

technology dependence could have a material negative impact on our business 

our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to generate and select orders to load and route trucks and to monitor and manage our business on a daytoday basis any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits 

our design of an enterprisewide software integration project may not be implemented and in the event of implementation may negatively impact our business results of operations and liquidity 

we commenced the design of an enterprisewide project to implement an integrated software system to support a majority of our business processes these systems are commonly referred to as enterprise resource planning erp systems when we have completed the design phase of this project which we anticipate to occur by the end of calendar 2009 a decision will be made as to whether to build the system as designed and if so the timing of implementation erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multiyear timeframe erp implementations typically require transformation of business and financial processes in order to realize the benefits of the project when the design phase is complete if we reach a decision to discontinue the project amounts invested will be written off which may negatively impact our results of operations at that time if we reach a decision to continue with the project our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems andor cost overages during the erp implementation process in addition because the implementation is expected to involve a significant capital commitment our business results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected if the erp system and the associated process changes do not result in the benefits that we anticipate

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

highlights 

we continued to experience a difficult economic environment in fiscal 2009 we believe the deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets have adversely impacted consumer disposable income and consumer spending patterns which in turn is impacting our industry our industry has experienced volatile fuel prices and food costs and our customers have experienced lower traffic from their customers food cost inflation which we began to experience at high levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and which prevailed through the first half of fiscal 2009 moderated in the second half of fiscal 2009 these factors negatively impacted sales and operating income in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 the decline in the financial markets had an additional impact on our operating income because sysco invests in life insurance policies in order to provide for certain retirement programs the value of our investments in corporateowned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments which include publicly traded securities due to the decline in the financial markets we have experienced losses in the cash surrender values of these policies which has reduced operating income 

sales decreased 18 in fiscal 2009 over the comparable prior year period to 36853330000 primarily due to deteriorating economic conditions and the resulting impact on consumer spending inflation as measured by product cost increases was an estimated 47 during fiscal 2009 operating income decreased to 1872211000 or 51 of sales a 04 decrease over the prior year our operating companies have continued to manage their businesses effectively in a difficult environment which is demonstrated by the fact that the decrease in operating income was less than the decrease in sales basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 were both 177 a decrease of 33 and 22 respectively from the comparable prior year period the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by accruals for tax contingencies and the nondeductibility of the losses recorded on corporateowned life insurance 

operating income for fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables the negative impact of these additional expenses was more than offset by lower payrelated expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies in addition our fuel costs increased in fiscal 2009 driven by higher contracted fuel prices as compared to fiscal 2008 we partially offset the impact of these higher fuel costs through fuel usage reduction measures and fuel surcharges 

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are primarily located throughout the united states canada and ireland and include broadline companies specialty produce companies customcut meat operations hotel supply operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 

we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about 17 of this approximately 215 billion annual market according to industry sources the foodservice or foodawayfromhome market represents approximately 48 of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states this share grew from about 37 in 1972 to nearly 50 in 1998 and did not change materially until 2008 when it declined to the current level of 48 

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately 36 in calendar year 2008 and real sales growth of 02 in calendar year 2007 real sales growth and declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income are contributing to a decline in the foodservice market historically we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry we intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth margin management productivity gains and supply chain management 

strategy 

we intend to continue to expand our market share and grow earnings through strategies which include 

 

we will continue to use our strategies to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy handle and market products for our customers our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in north america however we will continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities in other markets as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

 

sales 

sales for fiscal 2009 were 18 less than fiscal 2008 product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal 2009 estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were approximately 47 during fiscal 2009 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 12 compared to fiscal 2008 noncomparable acquisitions offset the rate of sales decline by 02 for fiscal 2009 

sales for fiscal 2008 were 71 greater than fiscal 2007 product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal 2008 estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were approximately 60 during fiscal 2008 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars increased sales by 10 compared to fiscal 2007 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 01 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008 

our sequential quarterly sales trend has demonstrated a continuing decline throughout fiscal 2008 and 2009 from a positive 85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to a negative 66 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we believe the deteriorating economic conditions which are placing pressure on consumer disposable income are contributing to a decline in real volume in the foodservice market and in turn have contributed to a reduction in our sales we believe we will continue to experience a difficult economic environment into fiscal 2010 thus far in fiscal 2010 we have experienced moderate deflation both of these conditions will make it challenging to grow sales in fiscal 2010 however if underlying economic conditions improve during fiscal 2010 we believe our trend of sequential quarterly sales decline may reverse 

we believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthening customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers we also believe these activities help our customers in this difficult economic environment 

operating income 

cost of sales primarily includes product costs net of vendor consideration and inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities 

operating income decreased 04 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 to 1872211000 or 51 of sales operating income declined primarily due to a decline in sales partially offset by a decline in operating expenses gross margin dollars decreased 22 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and operating expenses decreased 28 in fiscal 2009 

operating income increased 100 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 to 1879949000 or 50 of sales operating income increased primarily due to an increase in sales partially offset by an increase in operating expenses gross margin dollars increased 65 in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and operating expenses increased 53 in fiscal 2008 

beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 sysco began experiencing high levels of product cost increases in numerous product categories these increases persisted throughout fiscal 2008 at levels approximating 60 and rose even higher to 76 in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 the level of product cost increases began moderating during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and was 05 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 generally sysco attempts to pass increased costs to its customers however because of contractual and competitive reasons we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately prolonged periods of high inflation such as those we have recently experienced have a negative impact on our customers as high food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodpreparedawayfrom home market as a result these factors may negatively impact our sales gross margins and earnings we may also be negatively impacted by periods of prolonged product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

we believe the operating expense performance for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was aided by operating efficiencies and lower payroll expense related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation the positive impact of these expense reductions was partially offset by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables in addition our fuel costs increased during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

operating expenses in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 were negatively impacted by the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and increased provisions related to multiemployer pension plans the negative impact of these expense increases was partially offset by lower sharebased compensation expense and lower companysponsored pension expenses in addition our fuel costs increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 we increased our use of fuel surcharges to offset a portion of these increased costs thereby partially reducing the impact to operating income 

we adjust the carrying values of our corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments which include publicly traded securities as a result the cash surrender values of these policies will fluctuate with changes in the market value of such securities the performance in the financial markets resulted in losses for these policies of 43812000 in fiscal 2009 losses of 8718000 in fiscal 2008 and gains of 23922000 in fiscal 2007 the performance of the financial markets will continue to influence the cash surrender values of our corporateowned life insurance policies which could cause volatility in operating income net earnings and earnings per share 

the provision for losses on receivables included within operating expenses increased by 42454000 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 the current economic conditions and related decrease in consumer demand combined with tightening credit markets have impacted the liquidity of some of our customers resulting in an increase in delinquent payments on accounts receivable customer accounts written off net of recoveries were 71877000 or 020 of sales 32367000 or 009 of sales and 26010000 or 007 of sales for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in our provision for losses on receivables is related to customer accounts across our customer base without concentration in any specific location we continue to monitor our customer account balances and our credit policies and believe continued strong credit practices will be necessary to avoid significant increases in our provision for losses on receivables however if the difficult economic environment persists we expect to continue to experience higher levels of provision for losses on receivables and higher levels of writeoffs such as those experienced in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2010 

payrelated expenses decreased by 192086000 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 the reduction was due to a combination of reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation headcount declines occurred due to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions commensurate with lower sales the criteria for paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to overall company performance the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses for fiscal 2009 were not met therefore corporate executive officers will not receive bonuses for fiscal 2009 and operating company management bonuses are at lower levels for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

sysco’s fuel costs increased by 33154000 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices our fuel costs increased by 34023000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due to increased market diesel prices sysco’s costs per gallon increased 186 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and 187 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 sysco’s activities to manage increased fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 5000000 higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and 27000000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 usage of these surcharges was greater in the second half of fiscal 2008 and first half of fiscal 2009 due to sustained increased market diesel prices during that period fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins 

we periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements in fiscal 2009 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 68000000 of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2008 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 21000000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2007 the forward purchase commitments resulted in prices that were comparable to market prices 

as of june 27 2009 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 64000000 through march 2010 in july 2009 we entered additional forward purchase commitments totaling approximately 16000000 at a fixed price through june 2010 together these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 40 of our fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2010 our commitments through august 2009 were entered into at prevailing rates from midjuly through midaugust 2008 as a result these contracts are at fixed prices greater than both the prices incurred during same periods in the previous fiscal year and current market prices the remainder of our outstanding contracts were entered into at the prevailing rates in march april and july 2009 and thus the fixed price on these contracts reflects the lower current market price for diesel 

fuel costs in fiscal 2010 exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to decrease by approximately 50000000 to 80000000 as compared to fiscal 2009 our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in midaugust 2009 the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2010 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management however consistent with the lower current market price for diesel we expect fuel surcharge revenue to be significantly lower in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 declining by as much as 60000000 

sharebased compensation cost in fiscal 2009 was 24620000 less than in fiscal 2008 sharebased compensation expense decreased 17335000 in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 contributing to the decrease in both years was a reduction in the level of option grants being awarded compared to previous years resulting in reduced compensation expenses being recognized also affecting the decrease in fiscal 2009 was the removal of the previous stock award component from the management incentive plan annual bonus awards beginning with fiscal 2009 as a result the sharebased compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years was not incurred in fiscal 2009 and overall sharebased compensation expense was reduced as compared to the prior year beginning in fiscal 2010 we expect to replace the stock award component of the incentive bonuses with annual discretionary grants of restricted equity awards subject to timebased vesting sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2010 is expected to increase by 5000000 to 15000000 relative to fiscal 2009 due primarily to the anticipated discretionary grant of restricted awards in fiscal 2010 

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 were 22877000 higher than fiscal 2008 due primarily to the recognition of actuarial losses from lower returns on assets of sysco’s companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal 2008 and the merging of participants from a multiemployer pension plan the retirement plan see multiemployer pension plans at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations” partially offset by a decrease in expense due to an increase in the discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liabilities and amendments to our supplemental executive retirement plan serp net companysponsored pension costs decreased 8754000 in fiscal 2008 over the prior year due primarily to the funding status and the projected asset performance of the retirement plan at that time net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2010 are expected to increase by approximately 37000000 over fiscal 2009 due primarily to lower returns on assets of the retirement plan during fiscal 2009 partially offset by an increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal 2010 

we recorded provisions related to multiemployer pension plans of 9585000 in fiscal 2009 22284000 in fiscal 2008 and 4700000 in fiscal 2007 see additional discussion of multiemployer pension plans at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations” 

net earnings 

net earnings declined 45 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below as well as the factors discussed above net earnings increased 105 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due primarily to the factors discussed above as well as the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below 

the effective tax rate was 4037 in fiscal 2009 3825 in fiscal 2008 and 3825 in fiscal 2007 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted primarily by two factors first the company recorded tax adjustments related to federal and state tax contingencies of 31000000 second the loss of 43812000 which had a tax effect of 16824000 recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values was nondeductible for income tax purposes and had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the period the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances of 7800000 previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately 7700000 resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change 8600000 related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and 5500000 related to the reduction in net canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions sharebased compensation expense and the recognition of losses of 8718000 which had a tax effect of 3348000 recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was favorably impacted by the recognition of gains of 23922000 which had a tax effect of 9186000 recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was negatively impacted by the recognition of tax and interest for tax contingencies 

sysco’s affiliate baugh supply chain cooperative bscc is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments the internal revenue service irs in connection with its audits of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts sysco reached a settlement with the irs on august 21 2009 to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis pay the amounts currently recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a three year period and make a onetime payment of 41000000 of which approximately 39000000 is nondeductible the settlement addresses the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns and settles the matter for all subsequent periods including the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns already under audit we had previously accrued interest during the period of appeals and as a result of the settlement with the irs sysco will record an income tax benefit of approximately 30000000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased 33 and 22 respectively in fiscal 2009 from the prior year basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 130 and 131 respectively in fiscal 2008 over the prior year these changes were primarily the result of factors discussed above as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and an increase in the number of antidilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation 

as a result of the irs settlement noted above sysco will record an income tax benefit of approximately 30000000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect this to positively impact our diluted earnings per share by approximately 005 per share 

segment results 

we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 

management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results which include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins expenses or a combination thereof over the longterm each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment’s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment and intersegment sales expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales including intersegment sales and operating income respectively for purposes of this statistical table operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments of 219300000 in fiscal 2009 196726000 in fiscal 2008 and 207361000 in fiscal 2007 that are not charged to our segments this information should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

included in corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments among other items are 

 

broadline segment 

broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to customers broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2009 the broadline operating results represented approximately 79 of sysco’s overall sales and 94 of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment’s earnings 

sales 

sales for fiscal 2009 were 20 less than fiscal 2008 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 15 compared to fiscal 2008 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 02 to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2009 case volume declines attributable to the impact of the current business 

environment caused a decline in sales in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 product cost inflation which led to increases in selling prices partially offset case volume declines in fiscal 2009

sales for fiscal 2008 were 81 greater than fiscal 2007 the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars increased sales by 13 compared to fiscal 2007 noncomparable acquisitions did not have a material impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008 product cost inflation and the resulting increases in selling prices was the primary contributor to sales growth in addition fiscal 2008 growth was realized both from increased sales to multiunit customers and marketing associateserved customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the efforts of our marketing associates and the use of business reviews with customers 

operating income 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 was primarily due to effective management of operations in the current economic environment effective management was also evidenced by margins declining at a lower rate than our sales decline and by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods gross margin dollars decreased 17 while operating expenses decreased 32 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 expense performance for fiscal 2009 was aided by lower payrollrelated expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on receivables 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses we were able to manage our business effectively in the inflationary environment that existed in fiscal 2008 by managing margins and improving operating efficiencies gross margin dollars increased 70 while operating expenses increased 60 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 

the high cost of fuel also impacted our broadline segment’s results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 fuel costs were 28818000 higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 fuel costs for fiscal 2008 were 21575000 higher than fiscal 2007 we attempt to mitigate increased fuel costs by reducing miles driven improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges in the second half of fiscal 2008 and first half of fiscal 2009 our usage of fuel surcharges increased due to sustained increased market diesel prices fuel surcharges were approximately 9000000 higher in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 and 21000000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 consistent with the lower current market price for diesel we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our broadline segment to be lower in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

we recorded provisions related to multiemployer pension plans of 9585000 in fiscal 2009 22284000 in fiscal 2008 and 4700000 in fiscal 2007 

sygma segment 

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

sales 

sales for fiscal 2009 were 58 greater than fiscal 2008 and 44 greater in fiscal 2008 than fiscal 2007 although our sygma segment has been negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions it achieved sales growth in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 primarily due to significant contracts with new customers and product cost increases which led to increases in selling prices these increases were partially offset by lost sales due to the elimination of unprofitable business and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting sygma’s existing customer base 

one chain restaurant customer wendy’sarby’s group inc accounted for approximately 33 of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended june 27 2009 sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

operating income 

operating income increased in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 gross margin dollars increased 04 while operating expenses decreased 51 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions 

operating income in fiscal 2008 decreased as compared to fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 sygma expensed 5587000 related to the writeoff of software development costs in addition some of sygma’s customers experienced a slowdown in their business resulting in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop expense reductions were accomplished by consolidating regional offices reducing headcounts and not renewing unprofitable customer contracts 

the high cost of fuel also impacted our sygma segment’s results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 fuel costs were 2028000 higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 fuel costs for fiscal 2008 were 8888000 higher than fiscal 2007 sygma was able to partially offset these costs through increases in the fees charged to customers including fuel surcharges and by reducing expenses fuel surcharges were approximately 5000000 lower in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 and 6000000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 consistent with the lower current market price for diesel we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment to be lower in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

other segment 

 “other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce customcut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 

on an aggregate basis our “other” segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry these operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in fiscal 2009 in the aggregate the “other” segment represented approximately 88 of sysco’s overall sales and 49 of the aggregate operating income of sysco’s segments which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

operating income decreased 258 for fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 the decrease in operating income was caused primarily by reduced sales in all segments attributable to the deteriorating economic environment 

operating income increased 30 for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the increase in operating income was generated primarily by improved results in the specialty produce and the lodging industry segments offset by reduced sales and operating income in the customcut meat segment 

liquidity and capital resources 

sysco’s strategic objectives require continuing investment our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements investments in facilities systems fleet and other equipment cash dividends and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy in addition this cash will be used to satisfy the requirements of the irs settlement over the next three years any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in highquality shortterm instruments or applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure these transactions may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

we believe that our cash flows from operations the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes during the recent tightening of the credit markets we have continued to maintain the highest credit rating available for commercial paper we believe that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper market effectively we also issued longterm senior notes totaling 500000000 under our shelf registration statement during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 in order to take advantage of the interest rates available to us at that time and to enhance our liquidity position we believe that we will continue to be able to access the longterm capital market effectively 

operating activities 

we generated 1582341000 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009 1596129000 in fiscal 2008 and 1402922000 in fiscal 2007 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to net income reduced by decreases in accounts payable balances and accrued expenses offset by decreases in accounts receivable balances and inventory balances and an increase in accrued income taxes cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to net income reduced by decreases in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable balances and inventory balances partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to net 

income reduced by decreases in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable balances inventory balances and prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable balances

the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the sales decline the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were primarily due to sales growth the decrease in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily from inventory decreases resulting from the sales decline the increases in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were primarily due to inventory increases resulting from sales growth accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors including changes in product mix cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 

cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by decreases in accrued expenses of 120314000 during fiscal 2009 and 22721000 during fiscal 2008 and positively impacted by an increase in accrued expenses of 132936000 during fiscal 2007 the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive bonuses offset by lower accruals for current year incentive bonuses the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixedrate debt issued in fiscal 2008 and an increase to a provision related to a multiemployer pension plan see additional discussion of multiemployer pension plans at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations” the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased accruals for fiscal 2007 incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over fiscal 2006 

in fiscal 2007 we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of 50296000 and the corresponding insurance receivable of 48296000 included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal 2008 these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment in excess of our deductible see further discussion of the product liability claim under note 19 commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net decreased 48380000 during fiscal 2009 increased 13459000 during fiscal 2008 and decreased 14817000 in fiscal 2007 the decrease in fiscal 2009 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax benefits see additional discussion of an irs settlement at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations” the decrease was partially offset by a combination of the recording of net companysponsored pension costs and incentive compensation deferrals the increase for fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to a combination of the recording of net companysponsored pension costs incentive compensation deferrals and a net increase to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits partially offset by pension contributions to our companysponsored plans the decrease in fiscal 2007 was due to pension contributions to our companysponsored plans exceeding the amount of net companysponsored pension costs recognized during the year we recorded net companysponsored pension costs of 88714000 65837000 and 74591000 during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively our contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit plans were 95776000 92670000 and 91163000 during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively we expect to contribute approximately 160000000 to our companysponsored defined benefit plans in fiscal 2010 

investing activities 

fiscal 2009 capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included 

 

fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included 

 

 

we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 to be in the range of 600000000 to 650000000 fiscal 2010 expenditures will include the continuation of the foldout program facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions and investments in technology 

during fiscal 2009 in the aggregate the company paid cash of 218075000 for operations acquired during fiscal 2009 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years during fiscal 2009 we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in ireland los angeles california and boston massachusetts as well as a produce distributor in toronto ontario 

financing activities 

equity 

we traditionally have engaged in boardapproved share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 16951200 shares for 438843000 in fiscal 2009 16769900 shares for 529179000 in fiscal 2008 and 16231200 shares for 550865000 in fiscal 2007 as of august 12 2009 there was a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 9386600 shares we expect to repurchase significantly fewer shares in fiscal 2010 than in previous years 

dividends paid were 548246000 or 092 per share in fiscal 2009 497467000 or 082 per share in fiscal 2008 and 445416000 or 072 per share in fiscal 2007 in may 2009 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 of 024 per share which was paid in july 2009 

in november 2000 we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 12 2009 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement

the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of february 2008 

in february 2009 we deregistered the securities remaining unsold under our then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the sec in february 2008 for the issuance of debt securities in february 2009 sysco filed with the sec an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities that may be issued from time to time

total debt 

total debt as of june 27 2009 was 2476649000 of which approximately 99 was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 56 and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 13 certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders including provisions to maintain our longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of june 27 2009 

other 

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements as of june 27 2009 and june 28 2008 letters of credit outstanding were 74679000 and 35785000 respectively 

other considerations 

multiemployer pension plans 

as discussed in note 19 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the most recent information available from plan administrators our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans we participate in some of which appear to be underfunded was estimated to be 80000000 as of june 27 2009 based on a voluntary withdrawal because we are not provided the information by the plan administrators on a timely basis and we expect that many multiemployer pension plans’ assets have declined due to recent stock market performance we believe our share of the withdrawal liability could be greater 

required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations borrowing capacity or a combination of these items as of june 27 2009 we have approximately 17000000 in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multiemployer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal has already occurred all of which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2010 

during fiscal 2008 we obtained information that a multiemployer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded that it was probable that additional funding would be required as well as the payment of excise tax as a result during fiscal 2008 we recorded a liability of approximately 16500000 related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we effectively withdrew from this multiemployer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits for our employees that were participants in the plan and to manage our exposure to this underfunded plan we agreed to pay 15000000 to the plan which included the minimum funding requirements in connection with this withdrawal agreement we merged active participants from this plan into sysco’s companysponsored retirement plan and assumed 26704000 in liabilities the payment to the plan was made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 if this plan were to undergo a mass 

withdrawal as defined by the pension benefit guaranty corporation prior to september 2010 we could have additional liability we do not currently believe a mass withdrawal from this plan prior to september 2010 is probable 

we have experienced other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans withdrawal liabilities incurred include 9585000 in fiscal 2009 5784000 in fiscal 2008 and 4700000 in fiscal 2007 

bscc cooperative structure 

sysco’s affiliate baugh supply chain cooperative bscc is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments the irs in connection with its audits of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts sysco reached a settlement with the irs on august 21 2009 to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis pay the amounts currently recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a three year period and make a onetime payment of 41000000 of which approximately 39000000 is nondeductible the settlement addresses the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns and settles the matter for all subsequent periods including the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns already under audit as a result of the settlement we will pay the amounts owed in the following schedule 

 

of the amounts to be paid in fiscal 2010 included in the table above 316000000 will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the remaining payments will be paid in quarterly installments beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 amounts to be paid in fiscal 2011 and 2012 will be paid with sysco’s quarterly tax payments we believe we have access to sufficient cash on hand cash flows from operations and current access to capital to make payments on all of the amounts noted above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth as of june 27 2009 certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

 

 

 26 

 certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 27 2009 included 78250000 in cash this amount is not included in the table above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration goodwill and intangible assets and sharebased compensation 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries in addition in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate as was the case in fiscal 2009 additional allowances may be required 

selfinsurance program 

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

companysponsored pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 28 2008 measurement date increased 016 to 694 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 28 2008 measurement date increased 039 to 703 the combined effect of these discount rate changes was a decrease in our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2009 by an estimated 8692000 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2010 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 27 2009 measurement date increased 108 to 802 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2010 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 27 2009 measurement date increased 011 to 714 the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2010 by an estimated 38600000 a 10 increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2010 would decrease sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by 34100000 while a 10 decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by 40000000 the impact of a 10 increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 10 decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates therefore a 10 increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a 10 decrease in the discount rate as of june 27 2009 our net actuarial losses from our companysponsored pension plans were 534892000 an increase of 183688000 we estimate the amortization of net actuarial losses will increase our fiscal 2010 pension expense by approximately 23000000 as compared to fiscal 2009 

we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels we used a plan specific agerelated set of rates for the retirement plan which are equivalent to a single rate of 521 as of june 27 2009 and 617 as of june 28 2008 for determining the benefit obligations as of june 27 2009 the serp calculations use an agegraded salary growth assumption with reductions taken for determining fiscal 2010 pay due to base salary freezes in effect for fiscal 2010 as of june 28 2008 the serp assumes various levels of base salary increase and decrease for determining pay for fiscal 2009 depending upon the participant’s position with the company and a 7 salary growth assumption for all participants for fiscal 2010 and thereafter 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 800 for fiscal 2009 and 850 for fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumption was changed to a net return on assets assumption which contributed to the 050 decrease in the assumption to 800 in fiscal 2009 prior to fiscal 2009 this assumption represented gross return on assets and plan expenses were reflected within service cost the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on longterm bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 74 20 05 and 294 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2008 respectively in addition in eight of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 100 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 800 for fiscal 2010 a 10 increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2010 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2010 by approximately 13100000 

pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june 28 2008 was a charge net of tax of 220913000 which 

represented the net actuarial losses prior service costs and transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of previous pension accounting standards as of that date the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 27 2009 was a charge net of tax of 346107000 

changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions increased net companysponsored pension costs by approximately 25800000 in fiscal 2009 increasing the net companysponsored pension costs by approximately 4300000 in fiscal 2009 were additional costs related to the merger of participants from a multiemployer pension plan into sysco’s companysponsored retirement plan see multiemployer pension plans under other considerations for further discussion decreasing the net companysponsored pension costs by approximately 7200000 in fiscal 2009 was a change in the serp design the net impact of all of these changes was a net increase in fiscal 2009 in companysponsored pension costs of 22877000 changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to increase net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2010 by approximately 37000000 

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of 95776000 and 92670000 in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of 80000000 and 80000000 in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively our minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar 2009 plan year is estimated at 95000000 to meet erisa minimum funding requirements sysco will be required to pay quarterly contributions for the calendar 2010 plan year the first installment of which must be made in fiscal 2010 we anticipate we will make 140000000 of contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal 2010 the estimated fiscal 2010 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other postretirement plans together are approximately 19817000 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as foreign jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

prior to fiscal 2008 in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions we established an accrual when despite our belief that our tax return positions were supportable we believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss was probable when facts and circumstances changed these accruals were adjusted beginning in fiscal 2008 we adopted a new accounting standard which changed our accounting for uncertain tax positions this accounting standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position must be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement see discussion under note 17 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

vendor consideration 

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized in certain of these latter instances the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco in these cases we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognize these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

in addition annually or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our six operating segments as described in note 20 business segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units 

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our six operating segments the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 

actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles recorded in fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in fiscal 2009 the reporting units’ fair values would have had to have been lower by 16 compared to the fair values estimated in our impairment analysis before additional analysis would have been indicated to determine if an impairment existed for any of our reporting units 

the other specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products and international distribution operations operating segments have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the broadline and sygma segments in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the broadline segment as such these other operating segments have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

sharebased compensation 

we provide compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plan and various nonemployee director plans 

as of june 27 2009 there was 63746000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 297 years 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a postvesting restriction the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans with respect to years prior to fiscal 2009 was based on the stock price on the last day of the fiscal year less a 12 discount for postvesting restrictions the discount for postvesting restrictions was estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period the stock award component of the management incentive plan bonus awards was removed beginning in fiscal 2009 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 

the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan through fiscal 2008 was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus related the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period in those cases we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in other cases certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performancebased provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate in these cases if it is probable that the performance condition will be met we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the shorter performance period otherwise we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 

in addition certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee or director in these cases for awards granted prior to july 2 2005 our adoption date for the fair value recognition provisions in current stock compensation accounting standards we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires for awards granted subsequent to july 3 2005 we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

accounting changes 

sfas 165 adoption 

in may 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 165 “subsequent events”  sfas 165 which establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued specifically the standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date this standard became effective for sysco for its fiscal year ending june 27 2009 we have included the required disclosures for this standard in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

sfas 161 adoption 

as of the third quarter of fiscal 2009 sfas no 161 “disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133” sfas 161 became effective for sysco sfas 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting the company has determined that no additional disclosures were necessary upon adoption but will continue to assess the need for additional disclosures in future periods 

sfas 157 adoption 

as of june 29 2008 sysco adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 157 “ fair value measurements” sfas 157 for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis sfas 157 establishes a common definition for fair value under generally accepted accounting principles establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements the adoption of sfas 157 for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis did not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements see also the discussion of fasb staff position 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” under new accounting standards below 

fin 48 adoption 

as of july 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas 109 fin 48 clarifies the application of sfas 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements additionally fin 48 provides guidance on the measurement derecognition classification and disclosure of tax positions along with accounting for the related interest and penalties as a result of this adoption we recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle a 91635000 decrease in our beginning retained earnings on our july 1 2007 balance sheet 

sfas 158 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 sfas 158 has two major provisions the recognition and disclosure provision and the measurement date provision we previously adopted sfas 158’s recognition and disclosure requirements as of june 30 2007 the measurement date provision requires an employer to measure a plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year we elected to early adopt the measurement date provision as of june 30 2007 in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time as a result beginning in fiscal 2008 the measurement date for all plans returned to correspond with fiscal yearend we performed measurements as of may 31 2007 and june 30 2007 of the plan assets and benefit obligations we recorded a charge to beginning retained earnings on july 1 2007 of 3572000 net of tax for the impact of the difference in our companysponsored pension expense between the two measurement dates we also recorded a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive income loss on july 1 2007 of 22780000 net of tax for the impact of the difference in the recognition provision between the two measurement dates 

new accounting standards 

sfas 141r 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas 141r which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in a business combination this statement also establishes recognition and measurement principles for the goodwill acquired in a business combination and disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination we will apply this statement primarily on a prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal 2010 earlier application of the standard was prohibited

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business sales and expense trends anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans the estimated impact of the irs settlement the impact of ongoing legal proceedings the loss of sygma’s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position anticipated capital expenditures and the sources of financing for those capital expenditures continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives anticipated companysponsored pension plan liabilities the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item 1a above and elsewhere in addition the success of sysco’s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs companysponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets legal proceedings are impacted by events circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated stock repurchases at historical levels or other unexpected cash requirements the diluted earnings per share impact of the settlement is impacted by share repurchases and the number of antidilutive stock options excluded from the diluted shares calculation the diluted earnings per share impact of the irs settlement is impacted by share repurchases and the number of antidilutive stock options excluded from the diluted shares calculation predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect as well the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect and laws and regulations as well as methods of enforcement are subject to change

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

fiscal 2009 

as of june 27 2009 we had no commercial paper outstanding our longterm debt obligations as of june 27 2009 were 2476649000 of which approximately 99 were at fixed rates of interest we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of june 27 2009 

the following table presents our interest rate position as of june 27 2009 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

fiscal 2008 

as of june 28 2008 we had no commercial paper outstanding our longterm debt obligations as of june 28 2008 were 1980331000 of which approximately 99 were at fixed rates of interest we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of june 28 2008 

the following table presents our interest rate position as of june 28 2008 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders’ equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements 

of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by 12 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and increased sales 10 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the impact to our operating income net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2009 yearend exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal 2009 sales by an additional 08 and would not have materially impacted our operating income net earnings and earnings per share we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 

our canadian financing subsidiary has the us dollar as its functional currency and has notes denominated in us dollars we have the potential to create taxable income in canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2009 yearend exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

fuel price risk 

the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 08 07 and 06 of sales respectively fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges incurred by sysco increased by approximately 33154000 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and 34023000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 

from time to time we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 27 2009 we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately 64000000 through march 2010 in july 2009 we entered additional forward purchase commitments totaling approximately 16000000 at a fixed price through june 2010 together these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 40 of our fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2010 our commitments through august 2009 were entered into at prevailing rates from midjuly through midaugust 2008 as a result these contracts are at fixed prices greater than both the prices incurred during same periods in the previous fiscal year and current market prices the remainder of our outstanding contracts were entered into at the prevailing rates in march april and july 2009 and thus the fixed price on these contracts reflects the lower current market price for diesel 

fuel costs in fiscal 2010 exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to decrease by approximately 50000000 to 80000000 as compared to fiscal 2009 our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in midaugust 2009 the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2010 and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates a 10 unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential decrease to 40000000 to 70000000 

investment risk 

sysco invests in corporateowned life insurance policies in order to fund certain retirement programs which are subject to market risk the value of our investments in corporateowned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments which include publicly traded securities therefore the value of these policies will be adjusted each period based on the performance of the underlying securities which could result in volatility in our earnings due to the declines in the financial markets in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 we have experienced significant losses in adjusting the carrying value of these policies to their cash surrender values in these periods should the financial markets decline we would take charges to adjust the carrying value of our corporateowned life insurance and if the market declines are significant these charges could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating expenses net income and earnings per share a 10 unfavorable change in publicly traded securities held within our investments in corporateowned life insurance would not have a material impact on our operating expenses net income and earnings per share 

our companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon among other things the return on the plan’s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan’s liability as a result of the declines in the financial markets in fiscal 2009 the value of the investments held by the retirement plan declined as of june 27 2009 as compared to june 28 2008 these fluctuations in asset values have caused the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase have caused pension expense for fiscal 2010 to increase and have resulted in a reduction to shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 27 2009 which is when this plan’s funded status was last measured also the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets specifically decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations to the extent the financial markets experience further 

declines our anticipated future contributions pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years as well a 10 unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our companysponsored retirement plan at the plan’s fiscal year end december 31 2008 would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal 2010 however this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal 2010 by 23700000 and would reduce our shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet as of june 27 2009 by 76630000

operating segments 

 

sysco provides food and related products to the foodservice or “foodpreparedawayfromhome” industry under the provisions of sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” sfas 131 we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in sfas 131 broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both our traditional and chain restaurant customers sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to chain restaurant customer locations “other” financial information is attributable to our other segments including our specialty produce customcut meat and lodging industry products segments and a company that distributes to international customers specialty produce companies distribute fresh produce and on a limited basis other foodservice products specialty meat companies distribute customcut fresh steaks other meat seafood and poultry our lodging industry products company distributes personal care guest amenities equipment housekeeping supplies room accessories and textiles to the lodging industry selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in note 19 business segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

customers and products 

 

the foodservice industry consists of two major customer types — “traditional” and “chain restaurant” traditional foodservice customers include restaurants hospitals schools hotels and industrial caterers our chain restaurant customers include regional and national hamburger sandwich pizza chicken steak ethnic and other chain operations 

 

services to our traditional foodservice and chain restaurant customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

 

the products we distribute include 

  

we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

 1 

 

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

 

 

 

  

our operating companies distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of products to traditional customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through our more than 14000 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total sales for the fiscal year ended june 28 2008 

 

our sales to chain restaurant customers consist of a variety of food products we believe that consistent product quality and timely and accurate service are important factors when a chain restaurant selects a foodservice supplier one chain restaurant customer wendy’s international inc accounted for 5 of our sales for the fiscal year ended june 28 2008 although this customer represents approximately 34 of the sygma segment sales we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

 

based upon available information we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 

 

sources of supply 

 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers both domestic and international none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers generally purchasing is carried out through centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies we continually develop relationships with our suppliers 

 

sysco’s baugh supply chain cooperative inc bscc administers a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines sysco’s operating companies purchase product from the suppliers participating in the cooperative’s programs and from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through the cooperative’s programs 

 

sysco’s national supply chain group is focused on increasing profitability by lowering aggregate inventory levels operating costs and future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

 

the national supply chain group has three major supply chain initiatives the first initiative involves the construction and operation of regional distribution centers which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region we currently expect to build five to seven redistribution centers rdcs the first of these centers the northeast rdc located in front royal virginia has been operational since the third quarter of fiscal 2005 a second rdc located in alachua florida became operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009 we intend to service additional broadline companies from our existing rdcs the 

second initiative is the national transportation management initiative which provides the capability to view and manage all of sysco’s inbound freight both to rdcs and the operating companies as a network and not as individual locations this allows us to better consolidate inbound freight fiscal 2008 was the first full year we operated under this initiative and we will continue to refine our execution in the future the third initiative is the national implementation of demand planning and inventory management software this initiative is strategically important in that it creates the foundation to effectively execute new supply chain processes including redistribution as well as efficiently manage our inventory assets in fiscal 2008 we continued to improve this software and implemented it at additional broadline companies 

 

working capital practices 

 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

 

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of the customers’ credit risk we monitor the customers’ accounts and will suspend shipments to customers if necessary 

 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when the customers’ orders are placed we generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

 

corporate headquarters’ services 

 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance treasury cash management information technology employee benefits engineering risk management and insurance sales and marketing payroll human resources training and development information technology and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in operational best practices including space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

 

capital improvements 

 

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to construct and modernize our distribution facilities during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 approximately 515963000 603242000 and 513934000 respectively were invested in facility expansions fleet additions and other capital asset enhancements the lower amount spent in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to delays on certain projects that will shift significant expenditures to fiscal 2009 as a result we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 should be in the range of 675000000 to 725000000 during the three years ended june 28 2008 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2009 capital expenditures from the same sources 

 

employees 

 

as of june 28 2008 we had approximately 50000 fulltime employees approximately 17 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 21 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which have expired or will expire during fiscal 2009 we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

 

competition 

 

sysco’s business environment is competitive with numerous companies engaged in foodservice distribution our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets while competition is encountered primarily from local and regional distributors a few companies compete with us on a national basis we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices we estimate that we serve about 16 of an approximately 231 billion annual market that includes the foodservice market in the united states and canada and the hotel amenity furniture and textile markets in the united states canada europe and asia we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the united states and canada “foodpreparedawayfromhome” industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2008 while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas we believe our competitive advantages include our diversified product base the diversity in the types of customers we serve our economies of scale and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada which allows us to minimize the impact of regional economic declines we are the only publiclytraded distributor in the “foodpreparedawayfromhome” industry in the united states while our public company status provides us with some advantages including access to capital we believe it also provides us with some disadvantages that our competitors do not have in terms of additional costs related to complying with regulatory requirements 

government regulation 

 

as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to a number of statutes governing the manufacture storage transport and sale of food products in the united states and canada the principal statutes are the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda as well as the canadian food and drugs act and the regulations thereunder 

 

the fda regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through its manufacturing practice regulations specifies the standards of identity for certain foods and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us department of agriculture usda the usda imposes standards for product quality and sanitation including the inspection and labeling of meat and poultry products and the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the federal trade commission act which governs food advertising and the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 and the regulations promulgated thereunder which establish certain registration import notification and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

 

in canada the canadian food inspection agency administers and enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards established by health canada under the canadian food and drugs act and under other related federal legislation including the canada agricultural products act the meat inspection act the fish inspection act and the consumer packaging and labeling act as it relates to food these laws regulate the processing storing grading packaging marking transporting and inspection of certain sysco product lines as well as the packaging labeling sale importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products 

 

we and our products are also subject to state provincial and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state provincial and local health agencies of state provincial and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections by fda and usda as well as inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor together with similar occupational health and safety laws in each canadian province these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

 

we are also subject to regulation by numerous us and canadian federal state provincial and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us equal employment opportunity commission the us department of labor and each canadian provincial ministry of labour which set employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation and the canadian transportation agency which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

 

most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks as well as laws regulating the handling and release of these substances our facilities also have large areas of impermeable surface for parking and staging of vehicles and therefore are potentially subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations covering storm water runoff other us and canadian federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

 

compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

 

general 

 

we have numerous trademarks which are of significant importance to the company we believe that the loss of the syscor trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

 

as of june 28 2008 we operated 180 distribution facilities throughout the united states and canada 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

increased fuel costs and increased inflation have increased our costs and we may not be able to compensate for such increased costs 

 

increased fuel costs have had a negative impact on our fiscal 2008 results of operations the high cost of fuel has increased the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers although we have been able to pass along a portion of our increased fuel costs to our customers there is no guarantee that we can continue to do so in addition prolonged periods of product cost inflation may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on such product cost increases our estimate for the inflation in sysco’s cost of goods was 60 in fiscal 2008 compared to 34 in fiscal 2007 and 06 in fiscal 2006 if fuel costs and product costs continue to increase we may experience difficulties in passing all or a portion of these costs along to our customers which may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability 

 

inflation rising fuel costs and other economic conditions are affecting consumer confidence which is currently adversely impacting our business and we currently expect these conditions to continue into fiscal 2009 

 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins and the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions inflation increases in fuel costs and other general economic conditions have negatively affected consumer confidence and discretionary spending in fiscal 2008 this has led to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and can also result in reduction of sales volumes competitive price pressures difficulties in collecting accounts receivable increases in our product costs and increases in delivery costs these conditions have in turn negatively impacted our sales as noted by declining rate of sales growth from 85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to 54 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and have also negatively impacted our operating results for fiscal 2008 these conditions are expected to continue to negatively impact our results for the foreseeable future 

 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs 

 

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third party suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us although our purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to foodborne illnesses in the united states and canada our inability to obtain adequate supplies of our foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

 

taxing authorities may successfully challenge our baugh supply chain cooperative structure 

 

the baugh supply chain cooperative bscc administers a consolidated product procurement program to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products bscc is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code we believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of bscc are appropriate under the tax laws however if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of bscc were to be successfully challenged by any federal state or local tax authority we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with bscc that we otherwise had deferred until future periods in that event we would be liable for interest on such amounts as of june 28 2008 we have recorded deferred income tax liabilities of 1054190000 related to the bscc supply chain distributions this amount represents the income tax liabilities related to bscc that were accrued but the payment had been deferred as of june 28 2008 in addition if the irs or any other taxing authority determines that all amounts since the inception of bscc were inappropriately deferred or that bscc should have been a taxable entity we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred as discussed above we may have additional liability representing interest that would be payable on the cumulative deferred balances ranging from 290000000 to 320000000 prior to federal and state income tax benefit as of june 28 2008 we calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of bscc applying the applicable jurisdictions’ interest rates in effect each period the irs in connection with its audit of our 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments related to the taxability of the cooperative structure we are vigorously protesting these adjustments we have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the irs and concluded the measurement model of fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” required us to provide an accrual for a portion of the interest exposure if a taxing authority requires us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest if any we may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may have to forego share repurchases or defer planned capital expenditures or a combination of these items 

 

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow but our leveraged position could increase our vulnerability to competitive pressures 

 

because a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion our continued growth depends in large part on our ability to continue this expansion as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds 

could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock further our leveraged position may also increase our vulnerability to competitive pressures 

 

product liability claims could materially impact our business 

 

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

 

adverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings 

 

maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products anything that damages that reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of our products could quickly affect our revenues and profits reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales to decrease dramatically 

 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages 

 

as of june 28 2008 approximately 8700 employees at 54 operating companies were members of 57 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2009 14 agreements covering approximately 1900 employees have expired or will expire failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings 

 

our operations rely heavily on our employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans 

 

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 12 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2008 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 35040000 

 

we do not directly manage these multiemployer plans which are generally managed by boards of trustees half of whom are appointed by the unions and the other half by other contributing employers to the plan based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that some of these multiemployer plans are underfunded due partially to a decline in the value of the assets supporting these plans a reduction in the number of actively participating members for whom employer contributions are required and the level of benefits provided by the plans in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding as a result our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future 

 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the information available from plan administrators we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans we participate in some of which appear to be underfunded could be as much as 140000000 of which only approximately 22000000 has been accrued as of june 28 2008 in addition if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements the irs may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5 on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 

product cost deflation may also adversely impact future operations 

 

although we are currently experiencing a period of product cost inflation our business may also be adversely impacted by periods of prolonged product cost deflation we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 

 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses wisely 

 

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited or no expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

 

expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts and international operations may not be successful 

 

in addition to our domestic activities an element of our strategy includes expansion of operations into new international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

 

our preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be beneficial to stockholders 

 

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred 

 

technology dependence could have a material negative impact on our business 

 

our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems among other things to load trucks in the most efficient manner to optimize the use of storage space and minimize the time spent at each stop any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

highlights 

 

sales increased 71 in fiscal 2008 over the prior year product costs increased an estimated 60 during fiscal 2008 over the prior year operating income increased to 1879949000 and 50 of sales a 100 increase over the prior year net earnings and diluted earnings per share increased 105 and 131 respectively over the prior year 

 

fiscal 2008 provided a challenging economic environment our industry is experiencing various macroeconomic pressures including high fuel costs rising food prices and general economic conditions which are pressuring consumer disposable income these factors restricted growth in fiscal 2008 and are continuing into fiscal 2009 high food cost inflation which we began to experience in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 prevailed throughout fiscal 2008 in spite of these conditions our operating companies managed margins and expenses effectively gross profit dollars increased 65 in fiscal 2008 while operating expenses grew only 53 over the prior year 

 

operating income was negatively impacted by additional expenses from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values as compared to gains in fiscal 2007 and increased provisions related to multiemployer pension plans the negative impact of these additional expenses was partially offset by lower sharebased compensation expense and lower companysponsored pension expenses in addition fuel costs increased in fiscal 2008 driven by higher fuel prices we partially offset the impact of the higher fuel costs through fuel usage reduction measures as well as fuel surcharges we expect fuel costs in fiscal 2009 to be greater than in fiscal 2008 

 

overview 

 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies specialty produce companies customcut meat operations hotel supply operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 

 

we estimate that we serve about 16 of an approximately 231 billion annual market this market includes i the foodservice market in the united states and canada and ii the hotel amenity and hotel furniture and textile market in the united states canada europe and asia according to industry sources the foodservice or foodpreparedawayfromhome market represents approximately onehalf of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level this share grew from about 37 in 1972 to about 50 in 1998 and has not changed materially since that time 

 

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 13 in calendar year 2007 and 19 in calendar year 2006 

 

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodpreparedawayfromhome and in turn can impact our customers and our sales we believe the current general economic conditions including pressure on consumer disposable income are contributing to a decline in the foodservice market historically we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry we intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth margin management productivity gains and supply chain management 

 

strategic business initiatives 

 

sysco maintains strategic focus areas which aim to help us achieve our longterm vision of becoming the global leader of the efficient multitemperature food product value chain the following areas generally comprise the initiatives that are currently serving as the foundation of our efforts to ensure a sustainable future 

 

  

a major component of our national supply chain is the use of redistribution centers rdcs the first rdc the northeast rdc located in front royal virginia opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 construction of our second rdc in alachua florida was completed in fiscal 2008 and 

operations to service our five broadline operating companies in florida began in april 2008 in fiscal 2009 we intend to service additional broadline companies from our existing rdcs 

 

we will continue to use our strategic business initiatives to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy handle and market products for our customers our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in north america however we will also continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities and stay abreast of international acquisition opportunities 

 

as a part of our on going strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 

 

accounting changes 

 

fin 48 adoption 

 

as of july 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” sfas 109 fin 48 clarifies the application of sfas 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements additionally fin 48 provides guidance on the measurement derecognition classification and disclosure of tax positions along with accounting for the related interest and penalties as a result of this adoption we recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle a 91635000 decrease in our beginning retained earnings on our july 1 2007 balance sheet 

 

pension measurement date change and sfas 158 adoption 

 

as of june 30 2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 the recognition provision requires an employer to recognize a plan’s funded status in its statement of financial position and recognize the changes in a postretirement benefit plan’s funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur the effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2007 was a decrease in prepaid pension cost of 83846000 a decrease in other assets of 43854000 an increase in accrued expenses of 10967000 a decrease in longterm deferred taxes of 73328000 an increase in other longterm liabilities of 52289000 and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of 117628000 the adoption of sfas 158’s recognition provision did not have an effect on our consolidated balance sheet as of july 1 2006 the adoption has no effect on our consolidated results of operations for any period presented and it will not affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods 

 

sfas 158 also has a measurement date provision which is a requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we changed the measurement date for companysponsored pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal yearend to may 31st to assist us in meeting accelerated sec filing dates as a result of this change we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by 9285000 net of tax with the issuance of sfas 158 we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time as a result beginning with fiscal 2008 the measurement date again corresponded with our fiscal yearend we performed measurements as of may 31 2007 and june 30 2007 of our plan assets and benefit obligations we recorded a charge to beginning retained earnings on july 1 2007 of 3572000 net of tax for the impact of the cumulative difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates we also recorded a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive income loss on july 1 2007 of 22780000 net of tax for the impact of the difference in our balance sheet recognition provision between the two measurement dates 

 

eitf 0413 adoption 

 

in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted accounting pronouncement eitf 0413 “accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty” eitf 0413 the accounting standard requires certain transactions where inventory is purchased by us from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer as defined to be presented in the income statement on a net basis this situation primarily arises for sysco when a customer has a proprietary item which they have either manufactured or sourced but they require our distribution and logistics capabilities to get the product to their locations the application of this standard requires sales and cost of sales to be reduced by the same amount for these transactions and thus net earnings are unaffected by the application of this standard we adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and have applied it to similar transactions prospectively prior period sales and cost of sales have not been restated therefore the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the noncomparable periods is affected the impact of adopting this standard resulted in sales being reduced by 99803000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and 253724000 for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2007 without a reduction in sales for the comparable prior year periods beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 sales are reported on a comparable accounting basis with the comparable prior year period 

sfas 123r adoption 

 

in fiscal 2006 we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r utilizing the modifiedprospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated our consolidated results of operations for all periods presented include sharebased compensation cost recorded in accordance with sfas 123r 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

 

 

sales 

 

sales for fiscal 2008 were 71 greater than fiscal 2007 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 01 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008 

 

sales for fiscal 2007 were 74 greater than fiscal 2006 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 07 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007 the impact of eitf 0413 reduced sales growth by 07 or 334002000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a 99803000 reduction for fiscal 2006 sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which is the oneyear anniversary of the adoption of eitf 0413 

 

product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices was a significant contributor to sales growth in fiscal 2008 and to a lesser extent in fiscal 2007 estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were approximately 60 during fiscal 2008 as compared to 34 during fiscal 2007 

 

the rate of sales growth declined throughout fiscal 2008 from 85 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to 54 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we believe the current general economic conditions which are placing pressure on consumer disposable income are contributing to a decline in real volume growth in the foodservice market and in turn have contributed to a slowdown in our sales growth to the extent that these conditions persist we believe that sales growth in fiscal 2009 will be lower than what was achieved in fiscal 2008 

 

we believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthen customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers 

 

operating income 

 

cost of sales primarily includes product costs net of vendor consideration as well as inbound freight operating expenses include the costs of facilities product handling delivery selling and general and administrative activities 

 

operating income increased 100 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 increasing to 50 of sales gross margin dollars increased 65 in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and operating expenses increased 53 in fiscal 2008 operating income increased 143 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 increasing to 49 of sales gross margin dollars increased 74 in fiscal 2007 and operating expenses increased 53 in fiscal 2007 

 

beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 sysco began experiencing product cost increases in numerous product categories these increases have persisted throughout fiscal 2008 at levels approximating 60 generally sysco attempts to pass increased costs to its customers however because of contractual and competitive reasons we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately sysco’s goal is to obtain the lowest total procurement cost for our customers we believe that we have managed the inflationary environment well as evidenced by gross margin dollars increasing in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 at rates greater than expense increases the high rate of product cost inflation has continued into fiscal 2009 we believe that prolonged periods of high inflation such as the current rate have a negative impact on our customers as rising food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the foodpreparedawayfrom home market as a result these factors may negatively impact our sales gross margins and earnings 

 

fiscal 2008 operating expenses were negatively impacted by a net 24135000 in additional expenses as compared to fiscal 2007 from the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and increased provisions related to multiemployer pension plans partially offset by lower sharebased compensation expense and lower companysponsored pension expenses in addition fuel costs increased during fiscal 2008 we increased our use of fuel surcharges to offset a portion of these increased costs thereby partially reducing the impact to operating income 

 

in fiscal 2007 the positive impact on operating expenses from decreases in companysponsored pension expenses sharebased compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance policies was largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives 

 

the carrying value of our corporateowned life insurance policies is adjusted to their cash surrender values this resulted in a loss of 8718000 in fiscal 2008 a gain of 23922000 in fiscal 2007 and a gain of 9702000 in fiscal 2006 

 

in fiscal 2008 we recorded a provision of 22284000 related to additional amounts that we expect to be required to contribute to an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in fiscal 2007 we recorded a provision of 4700000 related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan see additional discussion of multiemployer pension plans at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations” 

 

sharebased compensation cost in fiscal 2008 was 17335000 less than fiscal 2007 sharebased compensation expense decreased 28852000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 these decreases were primarily due to lower levels of stock option grants in recent years as compared to previous years 

 

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2008 were 8754000 less than fiscal 2007 due primarily to the funding status and the projected asset performance of the qualified pension plan net companysponsored pension costs decreased 56001000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year due primarily to the increase in the discount rate used to determine fiscal 2007 pension costs 

also affecting the comparison of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives due primarily to improved operating results the nonstock portion of management incentive bonus accruals increased 64770000 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 when our performance did not satisfy the criteria for paying bonuses to our corporate officers investments in strategic business initiatives increased 22410000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year 

 

in addition sysco’s fuel costs increased by 34023000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased diesel prices our fuel costs increased by 21225000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 due to increased diesel prices and increased volume usage sysco’s costs per gallon have increased 187 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and 71 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges represented approximately 06 06 and 05 of sales respectively sysco’s activities to manage increased fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds entering into forward fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges 

 

we periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements in fiscal 2008 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 21000000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in fiscal 2007 the forward purchase commitments resulted in prices that were comparable to market prices in fiscal 2006 the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated 9000000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were lower than market prices for the contracted volumes in july and august 2008 we entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaling approximately 195000000 through july 2009 which will lock in the price on approximately 50 of our fuel purchases through the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 and approximately 70 of our fuel purchases needs for the last 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 

 

in fiscal 2008 due to sustained increased diesel prices sysco increased its use of fuel surcharges fuel surcharges were approximately 27000000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007 the change in fuel surcharges in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was not significant fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins 

 

if fuel prices continue at current levels fuel costs in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 55000000 to 65000000 as compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008 our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in midaugust 2008 the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset this increase in fuel expense in fiscal 2009 including the continued use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management if fuel surcharges continue in fiscal 2009 at the same levels as the end of fiscal 2008 we estimate that we can recover about half of the anticipated increase in fuel costs noted above through increased fuel surcharges which is less than the approximate 75 we were able to recover in fiscal 2008 

 

customer accounts written off net of recoveries were 32367000 or 009 of sales 26010000 or 007 of sales and 21128000 or 006 of sales for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we continue to monitor our customer account balances and believe continued strong credit practices will be necessary to avoid significant increases in writeoffs in fiscal 2009 however if the challenging economic environment persists we could experience increased levels of writeoffs and a higher provision for losses on receivables in fiscal 2009 

 

net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 are expected to increase by approximately 20000000 due primarily to lower returns on assets of the qualified pension plan during fiscal 2008 partially offset by a decrease in expense due to amendments to our supplemental executive retirement plan sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2009 is expected to decrease 20000000 to 25000000 the expected decrease is due primarily to two factors first option grants in prior years were at greater levels than recent years resulting in reduced compensation expense being recognized secondly the management incentive plan annual bonus awards have been modified beginning with fiscal 2009 to exclude the previous stock award component as a result the sharebased compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years will not be incurred in fiscal 2009 and as a result fiscal 2009 will reflect reduced overall sharebased based compensation expenses beginning in fiscal 2010 we expect to replace the stock award component of the incentive bonuses with annual discretionary restricted stock grants subject to timebased vesting which may result in increased sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2010 

 

net earnings 

 

net earnings increased 105 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 net earnings increased 170 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the changes in net earnings for these periods were due primarily to the factors discussed above as well as the impact of changes in interest expense other income and income taxes discussed below additionally fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was impacted by a fiscal 2006 accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for companysponsored pension and other postretirement benefits plans which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by 9285000 net of tax 

 

the increase in interest expense of 6539000 in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased borrowing levels partially offset by lower interest rates on our floating rate debt the decrease in interest expense of 4098000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to decreased borrowing levels 

 

other income net increased 5195000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and 8719000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 changes between the years resulted from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities the increase in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily due to gains from the sale of land and facilities as well as the sale of a minority interest in a business the increase in fiscal 2007 over the prior year is primarily due to a gain on the sale of land 

the effective tax rate was 3825 in fiscal 2008 3825 in fiscal 2007 and 3935 in fiscal 2006 

 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately 7700000 resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change 8600000 related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and 5500000 related to the reduction in net canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions sharebased compensation expense and the recognition of losses to adjust the carrying value of corporateowned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values 

 

the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to lower sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance policies 

 

earnings per share 

 

basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 130 and 131 respectively in fiscal 2008 over the prior year basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 174 and 176 respectively in fiscal 2007 over the prior year these increases were primarily the result of factors discussed above as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and with regard to fiscal 2008 an increase in the number of antidilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation 

 

segment results 

 

we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” sfas no 131 the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item 8 of this form 10k intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 

 

prior to fiscal 2008 sysco’s management evaluated performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective earnings before income taxes this measure included an allocation of certain corporate expenses to each operating segment in addition to the centrally incurred costs for shared services that were charged to our segments during fiscal 2008 sysco’s management increased its focus on the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results which excludes the allocation of additional corporate expenses as a result the segment reporting for fiscal 2007 and 2006 has been revised to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation while a segment’s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins expenses or a combination thereof each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth this is consistent with our longterm goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

 

the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segments’ sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 

  

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments the other segment intersegment sales and corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments including certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments of which intercompany amounts are eliminated upon consolidation expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 

included in corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments among other items are 

  

broadline segment 

 

broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco’s operations in fiscal 2008 the broadline operating results represent approximately 80 of sysco’s overall sales and greater than 100 of sysco’s overall operating income prior to corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

 

there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments we have invested substantial amounts in assets operating methods technology and management expertise in this segment the breadth of its sales force geographic reach of its distribution area and purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment’s earnings 

 

sales 

 

sales for fiscal 2008 were 81 greater than fiscal 2007 noncomparable acquisitions did not have a material impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2008 growth was realized both from increased sales to multiunit customers and marketing associateserved customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers and efforts of our marketing associates product cost inflation and the resulting increases in selling prices was the primary contributor to sales growth 

 

sales for fiscal 2007 were 70 greater than fiscal 2006 the impact of eitf 0413 reduced sales growth by 04 or 173171000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a 57211000 reduction for fiscal 2006 sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which is the oneyear anniversary of the adoption of eitf 0413 noncomparable acquisitions did not have an impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007 fiscal 2007 growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associateserved customers and multiunit customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of our marketing associates 

 

operating income 

 

the increases in operating income in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses we were able to manage our business effectively in the current inflationary environment by managing margins and improving operating efficiencies gross margin dollars increased 70 while operating expenses increased 61 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the high cost of fuel also impacted our results fuel costs in fiscal 2008 were 21575000 higher than fiscal 2007 we attempt to mitigate increased fuel costs by reducing miles driven improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds entering into fixed price fuel purchase commitments and the use of fuel surcharges in fiscal 2008 due to sustained increased diesel prices our use of fuel surcharges increased fuel surcharges were approximately 21000000 higher in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 

 

in fiscal 2008 we recorded a provision of 22284000 related to additional amounts that we expect to be required to contribute to an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in fiscal 2007 we recorded a provision of 4700000 related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan 

 

the increases in operating income in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 were primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses gross margin dollars increased 66 while operating expenses increased 54 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 

sygma segment 

 

sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to certain chain restaurant customer locations sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s other segments this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 

 

sales 

 

sales for fiscal 2008 were 44 greater than fiscal 2007 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 03 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2008 growth was generally due to product cost increases and sales to new customers these increases were partially offset by lost sales due to nonrenewed customer agreements and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting sygma’s customer base 

 

sales for fiscal 2007 were 60 greater than fiscal 2006 the impact of eitf 0413 reduced sales growth by 27 or 159236000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a 42560000 reduction for fiscal 2006 sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which is the oneyear anniversary of the adoption of eitf 0413 noncomparable acquisitions contributed 21 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007 the remaining fiscal 2007 growth was due to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma’s existing customer base related to increased sales at existing locations as well as new locations added by those customers in addition certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations contributing to the sales increase 

 

operating income 

 

operating income in fiscal 2008 decreased as compared to fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 sygma expensed 5587000 related to the writeoff of software development costs  in addition some of sygma’s customers have experienced a slowdown in their business resulting in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop sygma also experienced increased fuel costs of 8888000 although it was able to partially offset these costs through increases in the fees charged to customers including fuel surcharges and reducing expenses fuel surcharges were approximately 6000000 higher in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 expense reductions were accomplished by consolidating regional offices reducing headcounts and not renewing unprofitable customer contracts 

 

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2007 was due to several factors including sales growth increased margins and improved operating efficiencies partially offset by costs of labor increases and auto liability related expenses in addition the transfer of customers from broadline operations referred to above also contributed to the increase in operating income 

 

other segment 

 

“other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments including our specialty produce customcut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under sfas no 131 

 

on an aggregate basis our “other” segments have a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco’s broadline segment sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry these operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment in the aggregate the “other” segment represented approximately 97 and 73 of sysco’s overall sales and operating income in fiscal 2008 respectively 

 

operating income increased 33 for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 the increase in operating income was generated primarily by improved results in the specialty produce and the lodging industry segments offset by reduced sales and operating income in the customcut meat segment 

 

operating income increased 62 for fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 the increase in operating income was generated by improved results in each of the other segments and acquisitions 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada we intend to continue to expand our market share through profitable sales growth foldouts and acquisitions we also strive to increase the effectiveness of our operations through the use of technology and our supply chain and other strategic initiatives these objectives require continuing investment our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 

 

our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements investments in facilities systems fleet and other equipment cash dividends and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy any remaining cash generated from operations may be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional debt our share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of longterm debt to total capitalization historically our longterm debt to total capitalization ratio has generally been in the 

range of 35 and 40 this ratio was 368 and 350 as of june 28 2008 and june 30 2007 respectively for purposes of calculating this ratio longterm debt includes both the current maturities and longterm portion we continue to assess and review the most appropriate capital structure as well as the appropriate leverage ratios with which to measure that capital structure as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis we regularly evaluate business opportunities including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses and our overall capital structure these transactions may materially impact our liquidity borrowing capacity leverage ratios and capital availability 

 

we believe that our cash flows from operations the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next twelve months while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 

 

operating activities 

 

we generated 1596129000 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 1402922000 in fiscal 2007 and 1124679000 in fiscal 2006 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was primarily due to net income in these years reduced by increases in inventory balances and increases in accounts receivable balances partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily due to sales growth the accounts payable balances did not increase at the same rate as inventory increases accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors including changes in product mix cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 

 

cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by a decrease in accrued expenses of 22721000 during fiscal 2008 and was positively impacted by increases in accrued expenses of 132936000 during fiscal 2007 and 29161000 during fiscal 2006 the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixedrate debt issued in fiscal 2008 and an increase to a provision related to a multiemployer pension plan see additional discussion of multiemployer pension plans at “liquidity and capital resources other considerations” the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased accruals for fiscal 2007 incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over fiscal 2006 the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2006 was related to various miscellaneous accruals 

 

in fiscal 2007 we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of 50296000 and the corresponding insurance receivable of 48296000 included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal 2008 these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment in excess of our deductible see further discussion of the product liability claim under note 18 commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net increased 13459000 during fiscal 2008 decreased 14817000 in fiscal 2007 and increased 75382000 in fiscal 2006 the increase in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred compensation from incentive compensation deferrals of prioryear annual incentive bonuses and the accrual of interest on our liability for unrecognized tax benefits these increases were partially offset by the recording of net companysponsored pension costs and the timing of pension contributions to our companysponsored plans in fiscal 2007 and 2006 the change in these accounts was primarily attributable to the recording of net companysponsored pension costs and the timing and amount of pension contributions to our companysponsored plans in fiscal 2007 our pension contributions exceeded the amount of net pension costs recognized during the year resulting in a net cash outflow in fiscal 2006 the net pension costs recorded exceeded the amount of pension contributions during the year resulting in a net cash inflow we recorded net companysponsored pension costs of 65837000 74591000 and 130592000 during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively our contributions to our companysponsored defined benefit plans were 92670000 91163000 and 73764000 during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively we expect to contribute approximately 97000000 to our companysponsored defined benefit plans in fiscal 2009 

 

investing activities 

 

fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included 

  

fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included 

  

fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included 

 20 

 

the lower amount spent in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to delays on certain projects that will shift significant expenditures to fiscal 2009 as a result we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 to be in the range of 675000000 to 725000000 fiscal 2009 expenditures will include the continuation of the foldout program facility fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions the company’s national supply chain initiative and investments in technology 

 

financing activities 

 

equity 

 

we routinely engage in boardapproved share repurchase programs the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 16769900 shares for 529179000 in fiscal 2008 16231200 shares for 550865000 in fiscal 2007 and 16479800 shares for 544131000 in fiscal 2006 an additional 125000 shares have been purchased at a cost of 3933000 through august 13 2008 resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to 6212800 shares based on the trades made through that date 

 

dividends paid were 497467000 or 082 per share in fiscal 2008 445416000 or 072 per share in fiscal 2007 and 397537000 or 064 per share in fiscal 2006 in may 2008 we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 of 022 per share which was paid in july 2008 

 

in november 2000 we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering 30000000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions as of august 13 2008 29477835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 

 

shortterm borrowings 

 

we have uncommitted bank lines of credit which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to 145000000 of which none was outstanding as of june 28 2008 or august 13 2008 

 

commercial paper 

 

we have a commercial paper program allowing us to issue shortterm unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed 1300000000 the current program was entered into in april 2006 and replaced notes that were issued under our previous commercial paper program as they matured and became due and payable 

 

sysco and one of our subsidiaries sysco international co has a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs the facility in the amount of 1000000000 terminates on november 4 2012 subject to extension 

 

this facility was originally entered into in november 2005 in the amount of 500000000 and was increased to 750000000 in march 2006 in september 2006 the termination date on the facility was extended to november 4 2011 in accordance with the terms of the agreement in september 2007 the amount of the facility was increased to 1000000000 and the termination date on the facility was extended to november 4 2012 this facility replaced the previous 450000000 us dollar and 100000000 canadian dollar revolving credit agreements in the us and canada respectively both of which were terminated in november 2005 

 

during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to 1133241000 356804000 to 755180000 126846000 to 774530000 respectively there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of june 28 2008 or august 13 2008 

 

fixed rate debt 

 

in july 2005 we repaid the 475 senior notes totaling 200000000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

 

in september 2005 we issued 5375 senior notes totaling 500000000 due on september 21 2035 under the april 2005 shelf registration these notes which were priced at 99911 of par are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of september 2005 

 

in september 2005 in conjunction with the issuance of the 5375 senior notes described above we settled a 350000000 notional amount forwardstarting interest rate swap we had entered into in march 2005 upon termination we paid cash of 21196000 which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination this amount is being amortized as interest expense over the 30year term of the debt and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss net of tax in other comprehensive income loss 

 

in may 2006 we repaid at maturity the 70 senior notes totaling 200000000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

 

in april 2007 we repaid at maturity the 725 senior notes totaling 100000000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

in january 2008 the sec granted our request to terminate our then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the sec in april 2005 for the issuance of debt securities in february 2008 we filed an automatically effective wellknown seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to 1000000000 in debt securities with the sec 

 

in february 2008 we issued 420 senior notes totaling 250000000 due february 12 2013 the “2013 notes” and 525 senior notes totaling 500000000 due february 12 2018 the “2018 notes” under our february 2008 shelf registration the 2013 and 2018 notes which were priced at 99835 and 99310 of par respectively are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of february 2008 

 

total debt 

 

total debt as of june 28 2008 was 1980331000 of which approximately 99 was at fixed rates averaging 54 and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 22 certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders including provisions to maintain our longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of june 28 2008 

 

other 

 

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements as of june 28 2008 and june 30 2007 letters of credit outstanding were 35785000 and 62645000 respectively 

 

other considerations 

 

multiemployer pension plans 

 

as discussed in note 18 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the information available from plan administrators we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multiemployer plans we participate in some of which appear to be underfunded could be as much as 140000000 based on a voluntary withdrawal 

 

required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations borrowing capacity or a combination of these items of the plans in which sysco participates one plan is more critically underfunded than the others during fiscal 2008 we obtained information that this plan failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and believe it is probable that additional funding will be required as well as the payment of excise tax as a result we recorded a liability of approximately 16500000 related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods currently we believe that a majority of this amount will be paid in fiscal 2009 and are continuing to explore our alternatives as it relates to this plan as of june 28 2008 we have approximately 22000000 in liabilities recorded in total related to certain underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plans 

 

bscc cooperative structure 

 

our affiliate bscc is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code we believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of bscc are appropriate under the tax laws however if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of bscc were to be successfully challenged by any federal state or local tax authority we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with bscc that we otherwise have deferred until future periods in that event we would be liable for interest on such amounts as of june 28 2008 sysco has recorded deferred income tax liabilities of 1054190000 net of federal benefit related to the bscc supply chain distributions if the irs and any other relevant taxing authorities determine that all amounts since the inception of bscc were inappropriately deferred and the determination is upheld we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred as discussed above we may be required to pay interest on the cumulative deferred balances these interest amounts could range from 290000000 to 320000000 prior to federal and state income tax benefit as of june 28 2008 sysco calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of bscc applying the applicable jurisdictions’ interest rates in effect in each period the irs in connection with its audit of our 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments related to the taxability of the cooperative structure we are vigorously protesting these adjustments we have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the irs and while management believes it is probable we will prevail we concluded the measurement model of fin 48 required us to provide an accrual for a portion of the interest exposure if a taxing authority requires us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest 

if any we may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or we may have to forego share repurchases or defer planned capital expenditures or a combination of these items 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table sets forth as of june 28 2008 certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

 

 

 

  

certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 28 2008 included 55469000 in cash this amount is not included in the table above 

 

no obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of june 28 2008 we do not have a minimum funding requirement under erisa guidelines for this plan due to our previous voluntary contributions however we intend to make voluntary contributions to the qualified retirement plan totaling 80000000 during fiscal 2009 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

receivable selfinsurance programs companysponsored pension plans income taxes vendor consideration accounting for business combinations and sharebased compensation 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries in addition in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivables if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

 

selfinsurance program 

 

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

 

companysponsored pension plans 

 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

 

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the companysponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan which was determined as of the june 30 2007 measurement date increased 005 to 678 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 30 2007 measurement date decreased 009 to 664 the combined effect of these discount rate changes was a decrease in our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2008 by an estimated 480000 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the retirement plan which was determined as of the june 28 2008 measurement date increased 016 to 694 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 28 2008 measurement date increased 039 to 703 the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net companysponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2009 by an estimated 8692000 a 10 increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2009 would decrease sysco’s net companysponsored pension cost by 32000000 while a 10 decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by 49000000 the impact of a 10 increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 10 decrease in discount rates because a 10 decrease in discount rates would require additional amounts of amortization from net actuarial losses which would not be required with a 10 increase in this rate as of june 28 2008 our net actuarial losses from our companysponsored pension plans were 351344000 an increase of 192438000 we estimate the amortization of net actuarial losses will increase our fiscal 2009 pension expense by approximately 14000000 as compared to fiscal 2008 

 

we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels we used a plan specific agerelated set of rates for the retirement plan which are equivalent to a single rate of 617 as of june 28 2008 and june 30 2007 as of june 28 2008 the serp assumes various levels of base salary increase and decrease for determining pay for fiscal 2009 depending upon the participant’s position with the company and a 7 salary growth assumption for all participants for fiscal 2010 and thereafter as of june 30 2007 the serp assumed salary rate increases of 10 through fiscal 2007 and 7 thereafter 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 850 for fiscal 2008 and 900 for fiscal 2007 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on longterm bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 90 73 121 and 83 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2007 respectively in addition in nine of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 100 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 800 for fiscal 2009 a 10 increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2009 would decrease increase sysco’s net companysponsored pension costs for fiscal 2009 by approximately 15900000 

the adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas 158 as of june 30 2007 resulted in the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june 30 2007 after adoption of sfas 158 was a charge net of tax of 125265000 which represented the net actuarial losses prior service costs and transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of sfas 87106 as of that date the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june 28 2008 was a charge net of tax of 220913000 

 

changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plans the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions decreased net companysponsored pension costs by 8754000 in fiscal 2008 and are expected to increase net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 by approximately 27200000 however a change in the serp design is expected to decrease net companysponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 by 7200000 for a net increase of approximately 20000000 

 

we made cash contributions to our companysponsored pension plans of 92670000 and 91163000 in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of 80000000 and 80000000 in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively in fiscal 2009 as in the previous years contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but we anticipate that we will make voluntary contributions of 80000000 which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2009 the estimated fiscal 2009 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other postretirement plans together are approximately 17401000 

 

income taxes 

 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

 

prior to fiscal 2008 in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions we established an accrual when despite our belief that our tax return positions were supportable we believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss was probable when facts and circumstances changed these accruals were adjusted beginning in fiscal 2008 we adopted fin 48 which changed the accounting for uncertain tax positions fin 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement see discussion under note 16 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable however actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

 

vendor consideration 

 

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized in certain of these latter instances the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco in these cases we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognize these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 

 

accounting for business combinations 

 

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

 

in addition annually or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill 

impairment are our six operating segments as described in note 19 business segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units 

 

we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our six operating segments the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated average sales and earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry average sales and earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past future cash flow estimates of the reporting units and weighted average cost of capital along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 

 

actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years’ actual results sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units in fiscal 2008 the reporting units’ fair values would have had to have been lower by 20 compared to the fair values estimated in our impairment analysis before additional analysis would have been indicated to determine if an impairment existed for any of our reporting units 

 

the other specialty produce customcut meat lodging industry products and international distribution operations operating segments have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the broadline or sygma reporting units this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the broadline and sygma segments in addition these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the broadline segment as such these other operating segments have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

we provide compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plan and various nonemployee director plans 

 

effective july 3 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r using the modifiedprospective transition method under this transition method compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 and later years includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted through july 2 2005 but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of july 2 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to july 2 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r results for periods prior to fiscal 2006 have not been restated 

 

as of june 28 2008 there was 66432000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 288 years 

 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

 

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans is based on the stock price less a 12 discount for postvesting restrictions the discount for postvesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 

 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 

 

the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

 

certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period in those cases we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in other cases certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performancebased provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate in these cases if it is probable that the performance condition will be met we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the shorter performance period otherwise we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 

in addition certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee or director in these cases for awards granted prior to july 2 2005 we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires for awards granted subsequent to july 3 2005 we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 

 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

 

new accounting standards 

 

sfas 159 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities” sfas 159 sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value sfas 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we have decided not to adopt sfas 159 for our existing financial assets and liabilities at the date of option thus there will be no onetime impact from adoption of this standard to our consolidated financial statements 

 

sfas 141r 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” sfas 141r which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in a business combination this statement also establishes recognition and measurement principles for the goodwill acquired in a business combination and disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination we will apply this statement primarily on a prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal 2010 earlier application of the standard is prohibited 

 

fsp 1572 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 which establishes a common definition for fair value under generally accepted accounting principles establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” fsp 1572 which partially defers the effective date of sfas no 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis consequently sfas 157 will be effective for sysco in fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as a result of the deferral sfas 157 will be effective in fiscal 2010 for nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value we believe the adoption of sfas 157 in fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements we are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting the provisions of sfas 157 in fiscal 2010 for nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value 

 

sfas 161 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133” sfas 161 sfas 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting this statement will be effective for sysco’s financial statements beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 161 may have on its financial statement disclosures 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business expense trends anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans the outcome of ongoing tax audits the impact of ongoing legal proceedings the loss of sysco’s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position longterm debt to capitalization ratios anticipated capital expenditures and the sources of financing for those capital expenditures continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic business initiatives anticipated companysponsored pension 

plan liabilities the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

 

these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item 1a above and elsewhere in addition the success of sysco’s strategic business initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs the ability to meet longterm debt to capitalization ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth companysponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets legal proceedings are impacted by events circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect as well the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect and laws and regulations as well as methods of enforcement are subject to change

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate risk 

 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

 

fiscal 2008 

 

as of june 28 2008 we had no commercial paper outstanding our longterm debt obligations as of june 28 2008 were 1980331000 of which approximately 99 were at fixed rates of interest we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of june 28 2008 

 

the following table presents our interest rate position as of june 28 2008 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

 

 

fiscal 2007 

 

as of june 30 2007 we had outstanding 531826000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through september 24 2007 excluding commercial paper issuances our longterm debt obligations as of june 30 2007 were 1229969000 of which approximately 99 were at fixed rates of interest we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of june 30 2007 

in the following table as of june 30 2007 commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the us and canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as longterm based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our us and canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a longterm basis 

 

the following table presents our interest rate position as of june 30 2007 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

we have canadian subsidiaries all of which use the canadian dollar as their functional currency with the exception of a financing subsidiary to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in canadian dollars we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within shareholders’ equity due to translation of the financial statements from canadian dollars to us dollars our canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in us dollars which has the potential to create taxable income in canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2008 yearend exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 

 

fuel price risk 

 

the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately 06 06 and 05 of sales respectively fuel costs excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges incurred by sysco increased by approximately 34023000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 and 21225000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 

 

from time to time we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 28 2008 we had no outstanding forward diesel fuel purchase commitments in july and august 2008 we entered into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaling approximately 195000000 through july 2009 which will lock in the price on approximately 50 of our fuel purchases through the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 and approximately 70 of our fuel purchases needs for the last 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 

 

if fuel prices continue at current levels fuel costs in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009 exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges are expected to increase by approximately 55000000 to 65000000 as compared to the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2008 our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel midaugust 2008 the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place and estimates of fuel consumption actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates a 10 unfavorable or favorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential increase to 50000000 to 70000000

sysco which was formed when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for sysco common stock commenced operations in march 1970 since our formation we have grown from 115 million to over 35 billion in annual sales both through internal expansion of existing operations and through acquisitions through the end of fiscal 2007 we have acquired 141 companies or divisions of companies 

during fiscal 2007 we completed the acquisition of bunn capitol a foodservice distributor located in springfield illinois

operating segments 

sysco provides food and related products to the foodservice or “foodpreparedawayfromhome” industry under the provisions of sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” sfas 131 we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in sfas 131 broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to both our traditional and chain restaurant customers sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of nonfood products to chain restaurant customer locations “other” financial information is attributable to our other segments including our specialty produce customcut meat and lodging industry products segments and a company that distributes to internationally located chain restaurants specialty produce companies distribute fresh produce and on a limited basis other foodservice products specialty meat companies distribute customcut fresh steaks other meat seafood and poultry our lodging industry products company distributes personal care guest amenities equipment housekeeping supplies room accessories and textiles to the lodging industry selected financial data for each of our reportable segments as well as financial information concerning geographic areas can be found in note 17 business segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

customers and products 

the foodservice industry consists of two major customer types — “traditional” and “chain restaurant” traditional foodservice customers include restaurants hospitals schools hotels and industrial caterers our chain restaurant customers include regional and national hamburger sandwich pizza chicken steak and other chain operations 

services to our traditional foodservice and chain restaurant customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

the products we distribute include 

 

 

we also supply a wide variety of nonfood items including 

 

our operating companies distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under our private brands products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team in addition our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements 

we believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of products to traditional customers our operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through our more than 14400 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and our operating companies we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services our operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total sales for the fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

our sales to chain restaurant customers consist of a variety of food products we believe that consistent product quality and timely and accurate service are important factors when a chain restaurant selects a foodservice supplier one chain restaurant customer wendy’s international inc accounted for 5 of our sales for fiscal year ended june 30 2007 although this customer represents approximately 39 of the sygma segment sales we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

based upon available information we estimate that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

sources of supply 

we purchase from thousands of suppliers none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of our purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers generally purchasing is carried out through centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating companies we continually develop relationships with suppliers but have no material longterm purchase commitments with any supplier 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we began a project to restructure our supply chain national supply chain project this project is intended to increase profitability by lowering aggregate inventory levels operating costs and future facility expansion needs at our broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

the national supply chain project involved the creation of the baugh supply chain cooperative inc bscc which administers a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines the operating companies can choose to purchase product from the suppliers participating in the cooperative’s programs or from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through the cooperative’s programs 

the national supply chain project has three major supply chain initiatives actively underway the first initiative involves the construction and operation of regional distribution centers which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region we currently expect to build five to seven redistribution centers rdcs the first of these centers the northeast rdc located in front royal virginia opened during the third 

quarter of fiscal 2005 a second rdc located in alachua florida is being constructed and is expected to become operational in the latter half of fiscal 2008 sysco has purchased the site for a third rdc in hamlet indiana the second initiative is the national transportation management initiative which provides the capability to view and manage all of sysco’s inbound freight both to rdcs and the operating companies as a network and not as individual locations as of june 2007 all inbound freight to united states broadline operating companies is managed centrally the third initiative is the national implementation of demand planning and inventory management software this project is strategically important in that it creates the foundation to effectively execute new supply chain processes including redistribution as well as efficiently manage our inventory assets 

working capital practices 

our growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations at item 7 regarding our liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

credit terms we extend to our customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on our assessment of the customers’ credit risk we monitor the customers’ accounts and will suspend shipments to customers if necessary 

a majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when the customers’ orders are placed we will generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand we also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities 

we take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receive payment terms from our suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

corporate headquarters’ services 

our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance cash management information technology employee benefits engineering risk management and insurance the corporate office makes available legal marketing payroll human resources training and development information technology and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

to maximize productivity and customer service we continue to construct and modernize our distribution facilities during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 approximately 603242000 513934000 and 390026000 respectively were invested in facility expansions fleet additions and other capital asset enhancements we estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 should be in the range of 625000000 to 650000000 during the three years ended june 30 2007 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings we expect to finance our fiscal 2008 capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

as of june 30 2007 we had approximately 50900 fulltime employees approximately 18 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company approximately 26 of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which will expire during fiscal 2008 we consider our labor relations to be satisfactory 

competition 

sysco’s business environment is competitive with numerous companies engaged in foodservice distribution our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets while competition is encountered primarily from local and regional distributors a few companies compete with us on a national basis we believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices we estimate that we serve about 15 of an approximately 225 billion annual market that includes the foodservice and hotel amenity furniture and textile markets both in the united states and canada we believe based upon industry trade data that our sales to the united states and canada “foodpreparedawayfromhome” industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2007 while adequate industry statistics are not available we believe that in most instances our local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas 

government regulation 

as a marketer and distributor of food products we are subject to the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration fda as well as the canadian food and drugs act and the regulations thereunder 

the fda regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through its manufacturing practice regulations specifies the standards of identity for certain foods and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels for certain product lines we are also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us department of agriculture usda the usda imposes standards for product quality and sanitation including the inspection and labeling of meat and poultry products and the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers we are also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

in canada the canadian food inspection agency administers and enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards established by health canada under the canadian food and drugs act and under other related federal legislation including the canada agricultural products act the meat inspection act the fish inspection act and the consumer packaging and labeling act as it relates to food these laws regulate the processing storing grading packaging marking transporting and inspection of certain sysco product lines as well as the packaging labeling sale importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products 

we and our products are also subject to state provincial and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities enforcement by state provincial and local health agencies of state provincial and local standards for our products and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products our facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor together with similar occupational health and safety laws in each canadian province these regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute 

we are also subject to regulation by numerous us and canadian federal state provincial and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor and each canadian provincial ministry of labour which set employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation and the canadian transportation agency which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

most of our distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks other us and canadian federal state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials do not materially impact the use or operation of our facilities 

compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

general 

we have numerous trademarks which are of significant importance to the company the loss of the syscor trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

as of june 30 2007 we operated 177 distribution facilities throughout the united states and canada 




 item 1a risk factors 

our low margin business may be negatively impacted by product cost deflation product cost inflation or other economic conditions 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup as a result our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant prolonged periods of product cost inflation also may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent that we are unable to pass on such product cost increases the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions inflation fuel costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact our sales and operating results our operating results are also sensitive to and may be adversely affected by other factors including difficulties collecting accounts receivable competitive price pressures severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportationrelated costs although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on our past operations there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 

increased fuel costs can lower demand for our products and increase our costs 

increased fuel costs can have a negative impact on our results of operations the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home the high cost of fuel can also increase the price paid by us for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers these factors in turn may negatively impact our sales margins operating expenses and operating results 

conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs 

we obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third party suppliers for the most part we do not have longterm contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us although our purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested because we do not control the actual production of the products we sell we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to the outbreak of avian flu or similar foodborne illnesses in the united states and canada our inability to obtain adequate supplies of our foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

taxing authorities may successfully challenge our baugh supply chain cooperative structure 

the national supply chain project involved the creation of the bscc which administers a consolidated product procurement program to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products bscc is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code we believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of bscc are appropriate under the tax laws however if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of bscc were to be successfully challenged by any federal state or local tax authority we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with bscc that we otherwise had deferred until future periods and in that event would be liable for interest on such amounts as of june 30 2007 we have recorded deferred income tax liabilities of 988000000 related to the bscc supply chain distributions this amount represents the income tax liabilities related to bscc that were accrued but the payment had been deferred as of june 30 2007 in addition if the irs or any other taxing authority determines that all amounts since the inception of bscc were inappropriately deferred or that bscc should have been a taxable entity we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred as discussed above we may have additional liability representing interest that would be payable on the cumulative deferred balances ranging from 185000000 to 205000000 prior to federal and state income tax benefit as of june 30 2007 we calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of bscc applying the applicable jurisdictions’ interest rates in effect each period during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 the internal revenue service irs in connection with its audit of our 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments related to the taxability of bscc we are vigorously protesting these adjustments we have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the irs and based upon such review we have not recorded any related amount in any period a taxing authority requiring us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest if any could cause us to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may have to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination of these items 

we need access to borrowed funds in order to grow 

because a substantial part of our growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion our continued growth depends in large part on our ability to continue this expansion as a result our inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict our ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing our indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows as well as the market value of our common stock further our leveraged position may also increase our vulnerability to competitive pressures 

product liability claims could materially and adversely impact our business 

we like any other seller of food face the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by sysco causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims we believe we have sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying our products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce our net earnings and earnings per share 

adverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings 

maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business particularly to selling sysco brand products anything that damages that reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of our products could quickly affect our revenues and profits reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation if patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales to decrease dramatically 

failure to successfully renegotiate union contracts could result in work stoppages 

as of june 30 2007 approximately 9000 employees at 54 operating companies were members of 60 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2008 14 agreements covering approximately 2300 employees will expire failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although our operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and we believe they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 

a shortage of qualified labor could negatively impact our business and materially reduce earnings 

our operations rely heavily on our employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve our customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our net earnings 

we may be required to pay material amounts under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans 

we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees approximately 11 of our current employees are participants in such multiemployer plans in fiscal 2007 our total contributions to these plans were approximately 37296000 

we do not directly manage these multiemployer plans which are generally managed by boards of trustees half of whom are appointed by the unions and the other half by other contributing employers to the plan based upon the information available to us from plan administrators we believe that some of these multiemployer plans are underfunded due partially to a decline in the value of the assets supporting these plans a reduction in the number of actively participating members for whom employer contributions are required and the level of benefits provided by the plans in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 will require underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding perhaps beginning as soon as calendar 2008 as a result our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make 

payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the information available from plan administrators we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on all the multiemployer plans we participate in some of which appear to be underfunded could be as much as 120000000 in addition if a multiemployer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements the irs may impose a nondeductible excise tax of 5 on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 

we must finance and integrate acquired businesses wisely 

historically a portion of our growth has come through acquisitions if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner our earnings per share may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited or no expertise or with a culture different from sysco’s a significant expansion of our business and operations in terms of geography or magnitude could strain our administrative and operational resources significant acquisitions may also require the issuance of material additional amounts of debt or equity which could materially alter our debt to equity ratio increase our interest expense and decrease earnings per share and make it difficult for us to obtain favorable financing for other acquisitions or capital investments 

expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and our expansion efforts and international operations may not be successful 

in addition to our importing and exporting activities our strategy includes expansion of operations into new international markets our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs legal and regulatory constraints political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include among others the costs and difficulties of managing international operations difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers suffering possible adverse tax consequences maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights additionally foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations 

our preferred stock provides antitakeover benefits that may not be beneficial to stockholders 

under our restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 1500000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquirer as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to our stockholders could be deterred 

technology dependence could have a material negative impact on our business 

our ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as our ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of our technology network we use software and other technology systems to load trucks in the most efficient manner to optimize the use of storage space and minimize the time spent at each stop any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact our customer service decrease the volume of our business and result in increased costs while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers our operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies specialty produce companies customcut meat operations hotel supply operations sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to internationally located chain restaurants 

we estimate that we serve about 15 of an approximately 225 billion annual market that includes foodservice market and hotel amenity furniture and textile market both in the united states and canada according to industry sources the foodservice or foodpreparedawayfromhome market represents approximately onehalf of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level this share grew from about 37 in 1972 to about 50 in 1998 and has not changed materially since that time 

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodpreparedawayfromhome and in turn can impact our sales historically we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry we intend to continue to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth brand management productivity gains sales force effectiveness and supply chain management 

strategic business initiatives 

in fiscal 2006 our executive team with the approval of the board of directors established a strategy team to examine many aspects of our businesses with an emphasis on strategic focus areas which would help us achieve our longterm vision of becoming the global leader of the efficient multitemperature food product value chain during fiscal 2007 we began to move from identifying strategic opportunities and developing a strategy process to implementing the initiatives that came from that process near the end of the fiscal year we announced new responsibilities for several executives as we integrated the strategy teams and their initiatives into our business a strategic management function will remain in place to help put strategic business initiatives into action and continue to refine and develop corporate strategy 

the following areas generally comprise the initiatives that will serve as the foundation of our efforts to ensure a sustainable future each area is staffed with sysco associates focused on the following 

 

a major component of our national supply chain project entails the use of redistribution centers rdcs the first rdc the northeast rdc located in front royal virginia opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 in january 2006 we completed the purchase of land in alachua florida for the future site of our second rdc which will service our five broadline operating companies in florida construction of the building site is in progress and this facility is expected to be operational in fiscal 2008 in march 2007 we purchased the site for construction of a third rdc in hamlet indiana 

we will continue to use our strategic business initiatives to help us grow by leveraging our market leadership position to continuously improve how our associates buy handle and market products for our customers our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in north america 

we are currently working to expand our import and export business we will also continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities and stay abreast of international acquisition opportunities 

accounting changes 

as of june 30 2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 the recognition provision requires an employer to recognize a plan’s funded status in its statement of financial position and recognize the changes in a postretirement benefit plan’s funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur the effect of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2007 was a decrease in prepaid pension cost of 83846000 a decrease in other assets of 43854000 an increase in accrued expenses of 10967000 a decrease in longterm deferred taxes of 73328000 an increase in other longterm liabilities of 52289000 and a charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of 117268000 the adoption of sfas 158’s recognition provision did not have an effect on our consolidated balance sheet as of july 1 2006 the adoption has no effect on our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2007 or for any prior year presented and it will not affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods 

sfas 158 also has a measurement date provision which is a requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we changed the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal yearend to may 31st to assist us in meeting accelerated sec filing dates as a result of this change we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by 9285000 net of tax with the issuance of sfas 158 we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time as a result beginning in fiscal 2008 the measurement date will return to correspond with our fiscal yearend we have performed measurements as of may 31 2007 and june 30 2007 of our plan assets and benefit obligations we will record a charge to beginning retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately 4000000 net of tax for the impact of the cumulative difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates we will also record a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of approximately 23000000 net of tax for the impact of the difference in our balance sheet recognition provision between the two measurement dates 

in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we adopted accounting pronouncement eitf 0413 “accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty” eitf 0413 the accounting standard requires certain transactions where inventory is purchased by us from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer as defined to be presented in the income statement on a net basis this situation primarily arises for sysco when a customer has a proprietary item which they have either manufactured or sourced but they require our distribution and logistics capabilities to get the product to their locations the application of this standard requires sales and cost of sales to be reduced by the same amount for these transactions and thus net earnings are unaffected by the application of this standard we adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and have applied it to similar transactions prospectively prior period sales and cost of sales have not been restated therefore the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the noncomparable periods is affected the impact of adopting this standard resulted in sales being reduced by 99803000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and 253724000 for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2007 without a reduction in sales for the comparable prior year periods beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 sales are reported on a comparable accounting basis with the comparable prior year period 

in fiscal 2006 we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r utilizing the modifiedprospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2006 include incremental sharebased compensation cost over what would have been recorded had the company continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 of 118038000 105810000 net of tax our consolidated results of operations for all future periods will include sharebased compensation cost recorded in accordance with sfas 123r 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

 

sales 

sales for fiscal 2007 were 74 greater than fiscal 2006 acquisitions contributed 07 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 the impact of eitf 0413 reduced sales growth by 07 or 334002000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a 99803000 reduction for fiscal 2006 sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which is the oneyear anniversary of the adoption of eitf 0413 

sales for fiscal 2006 were 78 greater than fiscal 2005 acquisitions contributed 14 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 the adoption of eitf 0413 at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 negatively impacted sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 03 

estimated product cost increases were 34 during fiscal 2007 as compared to 06 during fiscal 2006 

we believe that our continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers and the continued investment in increasing the number of customer contact personnel contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2007 and 2006 the number of customer contact personnel increased 5 during fiscal 2007 and 6 during fiscal 2006 in addition we believe fiscal 2006 sales growth was aided by a declining rate of product cost increases experienced throughout the year which lessened the overall gross margin pressures and contributed to underlying unit growth 

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 11 in calendar year 2006 and 17 in calendar year 2005 

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

 

a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below 

 

gross margins 

gross margins as a percentage of sales were 193 for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 the impact of eitf 0413 contributed a 012 increase to gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 

estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were 34 for fiscal 2007 the rate of product cost rose throughout the year ending at an estimated 61 for the fourth quarter product cost increases result in reduced gross margins as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior year as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollars base however the company was able to manage this inflationary environment well resulting in gross profit dollars increasing 74 for the year 

gross margins as a percentage of sales were 193 for fiscal 2006 as compared to 191 for fiscal 2005 the adoption of eitf 0413 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 contributed 006 to the increase in gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 management believes that the remaining gross margin increase as a percentage of sales was aided by several factors including low product cost inflation and effective merchandising 

while we can not predict if product cost inflation will continue in future periods in general we believe prolonged periods of high inflation may have a negative impact on our customers and as a result on our sales gross margins and earnings 

operating expenses 

operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling administrative and occupancy expenses 

operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 144 for fiscal 2007 as compared to 147 for fiscal 2006 the impact of eitf 0413 increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 009 for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of sales prior to the effect of the impact of eitf 0413 was primarily due to efficiencies obtained at the operating company level decreases in pension and sharebased compensation expenses and higher gains related to the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance policies were largely offset by increased management incentive bonus accruals and investments in strategic business initiatives 

sharebased compensation expense decreased 28852000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year due primarily to the completion of expense recognition in fiscal 2006 of a significant number of options granted in fiscal 2002 net pension costs decreased 56001000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year due primarily to the increase in the discount rate used to determine fiscal 2007 pension costs 

operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of 23922000 in fiscal 2007 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value this compared to the recognition of a gain of 9702000 in fiscal 2006 due primarily to improved operating results the nonstock portion of management incentive bonus accruals increased 64770000 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 when our performance did not satisfy the criteria for paying bonuses to our corporate officers investments in strategic business initiatives increased 22410000 in fiscal 2007 over the prior year 

operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 147 for fiscal 2006 as compared to 139 for fiscal 2005 the impact of eitf 0413 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 004 for fiscal 2006 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales included incremental sharebased compensation increased fuel costs increased pension costs and increased expenses associated with the national supply chain project partially offset by reduced management incentive bonus accruals 

sharebased compensation expense increased 107088000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year resulting from incremental expense incurred due to the adoption of sfas 123r see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 fuel costs increased 48600000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year net pension costs increased 23734000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of 9702000 in fiscal 2006 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value as compared to a gain of 13803000 in fiscal 2005 the nonstock portion of various management incentive bonus accruals decreased 18216000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

net pension costs in fiscal 2008 are expected to decrease by approximately 9000000 due primarily to the funding status and asset performance of the qualified pension plan 

interest expense 

the decrease in interest expense of 4098000 in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to decreased borrowing levels 

the increase in interest expense of 34100000 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels in fiscal 2006 commercial paper and shortterm bank borrowing rates increased over the prior year effective borrowing rates on longterm debt also increased over fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2005 effective borrowing rates on longterm debt were lowered through the use of fixedtofloating interest rate swaps higher overall borrowing levels in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 were a result of the level of share repurchases increased working capital requirements driven primarily by sales growth and continued capital investments in the form of additions to plant and equipment and acquisitions of new businesses 

other net 

changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities the increase in fiscal 2007 over the prior year is primarily due to a gain of approximately 5800000 on the sale of land 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 3825 in fiscal 2007 3935 in fiscal 2006 and 3697 in fiscal 2005 

the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to lower sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance policies 

the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was a result of increased sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2006 due to the adoption of sfas 123r and certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2005 which are discussed in note 13 sharebased compensation and note 14 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

net earnings 

net earnings increased 170 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 net earnings decreased 110 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 the changes in net earnings for these periods were due primarily to the factors discussed above as well as the impact on the comparisons due to the fiscal 2006 accounting change discussed below 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefits which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by 9285000 net of tax 

earnings per share 

basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 174 and 176 respectively in fiscal 2007 over the prior year these increases were due primary to the result of factors discussed above 

basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased 86 and 75 respectively in fiscal 2006 over the prior year these decreases were due primarily to the result of factors discussed above partially offset by a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in average shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share is primarily due to share repurchases the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to share repurchases the exclusion of certain options from the diluted share calculation due to their antidilutive effect and a modification of the treasury stock method calculation utilized to compute the dilutive effect of stock options as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r this modification results in lower diluted shares outstanding than would have been calculated had compensation cost not been recorded for stock options and stock issuances under the employees’ stock purchase plan 

segment results 

the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

 

 the following table sets forth sales and earnings before taxes of each of our reportable segments expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

 

we do not allocate sharebased compensation related to stock option grants issuances of stock pursuant to the employees’ stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants to nonemployee directors the decrease in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 is primarily attributable to reduced sharebased compensation expense and increased gains recorded related to the cash surrender value of corporateowned life insurance policies the increase in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to increased sharebased compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas 123r see further discussion of sharebased compensation in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

broadline segment 

sales for fiscal 2007 were 70 greater than fiscal 2006 the impact of eitf 0413 reduced sales growth by 04 or 173171000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a 57211000 reduction for fiscal 2006 sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which is the oneyear anniversary of the adoption of eitf 0413 acquisitions did not have an impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007 fiscal 2007 growth was due to increased sales to marketing associateserved customers and multiunit customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of our marketing associates 

the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat specialty produce and sygma operations during fiscal 2006 marketing associateserved sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us were 520 for fiscal 2007 as compared to 519 for fiscal 2006 sysco brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us were 455 for fiscal 2007 as compared to 481 for fiscal 2006 

the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increases in sales gross margin dollar increases and effective expense management 

sales for fiscal 2006 were 58 greater than fiscal 2005 the adoption of eitf 0413 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 02 acquisitions contributed 01 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 management believes that sysco’s continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of our marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2006 

the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the sygma and other segments outpacing the broadline sales growth as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat specialty produce and sygma operations during fiscal 2006 

the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2006 were primarily due to increases in sales partially offset by higher fuel costs and the continued investment in the national supply chain project 

sygma segment 

sales for fiscal 2007 were 60 greater than fiscal 2006 the impact of eitf 0413 reduced sales growth by 27 or 159236000 for fiscal 2007 compared to a 42560000 reduction for fiscal 2006 sales are reported on a comparable basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 which is the oneyear anniversary of the adoption of eitf 0413 acquisitions contributed 21 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2007 fiscal 2007 growth was due to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma’s existing customer base related to increased sales at existing locations as well as new locations added by those customers in addition certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations contributing to the sales increase 

the increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2007 was due to several factors including sales growth increased margins and improved operating efficiencies partially offset by costs of labor and auto liability related expenses in addition the transfer of customers from broadline operations referred to above also contributed to the increase in earnings before income taxes 

sales for fiscal 2006 were 103 greater than fiscal 2005 the adoption of eitf 0413 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 11 acquisitions contributed 05 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 fiscal 2006 growth was due primarily to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma’s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers each of which temporarily increases sygma’s cost to service the customers in addition certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations contributing to the sales increase 

the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2006 was due to several factors certain of sygma’s customers experienced a slowdown in their business this in turn resulted in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop in addition sygma experienced increased fuel costs startup costs related to new facilities costs incurred on information systems projects and increased workers compensation costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada we intend to continue to expand our market share through profitable sales growth foldouts and acquisitions we also strive to increase the effectiveness of our customer contact personnel and our consolidated buying programs as well as the productivity of our warehousing and distribution activities these objectives require continuing investment our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 

our operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements investments in facilities fleet and other equipment required to meet customers’ needs cash dividends and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy any remaining cash generated from operations may be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional debt our share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of longterm debt to total capitalization we target a longterm debt to total capitalization ratio between 35 and 40 the ratio may exceed the target range 

from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases this ratio was 350 and 362 as of june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 respectively for purposes of calculating this ratio longterm debt includes both the current maturities and longterm portion 

we believe that our cash flows from operations as well as the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs bank lines of credit debt shelf registration and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 

operating activities 

we generated 1402922000 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007 1124679000 in fiscal 2006 and 1191208000 in fiscal 2005 increases in our cash flow from operations are primarily due to increased earnings offset by investments in working capital 

cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was reduced by increases in inventory balances and increases in accounts receivable balances offset by an increase in accounts payable balances the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily due to sales growth the accounts payable balances did not increase at the same rate as inventory increases accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors including changes in product mix cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors due to the use of more efficient electronic payment methods 

accrued expenses increased 132936000 during fiscal 2007 increased 29161000 during fiscal 2006 and decreased 52423000 during fiscal 2005 the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased accruals for current year incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over the prior year the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2006 was related to various miscellaneous accruals the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to that year 

also affecting the increase in accrued expenses and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets during fiscal 2007 was the recording of the product liability claim of 50296000 and corresponding receivable of 48296000 cash flow from operations was not negatively affected as these items mostly offset see further discussion of the product liability claim under other considerations  

other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost net increased 14817000 during fiscal 2007 decreased 75382000 in fiscal 2006 and increased 86338000 in fiscal 2005 the change in these accounts was primarily attributable to the recording of net pension costs and the timing and amount of pension contributions to our companysponsored plans in fiscal 2007 our pension contributions exceeded the amount of net pension costs recognized during the year resulting in a net cash outflow in fiscal 2006 and 2005 the net pension costs recorded exceeded the amount of pension contributions during the year resulting in a net cash inflow 

one of the factors increasing the amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 as compared to the amounts paid in fiscal 2005 was the amount of deductible pension contributions made during the year our contributions to our defined benefit plans were 91163000 73764000 and 220361000 during fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively we expect to contribute approximately 92000000 to our defined benefit plans in fiscal 2008 also impacting taxes paid is the net cash flow impact of supply chain distribution deferrals for fiscal 2007 fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 being incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral due to increased volume through bscc 

investing activities

sysco and one of our subsidiaries sysco international co has a revolving credit facility supporting our us and canadian commercial paper programs the facility in the amount of 750000000 may be increased up to 1000000000 at our option and terminates on november 4 2011 subject to extension in the first half of fiscal 2008 we intend to increase the size of the credit facility to 1000000000 and extend the termination date by an additional year to 2012 

this facility was originally entered into in november 2005 in the amount of 500000000 and was increased to 750000000 in march 2006 in september 2006 the termination date on the facility was extended to november 4 2011 in accordance with the terms of the agreement this facility replaced the previous 450000000 us dollar and 100000000 canadian dollar revolving credit agreements in the us and canada respectively both of which were terminated in november 2005 

during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately 356804000 to 755180000 126846000 to 774530000 and 28560000 to 253384000 respectively outstanding commercial paper issuances were 531826000 as of june 30 2007 and 625308000 as of august 15 2007 

in june 2005 we repaid the 65 senior notes totaling 150000000 at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances in july 2005 we repaid the 475 senior notes totaling 200000000 at maturity also utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

in april 2005 we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering 1500000000 in debt securities the registration statement was declared effective in may 2005 in september 2005 we issued 5375 senior notes totaling 500000000 due on september 21 2035 under the april 2005 shelf registration these notes which were priced at 99911 of par are unsecured are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of september 2005 

in march 2005 we entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 350000000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate the fair value of the swap as of july 2 2005 was 32584000 which is reflected in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss net of tax in other comprehensive income loss in september 2005 in conjunction with the issuance of the 5375 senior notes described above we settled the 350000000 notional amount forwardstarting interest rate swap upon termination we paid cash of 21196000 which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination this amount is being amortized as interest expense over the 30year term of the debt and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss net of tax in other comprehensive income loss 

in may 2006 we repaid at maturity the 70 senior notes totaling 200000000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

in april 2007 we repaid at maturity the 725 senior notes totaling 100000000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

total debt as of june 30 2007 was 1780695000 of which approximately 68 was at fixed rates averaging 58 and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 52 certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders including provisions to maintain our longterm debt to total capital ratio below a specified level we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of june 30 2007 

as part of normal business activities we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements as of june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 letters of credit outstanding were 62645000 and 60000000 respectively 

other considerations 

product liability claim 

in july 2007 sysco was found contractually liable in arbitration proceedings related to a product liability claim from one of our former customers as of june 30 2007 we have recorded 50296000 on our consolidated balance sheet within accrued expenses related to the accrual of this loss also as of june 30 2007 a corresponding receivable of 48296000 is included in the consolidated balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets which represents the estimate of the loss less the 2000000 deductible on sysco’s insurance policy we have hold harmless agreements with the product suppliers and are named as an additional insured party under the suppliers’ policies with their insurers further we maintain our own product liability insurance with coverage related to this claim we believe it is probable that we will be able to recover the recorded loss from one or more of these sources 

multiemployer pension plans 

as discussed in note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering unionrepresented employees 

under current law regarding multiemployer defined benefit plans a plan’s termination our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities based on the information available from plan administrators we estimate that our share of withdrawal liability on all the multiemployer plans we participate in some of which appear to be underfunded could be as much as 120000000 

for those plans that appear to be underfunded we do not currently believe that it is probable that there will be a mass withdrawal of employers contributing to these plans or that any of the plans will terminate in the near future however required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels in addition the pension protection act enacted in august 2006 will require underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding perhaps beginning as soon as calendar 2008 unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions withdrawal liability and excise taxes could cause us to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may be required to cancel planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination of these items 

bscc cooperative structure 

our affiliate bscc is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the unites states internal revenue code we believe that the deferred tax liabilities resulting from the business operations and legal ownership of bscc are appropriate under the tax laws however if the application of the tax laws to the cooperative structure of bscc were to be successfully challenged by any federal state or local tax authority we could be required to accelerate the payment of all or a portion of our income tax liabilities associated with bscc that we otherwise have deferred until future periods and in that event would be liable for interest on such amounts as of june 30 2007 we have recorded deferred income tax liabilities of 988000000 related to the bscc supply chain distributions this amount represents the income tax liabilities related to bscc that were accrued but the payment had been deferred as of june 30 2007 in addition if the irs or any other taxing authority determines that all amounts since the inception of bscc were inappropriately deferred or that bscc should have been a taxable entity we estimate that in addition to making a current payment for amounts previously deferred as discussed above we may have liability representing interest that would be payable on the cumulative deferred balances ranging from 185000000 to 205000000 prior to federal and state income tax benefit as of june 30 2007 we calculated this amount based upon the amounts deferred since the inception of bscc applying the applicable jurisdictions’ interest rates in effect in each period during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 the irs in connection with its audit of our 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments related to the taxability of bscc we are vigorously protesting these adjustments we have reviewed the merits of the issues raised by the irs and based upon our review we believe that the resulting interest is not a probable liability and accordingly have not recorded any related amount in any period a taxing authority requiring us to accelerate the payment of these deferred tax liabilities and to pay related interest if any could cause us to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or we may have to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination of these items 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

 

 

 22 

 certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june 30 2007 included 113303000 in cash this amount is not included in the table above 

no obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of july 30 2007 we do not have a minimum funding requirement under erisa guidelines for this plan due to our previous voluntary contributions however we intend to make voluntary contributions to the qualified retirement plan totaling 80000000 during fiscal 2008 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs pension plans income taxes vendor consideration accounting for business combinations and sharebased compensation 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected in addition allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including bankruptcy accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

selfinsurance program 

we maintain a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers we also maintain a fully selfinsured group medical program liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

the measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal yearend for fiscal years 2005 and prior in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we changed the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans from fiscal yearend to may 31st to assist us in meeting accelerated sec filing dates as a result of this change we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by 9285000 net of tax with the issuance of sfas 158 see accounting changes for further discussion we have elected to early adopt the measurement date provision in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time as a result beginning in fiscal 2008 the measurement date will return to correspond with our fiscal yearend we have performed measurements as of may 31 2007 and june 30 2007 of our plan assets and benefit obligations we will record a charge to opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of 3572000 net of tax for the impact of the difference in our pension expense between the two measurement dates we will also record a benefit to opening accumulated other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of 22780000 net of tax for the impact of the difference in 

our recognition provision between the two measurement dates the measurement date used to determine fiscal 2008 net pension costs for all plans was june 30 2007 

for guidance in determining the discount rates we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate assumptions utilized impact the recorded amount of net pension costs the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2007 increased 113 to 673 from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2006 of 560 of the 56001000 decrease in net pension costs for fiscal 2007 this 113 increase in the discount rate decreased sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2007 by approximately 52576000 primarily because the higher discount rate in fiscal 2007 generated less amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the qualified pension plan retirement plan which was determined as of the june 30 2007 measurement date increased 005 to 678 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2008 net pension costs for the serp which was determined as of the june 30 2007 measurement date decreased 009 to 664 the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2008 by an estimated 480000 a 10 increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2008 would decrease sysco’s net pension cost by 19000000 while a 10 decrease in the discount rates would increase pension expense by 37000000 the impact of a 10 increase in the discount rates differ from the impact of a 10 decrease in discount rates because a 10 decrease in discount rates would require additional amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses which would not be required at our current discount rates or with a 10 increase in these rates 

we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels we used a plan specific agerelated set of rates for the retirement plan which are equivalent to a single rate of 617 as of june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 the serp assumes annual salary increases of 10 through fiscal 2007 and 7 thereafter as of june 30 2007 and july 1 2006 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 900 for fiscal 2007 and 2006 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on longterm bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 95 81 70 and 129 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2006 respectively in addition in nine of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 1000 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is 850 for fiscal 2008 a 10 increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2008 would decrease increase sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2008 by approximately 15900000 

prior to the adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas 158 minimum pension liability adjustments resulted when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets and were recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at a minimum equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation minimum pension liability adjustments were noncash adjustments that are reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an offsetting charge or benefit to shareholders’ equity net of tax through accumulated other comprehensive loss or income the amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income related to minimum pension liability was a charge net of tax of 11106000 as of july 1 2006 

the adoption of the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas 158 as of june 30 2007 resulted in the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june 30 2007 after adoption of sfas 158 was a charge net of tax of 125265000 which represented the net unrecognized actuarial losses unrecognized prior service costs and unrecognized transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of sfas 87106 as of that date 

changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plan the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions decreased net pension costs 56001000 in fiscal 2007 and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal 2008 by approximately 9000000 

we made cash contributions to our pension plans of 91163000 and 73764000 in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of 80000000 and 66000000 in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively in fiscal 2008 as in the previous years contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but we anticipate that we will make voluntary contributions of 80000000 which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2008 the estimated fiscal 2008 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other postretirement plans together are approximately 12000000 

income taxes 

the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions we establish an accrual when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable when facts and circumstances change these accruals are adjusted beginning in fiscal 2008 we will adopt fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which will change the accounting for tax positions see discussion under note 3 new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

vendor consideration 

we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized in certain of these latter instances the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco in these cases we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 

accounting for business combinations 

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 

in addition annually or more frequently as needed we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our six operating segments as described in note 17 business segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss 

sharebased compensation 

we provide compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plan and the nonemployee directors stock plan 

prior to july 3 2005 we accounted for our stock option plans and the employees’ stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided under apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and related interpretations as permitted by fasb statement no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 under which no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants and issuances of stock pursuant to the employees’ stock purchase plan however sharebased compensation expense was recognized in periods prior to fiscal 2006 and continues to be recognized for stock issuances pursuant to the management incentive plan and stock grants to nonemployee directors sharebased compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to fiscal 2006 

effective july 3 2005 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r using the modifiedprospective transition method under this transition method compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted through july 2 2005 but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of july 2 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 and b compensation cost for all share 

based payments granted subsequent to july 2 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r results for prior periods have not been restated 

as a result of adopting sfas 123r on july 3 2005 sysco’s earnings before income taxes and net earnings for fiscal 2006 were 118038000 and 105810000 lower respectively than if the company had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 basic and diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fiscal 2006 were both 017 lower than if the company had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 

as of june 30 2007 there was 82175000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 268 years 

the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans is based on the stock price less a 12 discount for postvesting restrictions the discount for postvesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 

the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 

the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan is accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period in those cases we will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in other cases certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performancebased provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate in these cases if it is probable that the performance condition will be met we recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the shorter performance period otherwise we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 

in addition certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee in these cases for awards granted prior to july 2 2005 we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires for awards granted subsequent to july 3 2005 we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 

our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option in such cases we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 

new accounting standards 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb statement no 109 sfas 109 fin 48 clarifies the application of sfas 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements additionally fin 48 provides guidance on the measurement derecognition classification and disclosure of tax positions along with accounting for the related interest and penalties the provisions of fin 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and therefore became effective for sysco on july 1 2007 while we continue to analyze the financial statement impact resulting from the adoption of fin 48 we estimate that the cumulative effect adjustment may result in an increase to tax liabilities of 70000000 to 100000000 with an offsetting charge to beginning retained earnings 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sfas 157 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities” sfas 159 sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value sfas 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas 159 may have on our consolidated financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its market share and sales longterm debt to capitalization target ratios anticipated capital expenditures expected benefits of strategic business initiatives including the timing and expected benefits of the national supply chain project and related redistribution centers the potential outcome of ongoing tax audits and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item 1a above and elsewhere in addition sysco’s ability to increase its market share and sales meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs the ability to meet longterm debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes us to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 

we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

fiscal 2007 

as of june 30 2007 we had outstanding 531826000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through september 24 2007 excluding commercial paper issuances our longterm debt obligations as of june 30 2007 of 1229969000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of june 30 2007 

in the following table as of june 30 2007 commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the us and canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as longterm based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our us and canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a longterm basis 

the following table presents our interest rate position as of june 30 2007 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

fiscal 2006 

in september 2005 we issued 5375 senior notes totaling 500000000 due on september 21 2035 in conjunction with the issuance of the 5375 senior notes we settled a 350000000 notional amount forwardstarting interest rate swap which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 

as of july 1 2006 we had outstanding 399568000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through july 3 2006 excluding commercial paper issuances our longterm debt obligations as of july 1 2006 of 1333824000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest we had no interest rate swaps outstanding as of july 1 2006 

in the following table as of july 1 2006 commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the us and canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as longterm based on the maturity date of our revolving loan agreement which supports our us and canadian commercial paper programs and our intent to continue to refinance this facility on a longterm basis 

the following table presents our interest rate position as of july 1 2006 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have canadian subsidiaries all of which use the canadian dollar as their functional currency with the exception of a financing subsidiary to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in canadian dollars we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk we will also incur gains and losses within shareholders’ equity due to translation of the financial statements from canadian dollars to us dollars our canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in us dollars which has the potential to create taxable income in canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2007 yearend exchange rate would not materially increase the tax liability associated with these notes we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 

fuel price risk 

the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home second the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers during fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 fuel costs represented approximately 06 05 and 04 of sales 

respectively fuel costs incurred by sysco increased by approximately 21225000 in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 and 48600000 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 

in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs from time to time we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements as of june 30 2007 outstanding forward diesel fuel purchase commitments totaled approximately 44500000 which will lock in the price on a substantial portion of our fuel purchases through the end of calendar year 2007

1 customers and products 

  the foodservice industry consists of two major customer types — “traditional” and “chain restaurant” traditional foodservice customers include restaurants hospitals schools hotels and industrial caterers sysco’s chain restaurant customers include regional and national hamburger sandwich pizza chicken steak and other chain operations 

  services to the company’s traditional foodservice and chain restaurant customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

  products distributed by the company include a full line of frozen foods such as meats fully prepared entrees fruits vegetables and desserts a full line of canned and dry foods fresh meats imported specialties and fresh produce the company also supplies a wide variety of nonfood items including paper products such as disposable napkins plates and cups tableware such as china and silverware cookware such as pots pans and utensils restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies and cleaning supplies sysco’s operating companies distribute nationallybranded merchandise as well as products packaged under sysco’s private brands 

  the company believes that prompt and accurate delivery of orders close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of products to traditional customers sysco’s operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through the more than 13900 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and its operating companies sysco stays informed of the needs of its customers and acquaints them with new products and services sysco’s operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

  no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for its fiscal year ended july 1 2006 

  sysco’s sales to chain restaurant customers consist of a variety of food products the company believes that consistent product quality and timely and accurate service are important factors in the selection of a chain restaurant supplier one chain restaurant customer wendy’s international inc accounted for 5 of sysco’s sales for its fiscal year ended july 1 2006 although this customer represents approximately 37 of the sygma segment sales the company does not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

  based upon available information the company estimates that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 sources of supply 

  sysco purchases from thousands of suppliers none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of the company’s purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise and independent regional brand and private label processors and packers generally purchasing is carried out through centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by the company’s various operating companies the company continually develops relationships with suppliers but has no material longterm purchase commitments with any supplier 

  in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 sysco began a project to restructure its supply chain national supply chain project this project is intended to increase profitability by lowering aggregate inventory levels operating costs and future facility expansion needs at sysco’s broadline operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 

2   the national supply chain project involved the creation of the baugh supply chain cooperative inc bscc which administers a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines the operating companies can choose to purchase product from the suppliers participating in the cooperative’s programs or from other suppliers although sysco brand products are only available to the operating companies through the cooperative’s programs 

  the national supply chain project has three major supply change initiatives actively underway the first initiative involves the construction and operation of regional distribution centers which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in the region the company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers rdcs the first of these centers the northeast rdc located in front royal virginia opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 sysco has purchased the sites for two additional rdcs the second initiative is the national transportation management initiative which provides the capability to view and manage all of sysco’s inbound freight both to rdcs and the operating companies as a network and not as individual locations the third initiative relates to inventory management software that helps sysco forecast inventory demand and manage inventories more effectively 

working capital practices 

  sysco’s growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources in management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 regarding the company’s liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

  credit terms extended by sysco to its customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on sysco’s assessment of the customers’ credit risk sysco monitors the customers’ accounts and will suspend shipments to customers if necessary 

  a majority of sysco’s sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when the customers’ orders are placed sysco will generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on product shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand sysco also makes purchases of product based on supply or pricing opportunities 

  sysco takes advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receives payment terms from its suppliers ranging from weekly to 30 days or more 

corporate headquarters’ services 

  sysco’s corporate staff makes available a number of services to the company’s operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance cash management information technology employee benefits engineering and insurance the corporate office makes available legal marketing payroll human resources information technology and tax compliance services the corporate office also makes available warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

  to maximize productivity and customer service the company continues to construct and modernize its distribution facilities during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 approximately 514751000 390203000 and 530086000 respectively were invested in facility expansions fleet additions and other capital asset enhancements the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 should be in the range of 575000000 to 625000000 during the three years ended july 1 2006 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds the company’s commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings the company expects to finance its fiscal 2007 capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

  as of july 1 2006 sysco and its operating companies had approximately 49600 fulltime employees approximately 18 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating company collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 23 of the company’s union employees expire 

3 during fiscal 2007 sysco considers its labor relations to be satisfactory during fiscal 2006 the number of customer contact associates increased 6 over the levels at the end of fiscal 2005 the company intends to continue increasing the number of customer contact associates in fiscal 2007 

competition 

  the business of sysco is competitive with numerous companies engaged in foodservice distribution foodservice operators may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets while competition is encountered primarily from local and regional distributors a few companies compete with sysco on a national basis the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices the company estimates that it serves about 14 of an approximately 232 billion annual market that includes the north american foodservice and hotel amenity furniture and textile markets sysco believes based upon industry trade data that its sales to the north american “foodpreparedawayfromhome” industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2006 while adequate industry statistics are not available the company believes that in most instances its local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas 

government regulation 

  as a marketer and distributor of food products sysco is subject to the us federal food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us food and drug administration “fda” and the canadian food and drugs act and the regulations thereunder 

  the fda regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through its manufacturing practice regulations specifies the standards of identity for certain foods and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels for certain product lines sysco is also subject to the federal meat inspection act the poultry products inspection act the perishable agricultural commodities act the packers and stockyard act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the us department of agriculture “usda” the usda imposes standards for product quality and sanitation including the inspection and labeling of meat and poultry products and the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from the company’s suppliers sysco is also subject to the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture process pack or hold food for human or animal consumption 

  in canada the canadian food inspection agency administers and enforces the food safety and nutritional quality standards established by health canada under the canadian food and drugs act and under other related federal legislation including the canada agricultural products act the meat inspection act the fish inspection act and the consumer packaging and labeling act as it relates to food these laws regulate the processing storing grading packaging marking transporting and inspection of certain sysco product lines as well as the packaging labeling sale importation and advertising of prepackaged and certain other products 

  the company and its products are also subject to state provincial and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of its facilities enforcement by state provincial and local health agencies of state provincial and local standards for the company’s products and regulation of the company’s trade practices in connection with the sale of its products sysco’s facilities are subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the us occupational safety and health act by the us department of labor together with similar occupational health and safety laws in each canadian province these regulations require the company to comply with certain manufacturing health and safety standards to protect its employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products distributed by the company 

  the company also is subject to regulation by numerous us and canadian federal state provincial and local regulatory agencies including but not limited to the us department of labor and each canadian provincial ministry of labour which set employment practice standards for workers and the us department of transportation and the canadian transportation agency which regulate transportation of perishable and hazardous materials and waste and similar state provincial and local agencies 

  most of the company’s distribution facilities have ammoniabased refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks other us and canadian federal 

4 state provincial and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment or the discharge of materials do not materially impact the company’s use or operation of its facilities 

  compliance with these laws has not had and is not anticipated to have a material effect on the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of sysco 

general 

  sysco has numerous trademarks which are of significant importance to the company the loss of the sysco ® trademark would have a material adverse effect on sysco’s results of operations 

  sysco is not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products 

  the company’s sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis therefore the business of the company is not deemed to be seasonal 

  as of july 1 2006 sysco and its operating companies operated 188 facilities throughout the united states and canada of which 171 were principal distribution facilities 




 item 1a risk factors 

low margin business inflation and economic sensitivity 

  the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup as a result sysco’s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though sysco’s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant prolonged periods of product cost inflation also may have a negative impact on the company’s profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to customers due to resistance to higher prices and the timing needed to pass on such increases the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions inflation fuel costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact sysco’s sales and operating results sysco’s operating results are also sensitive to and may be adversely affected by other factors including difficulties collecting accounts receivable competitive price pressures severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportationrelated costs although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco’s past operations there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 

increased fuel costs 

  increased fuel costs have recently had a negative impact on the company’s results of operations the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home the high cost of fuel can also increase the price paid by sysco for products as well as the costs incurred by sysco to deliver products to its customers these factors in turn negatively impact sysco’s sales margins operating expenses and operating results 

interruption of supplies and increases in product costs 

  sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products from third party suppliers for the most part sysco does not have longterm contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco although sysco’s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities and at the prices requested because sysco does not control the actual production of the products it sells it also is subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside its control these conditions include work slowdowns work interruptions strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions transportation interruptions unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events including but not limited to the outbreak of avian flu or similar foodborne illnesses in the united states and 

5 canada sysco’s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

baugh supply chain cooperative structure 

  the national supply chain project involved the creation of bscc which administers a consolidated product procurement program to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products bscc is a cooperative for income tax purposes sysco believes that the cooperative entity is appropriate for bscc based on the business operations of this affiliate and on the legal structure applied however if the application of the cooperative structure was to be disallowed by any federal state or local tax authority sysco could be required to accelerate the payment of a portion or all of its income tax liabilities that it otherwise has deferred until future periods and be liable for interest on such amounts amounts included as deferred income tax liabilities related to bscc deferred supply chain distributions were 924902000 as of july 1 2006 if sysco was required to accelerate a significant portion of these deferred tax liabilities the company may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or it may be required to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination thereof and may be required to pay interest on amounts deferred 

leverage and debt service 

  because a substantial part of sysco’s growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion sysco’s continued growth depends in large part on its ability to continue this expansion as a result its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s cash flows as well as the market value of sysco’s common stock further sysco’s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 

product liability claims 

  sysco like any other seller of food faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of sysco’s liabilities sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco’s net earnings and earnings per share 

reputation and media exposure 

  maintaining a good reputation is critical to sysco’s business particularly to selling sysco brand products anything that damages that reputation whether or not justified including adverse publicity about the quality safety or integrity of the company’s products could quickly affect its revenues and profits reports whether true or not of foodborne illnesses such as ecoli avian flu bovine spongiform encephalopathy hepatitis a trichinosis or salmonella and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure the company’s reputation if patrons of the company’s restaurant customers become ill from foodborne illnesses the customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and sysco’s sales would be correspondingly decreased in addition instances of foodborne illnesses or food tampering or other health concerns even those unrelated to the use of sysco products can result in negative publicity about the food service distribution industry and cause our sales to decrease dramatically 

labor relations and availability of qualified labor 

  as of july 1 2006 approximately 8800 employees at 55 operating companies were members of 61 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2007 16 agreements covering approximately 2000 employees will expire failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although sysco’s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and sysco believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of multiple operating subsidiaries to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on sysco 

6   sysco’s operations rely heavily on its employees particularly drivers and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect the company’s business our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity gains may not be successful and there may be a shortage of qualified drivers in future periods any such shortage would decrease sysco’s ability to effectively serve its customers such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in the company’s revenue and earnings 

charter and preferred stock 

  under its restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the existence of this undesignated preferred stock could allow the board of directors to adopt a shareholder rights plan without obtaining stockholder approval which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror as a result hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to sysco’s stockholders could be deterred 

tax audit 

  as of july 1 2006 the company’s 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns were under audit by the internal revenue service irs the company believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on these tax returns and has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions however if the irs disagrees with the positions taken by the company on its tax returns sysco could have additional tax liability including interest and penalties if material payment of such amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results and cash flows 

reliance on technology 

  sysco’s ability to decrease costs and increase profits as well as its ability to serve customers most effectively depends on the reliability of its technology network the company uses software and other technology systems to load trucks in the most efficient manner to optimize the use of storage space and minimize the time spent at each stop any disruption to these computer systems could adversely impact sysco’s customer service decrease the volume of its business and result in increased costs while sysco has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans these measures cannot fully insulate the company from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on operations and profits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend highlights 

  sales increased 78 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year gross margins as a percentage of sales were 1928 for fiscal 2006 or 018 greater as a percentage of sales than the prior year operating expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 increased from the prior year primarily due to incremental sharebased compensation expense increased fuel costs and increased pension costs partially offset by lower management performancebased incentive compensation interest expense increased in fiscal 2006 over the prior year due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was due to the combination of the adoption of sfas 123r coupled with the impact of certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of these factors net earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting change for fiscal 2006 decreased 120 over the prior year 

  the northeast redistribution center northeast rdc began operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 therefore the net impact of the national supply chain project in fiscal 2006 includes both expenses incurred by the project as well as certain direct benefits current direct benefits have been realized in the areas of cost of sales and operating expenses management estimates that expenses 

11 and direct benefits related to the national supply chain project had a net negative impact on earnings before income taxes of approximately 40000000 during fiscal 2006 

  in fiscal 2006 sysco adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas 123r utilizing the modifiedprospective transition method under which prior period results have not been restated the results of operations for fiscal 2006 include incremental sharebased compensation cost over what would have been recorded had the company continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 of 118038000 105810000 net of tax 

  sysco adopted accounting pronouncement eitf 0413 “accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty” eitf 0413 at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the accounting standard requires certain transactions where inventory is purchased by sysco from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer as defined to be presented in the income statement on a net basis the impact of adopting this new standard resulted in sales being reduced by 99803000 cost of sales were also reduced by the same amount and thus net earnings are unaffected by the adoption of this standard sysco adopted this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and will apply it to similar transactions prospectively prior year’s sales and cost of sales have not been restated therefore the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins operating expenses and earnings as a percentage of sales between the two years are affected 

  in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans to assist the company in meeting accelerated sec filing dates which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by 9285000 net of tax 

  general economic conditions including fuel costs and their impact on consumer spending can have an impact on sysco’s sales growth management believes that sysco’s continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the company’s marketing associates overcame these economic conditions and contributed to the company’s sales growth in fiscal 2006 these economic conditions may continue to be a factor to sysco’s sales growth in future periods 

overview 

  sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers sysco’s operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies specialty produce companies customcut meat operations hotel supply operations and sygma the company’s chain restaurant distribution subsidiary 

  the company estimates that it serves about 14 of an approximately 232 billion annual market that includes the north american foodservice and hotel amenity furniture and textile markets according to industry sources the foodservice or foodpreparedawayfromhome market represents approximately onehalf of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level this share grew from about 37 in 1972 to about 50 in 1998 and has not changed materially since that time 

  general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for foodpreparedawayfromhome and in turn can impact sysco’s sales sysco historically has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and has grown its market share in this fragmented industry 

  the company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include

 national supply chain project 

  the company’s national supply chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for products for sysco’s operating companies in each respective region and is expected to result in increased sales and profitability in addition it will lower inventory operating costs working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at sysco’s operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers the company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers in the united states the first of these centers the northeast rdc located in front royal virginia opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 

  during fiscal 2006 management identified a number of operational changes that they believed would make the northeast rdc more efficient and held case volumes constant while these changes were being implemented additional case volume began to flow through the northeast rdc after implementing these changes and case volumes continued to increase at a controlled and measured pace management continues to believe that the longterm economic objectives of the project will be achieved the longterm benefits expected to be realized from the national supply chain project will be reflected in the sales cost of sales operating expenses and interest expense line items in the results of operations statement 

  in january 2006 sysco completed the purchase of land in alachua florida for the future site of its second rdc which will service the company’s five broadline operating companies in florida this facility is expected to be operational in fiscal 2008 the company has also purchased the site for construction of a third rdc in hamlet indiana 

results of operations 

  the following table sets forth the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 

 13   the following table sets forth the change in the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

 sales 

  sales for fiscal 2006 were 78 greater than fiscal 2005 acquisitions contributed 14 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 and 08 for fiscal 2005 the adoption of eitf 0413 at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 03 or 99803000 sales for fiscal 2005 were 32 greater than fiscal 2004 or 53 greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004 because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2005 sales growth for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 are not directly comparable in order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by the estimated impact of the additional week as a result sales for fiscal 2004 presented in the table below are adjusted by onefourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented 

   sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers however the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify estimated product cost increases were 06 during fiscal 2006 as compared to 35 during fiscal 2005 

14   sysco’s continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the company’s marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2006 the number of customer contact personnel has increased approximately 6 since the end of fiscal 2005 

  management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general economic conditions including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending contributed to the softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of sysco’s sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal 2005 after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004 sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005 management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2005 and all of fiscal 2006 additionally management believes that the continued focus on the company’s business review process has contributed to unit sales growth 

  industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 19 in calendar year 2005 and 23 in calendar year 2004 

  a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

   a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below 

 gross margins 

  gross margins as a percentage of sales were 193 for fiscal 2006 as compared to 191 for fiscal 2005 the adoption of eitf 0413 contributed 006 to the increase in gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2006 management believes that the remaining gross margin increase was aided by several factors including low product cost inflation and effective merchandising 

  estimated product cost increases an internal measure of inflation were 06 during fiscal 2006 as compared to 35 during fiscal 2005 sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers however during periods of rapidly increasing product costs price increases to customers generally lag this lag impacted gross margins in fiscal 2005 as discussed below conversely in fiscal 2006 the moderation of product cost increases allowed sysco to be more effective in managing pricing to its customers this was achieved by maintaining stable pricing and avoiding the absorption of significant product cost increases before pricing to customers was adjusted the benefits realized by the national supply chain project and better leveraging of our purchasing power resulted in lower overall product costs 

15   gross margins as a percentage of sales were 191 for fiscal 2005 as compared to 193 for fiscal 2004 management believes that this gross margin decline was caused by several factors including product cost increases changes in segment mix customer mix and pricing pressure the decline in gross margins as a percentage of sales slowed during the course of fiscal 2005 due in part to a lessening of the rate of product cost increases during the fiscal year product cost increases in most of the product categories had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales the gross margin reduction is generally due to two reasons i the resulting higher sales dollar base impacts the comparison of the ratio between the two years and ii price increases passed on to customers lag behind the product cost increases incurred from vendors in periods of rising product costs even when gross margin dollars are maintained or slightly increased the resulting gross margin percentage of sales ratio will be lower than the prior year due to the higher sales dollar base 

  during periods of rapidly increasing product costs like those experienced in fiscal 2005 price increases to customers generally lag in the case of marketing associate served customers marketing associates will generally encounter resistance and may not be able to immediately raise prices in the case of multiunit customers prices are agreed to contractually the contracted prices are fixed for periods of up to 30 days and thus price increases to these customers will also lag the contracted prices are frequently also feebased which results in the same gross margin dollars with a higher sales price and therefore a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales 

  changes in segment mix also contributed to the decline in gross margins in fiscal 2005 when compared to the prior year sales at the sygma segment which traditionally have lower margins than broadline segment sales grew faster than sales at the broadline segment changes in customer mix also contributed to the decline in gross margins in fiscal 2005 when compared to the prior year multiunit customer sales in the broadline segment which traditionally yield lower gross margins and lower expenses than marketing associateserved customer sales grew faster and thus represented a greater percentage of total sales in fiscal 2005 than in fiscal 2004 management also believes that competitive pricing pressures contributed to the decline in gross margins 

operating expenses 

  operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling administrative and occupancy expenses changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors including improved efficiencies customer mix and product cost increases which result in increases in sales prices 

  operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 147 for fiscal 2006 as compared to 139 for fiscal 2005 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales included incremental sharebased compensation increased fuel costs increased pension costs and increased expenses associated with the national supply chain project partially offset by reduced management performance based incentive bonuses 

  operating expenses for fiscal 2006 include incremental sharebased compensation cost of 118038000 resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 fuel costs increased 48600000 fiscal 2006 over the prior year net pension costs increased 23734000 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year operating expenses were reduced by the recognition of a gain of 9702000 in fiscal 2006 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value as compared to a gain of 13803000 in fiscal 2005 management performance based incentive bonuses were reduced by 27270000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

  management estimates that expenses and direct benefits related to the national supply chain project had a net negative impact on earnings before income taxes of approximately 40000000 during fiscal 2006 direct benefits from the national supply chain project in fiscal 2006 were primarily realized in reduced cost of sales the longterm benefits expected to be realized from the national supply chain project will be reflected in the sales cost of sales operating expenses and interest expense line items in the results of operations statement 

  operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 139 for fiscal 2005 as compared to 141 for fiscal 2004 the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was aided by improved operating efficiencies for example the broadline segment continues to demonstrate improving trends in key expense metrics including miles driven per trip pieces per stop and pieces per error increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate than sales 

  operating expenses for fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by increased costs to deliver product to customers due to increased fuel costs of approximately 31000000 over the prior year operating expenses related to the national supply chain project were 46450000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to 29333000 in fiscal 2004 also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a 

16 gain of 13803000 in fiscal 2005 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value as compared to a gain of 19124000 in fiscal 2004 operating expenses were reduced by a reduction of management performance based incentive bonuses of 26989000 and a decrease in net pension cost of 7374000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

  in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco’s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july 1 2006 and july 2 2005 respectively were not material 

  net pension costs for fiscal 2007 are expected to decrease 53900000 from fiscal 2006 due primarily to an increase in the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs 

interest expense 

  the increase in interest expense of 34100000 in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was due to a combination of increased borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels 

  in fiscal 2006 commercial paper and shortterm bank borrowing rates increased over the prior year effective borrowing rates on longterm debt also increased over the comparable prior year period in fiscal 2005 effective borrowing rates on longterm debt were lowered through the use of fixedto floating interest rate swaps 

  higher overall borrowing levels are a result of the level of share repurchases increased working capital requirements driven primarily by sales growth and continued capital investments in the form of additions to plant and equipment and acquisitions of new businesses 

  the increase in interest expense of 5120000 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was due to increased borrowing interest rates the increase in the company’s overall borrowing interest rates was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of the company’s debt with fixed interest rates in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2004 the company’s debt portfolio included a larger percentage of floating rate debt in the form of either commercial paper issuances or fixed rate debt converted to floating through interest rate swap agreements in addition market interest rates increased during fiscal 2005 

other net 

  changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 

income taxes 

  the effective tax rate was 3935 in fiscal 2006 3697 in fiscal 2005 and 3850 in fiscal 2004 

  the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was a combination of the adoption of sfas 123r which is discussed in note 13 sharebased compensation and note 14 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 and certain tax benefits recorded in fiscal 2005 sysco recorded a tax benefit of 12228000 or 104 of the 118038000 in incremental sharebased compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2006 as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r 

  the income tax expense in fiscal 2005 was reduced by tax benefits totaling 19500000 primarily related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual and to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards 

net earnings 

  net earnings decreased 110 in fiscal 2006 over the prior year the decrease was due primarily to the factors discussed above in addition in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 sysco recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting due to a change in the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefits which increased net earnings for fiscal 2006 by 9285000 net of tax 

  the increases in net earnings in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 were due to the factors discussed above in addition the comparison of fiscal 2005’s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2004 

17 earnings per share 

  basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased 86 and 75 respectively in fiscal 2006 over the prior year these decreases were due primarily to the result of factors discussed above partially offset by a net reduction in shares outstanding the net reduction in average shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share is primarily due to share repurchases the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to share repurchases the exclusion of certain options from the diluted share calculation due to their antidilutive effect and a modification of the treasury stock method calculation utilized to compute the dilutive effect of stock options as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r this modification results in lower diluted shares outstanding than would have been calculated had compensation cost not been recorded for stock options and stock issuances under the employees’ stock purchase plan 

  basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 71 and 73 respectively in fiscal 2005 over prior year the increases in earnings per share were the result of factors discussed above as well as a net reduction of shares outstanding due primarily to share repurchases 

return on average shareholders’ equity 

  the return on average shareholders’ equity was approximately 30 in fiscal 2006 35 in fiscal 2005 and 39 in fiscal 2004 the lower return in fiscal 2006 was impacted by the reduction in earnings resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r as discussed above the higher return in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the impact of minimum pension liability adjustments to shareholders’ equity since its inception sysco has averaged approximately 20 return on average shareholders’ equity 

segment results 

  the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of the company’s reportable segments expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

   the following table sets forth sales and earnings before taxes of each of the company’s reportable segments expressed as a percentage of the respective consolidated total and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

   the company does not allocate sharebased compensation related to stock option grants issuances of stock pursuant to the employees’ stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants to nonemployee directors and corporate officers the increase in unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of consolidated earnings before taxes in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to these items see further discussion of sharebased compensation in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

18 broadline segment 

  sales for fiscal 2006 were 58 greater than fiscal 2005 the adoption of eitf 0413 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 02 or 57211000 sales for fiscal 2005 were 17 greater than fiscal 2004 acquisitions contributed 01 to the overall sales growth rate for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 management believes that sysco’s continued focus on customer account penetration through the use of business reviews with customers increases in the number of customer contact personnel and efforts of the company’s marketing associates contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2006 

  the fiscal 2005 sales growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associateserved customers and multiunit customers including increased sales of sysco brand products and increases in both sales prices and unit volumes the comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004 

  the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the sygma and other segments outpacing the broadline sales growth as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty meat specialty produce and sygma operations during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 

  marketing associateserved sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us remained the same at 540 in fiscal 2006 and 2005 sysco brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us decreased to 554 for fiscal 2006 as compared to 574 in fiscal 2005 

  the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2006 were primarily due to increases in sales partially offset by higher fuel costs and the continued investment in the national supply chain project 

  the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increases in sales and increased operating efficiencies aided by lower expenses as a percentage of sales factors contributing to the lower expenses as a percentage of sales were reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net periodic pension costs which overcame higher fuel costs and increased expenditures related to the national supply chain project the comparison of fiscal 2005’s earnings before income taxes to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2004 

sygma segment 

  sales for fiscal 2006 were 108 greater than fiscal 2005 the adoption of eitf 0413 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 reduced sales growth in fiscal 2006 by 11 or 42560000 sales for fiscal 2005 were 104 greater than fiscal 2004 acquisitions contributed 05 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2006 and 26 for fiscal 2005 fiscal 2006 growth was due primarily to sales to new customers and sales growth in sygma’s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers each of which temporarily increases sygma’s cost to service the customers in addition certain customers were transferred from broadline operations to be serviced by sygma operations contributing to the sales increase 

  fiscal 2005 sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers sales growth in sygma’s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers as well as increases in sales to existing locations price increases resulting primarily from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions the comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004 

  the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2006 was due to several factors certain of sygma’s customers have experienced a slowdown in their business this in turn results in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop in addition sygma has experienced increased fuel costs startup costs related to new facilities costs incurred on information systems projects and increased workers compensation costs 

  the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2005 was due to several factors during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005 sygma discontinued servicing a portion of its largest customer’s locations due to that customer’s geographic supply chain realignment sygma offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers in many cases this new business is being served out of different sygma locations than those that originally served the discontinued business sygma opened a new facility to serve a portion of the new business which it began serving in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and throughout fiscal 2005 sygma’s operating profits have been impacted by increased operating expenses as it transitioned its operations to serve the new business it has acquired in addition sygma’s gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2005 have declined from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to product cost increases and lower agreed upon pricing with its customers 

19 liquidity and capital resources 

  sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers primarily throughout the united states and canada the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth foldouts and acquisitions the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its customer contact personnel and its consolidated buying programs as well as the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities these objectives require continuing investment sysco’s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 

  sysco’s operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements investments in facilities fleet and other equipment required to meet customers’ needs cash dividends and acquisitions compatible with the company’s overall growth strategy any remaining cash generated from operations may at the discretion of management be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional longterm debt sysco’s share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans for acquisitions to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of longterm debt to total capitalization management targets a longterm debt to total capitalization ratio between 35 and 40 the ratio may exceed the target range from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases this ratio was 362 and 331 at july 1 2006 and july 2 2005 respectively for purposes of calculating this ratio longterm debt includes both the current maturities and longterm portion 

operating activities 

  cash flow from operations in fiscal 2006 was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of 119392000 and an increase in accounts receivable balances of 162586000 partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of 49775000 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of 35014000 and an increase in accounts receivable balances of 72829000 partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of 28080000 cash flow from operations in fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory balances of 162502000 and an increase in accounts receivable balances of 177058000 partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances of 95874000 

  the increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances were primarily a result of sales growth accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors including changes in product mix cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors due to the use of more efficient electronic payment methods 

  also impacting cash flow from operations was an increase in accrued expenses of 29161000 in fiscal 2006 a decrease in accrued expenses of 52423000 in fiscal 2005 and an increase in accrued expenses of 26687000 in fiscal 2004 the increase in accrued expenses for fiscal 2006 was related to various miscellaneous accruals while the changes in accrued expenses for fiscal 2005 and 2004 were primarily due to the amount of accrued incentive bonuses related to those years 

  also impacting cash flow from operations was an increase in other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost of 75382000 in fiscal 2006 and decreases of 86338000 in fiscal 2005 and 35056000 in fiscal 2004 the increases in other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost in fiscal 2006 are primarily due to the amount of net pension cost recognized exceeding the amount of pension contribution during the year the decreases in other longterm liabilities and prepaid pension cost in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are primarily due to the amount of pension contributions exceeding the net pension cost recognized in each year the company’s contributions to its defined benefit plans were 73764000 220361000 and 165512000 during fiscal 2006 fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively included in the amounts contributed in fiscal 2006 was 66000000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan representing the maximum tax deductible amount included in the amount contributed for fiscal 2005 was 134000000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter in addition to the 80000000 which was contributed during the year the decision to increase the contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure the yearend obligation which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 yearend pension funded status prior to the additional 134000000 contribution the company expects to contribute approximately 90000000 to its defined benefit plans in fiscal 2007 

20   one of the factors increasing the amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2006 as compared to the amounts paid in fiscal 2005 was the amount of deductible pension contributions made during the year as discussed above the company’s pension contributions were substantially lower in fiscal 2006 than in the preceding fiscal years 

  the amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2004 was reduced by 70615000 as the result of the utilization of a us federal net operating loss carryforward this net operating loss carryforward was generated in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain distributions

  in march 2005 sysco entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 350000000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate the fair value of the swap as of july 2 2005 was 32584000 which is reflected in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss net of tax in other comprehensive income loss in september 2005 in conjunction with the issuance of the 5375 senior notes described above sysco settled the 350000000 notional amount forwardstarting interest rate swap upon termination sysco paid cash of 21196000 which represented the fair value liability associated with the swap agreement at the time of termination this amount is being amortized as interest expense over the 30year term of the debt and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss net of tax in other comprehensive income loss 

  in may 2006 sysco repaid at maturity the 70 senior notes totaling 200000000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 

  sysco has uncommitted bank lines of credit which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to 145000000 of which 29300000 was outstanding as of july 1 2006 and 13400000 was outstanding as of august 26 2006 

  in november 2005 sysco and one of its subsidiaries sysco international co entered into a new revolving credit facility to support the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs the facility which was increased to 750000000 in march 2006 may be increased up to 1000000000 at the option of the company and terminates on november 4 2010 subject to extension the facility replaced the previous 450000000 us dollar and 100000000 canadian dollar revolving credit agreements in the us and canada respectively both of which were terminated 

  in april 2006 sysco initiated a new commercial paper program allowing the company to issue shortterm unsecured notes in aggregate not to exceed 13 billion this new commercial paper program replaced notes that were issued under sysco’s previous commercial paper program as they matured and became due and payable 

  during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and shortterm bank borrowings ranged from approximately 126846000 to 774530000 28560000 to 253384000 and 73102000 to 478114000 respectively outstanding commercial paper issuances were 399568000 as of july 1 2006 and 464917000 as of august 26 2006 

  total debt at july 1 2006 was 1762692000 of which approximately 75 was at fixed rates averaging 60 and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 52 included in current maturities of longterm debt at july 1 2006 are the 725 senior notes totaling 100000000 which mature in april 2007 it is the company’s intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through issuances of commercial paper senior notes or a combination thereof 

  as part of normal business activities sysco issues letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements as of july 1 2006 and july 2 2005 letters of credit outstanding were 60000000 and 76817000 respectively 

  sysco’s affiliate bscc is a cooperative for income tax purposes sysco believes that the cooperative entity is appropriate for bscc based on the business operations of this affiliate and on the legal structure applied however if the application of the cooperative structure was to be disallowed by any federal state or local tax authority sysco could be required to accelerate the payment of a portion or all of its income tax liabilities that it otherwise has deferred until future periods and be liable for interest on such amounts amounts included as deferred income tax liabilities related to bscc deferred supply chain distributions were 924902000 as of july 1 2006 if sysco was required to accelerate a significant portion of these deferred tax liabilities the company may be required to raise additional capital through debt financing or the issuance of equity or it may be required to forego or defer planned capital expenditures or share repurchases or a combination thereof and may be required to pay interest on amounts deferred 

22   in summary management believes that the company’s cash flows from operations as well as the availability of additional capital under its existing commercial paper programs bank lines of credit debt shelf registration and its ability to access capital from financial markets in the future will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others sysco has entered into offbalance sheet arrangements such as letters of credit which totaled 60000000 as of july 1 2006 additionally other than normal longterm noncapitalized leases included in the contractual obligations table below the company does not have any material offbalance sheet financing arrangements none of these offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on sysco’s current or future financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

contractual obligations 

  the following table sets forth certain information concerning sysco’s obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

 

   certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july 1 2006 included 147572000 in cash this amount is not included in the table above 

  no obligations were included in the table above for the qualified retirement plan because as of july 1 2006 sysco does not have a minimum funding requirements under erisa guidelines for this plan due to its previous voluntary contributions 

23 critical accounting policies 

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

  critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations these policies require management’s most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure sysco’s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs pension plans income taxes vendor consideration accounting for business combinations and sharebased compensation 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected in addition allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries the company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including bankruptcy accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods if the financial condition of sysco’s customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

selfinsurance program 

  sysco maintains a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation group medical general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience medical cost trends demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

pension plans 

  amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

  the measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years 2005 and prior beginning in fiscal 2006 the measurement date is may 31st which represents a change in accounting the onemonth acceleration of the measurement date allows additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial pension measurements in the yearend financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated filing deadlines of the securities and exchange commission the cumulative effect of this change in accounting resulted in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of 9285000 net of tax 

  for guidance in determining the discount rate sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2006 decreased 065 to 560 from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2005 of 625 this 065 decrease in the discount rate increased sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately 29300000 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2007 net pension costs which was determined as of the may 31 2006 measurement date increased 113 to 673 this 113 increase will decrease sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2007 by an estimated 53079000 

24   sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels sysco used a plan specific agerelated set of rates for the qualified pension plan retirement plan which are equivalent to a single rate of 617 and 589 respectively as of july 1 2006 and july 2 2005 the supplemental executive retirement plan assumes annual salary increases of 10 through fiscal 2007 and 7 thereafter as of july 1 2006 and july 2 2005 

  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 900 for fiscal 2006 and 2005 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on longterm bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 103 84 40 and 59 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2005 respectively in addition in nine of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 900 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

  the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs a 10 increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2007 would decrease increase sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2007 by approximately 12972000 

  minimum pension liability adjustments result when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets and are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at a minimum equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation minimum pension liability adjustments are noncash adjustments that are reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an offsetting charge or benefit to shareholders’ equity net of tax through accumulated other comprehensive loss or income amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to minimum pension liability were charges net of tax of 11106000 as of july 1 2006 and 54286000 as of july 2 2005 

  changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plan the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions increased net pension costs 23700000 in fiscal 2006 and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal 2007 by approximately 53900000 

  the company made cash contributions to its pension plans of 73764000 and 220361000 in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of 66000000 and 214000000 in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively in fiscal 2006 the company’s voluntary contribution to the retirement plan represented the maximum taxdeductible amount in fiscal 2005 the company made a voluntary contribution of 134000000 in the fourth quarter in addition to the 80000000 which was contributed during the year the decision to increase the contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure the yearend obligation which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 yearend pension funded status prior to the additional 134000000 contribution in fiscal 2007 as in the previous years contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions of approximately 80000000 which is not greater than the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2007 the estimated fiscal 2007 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other postretirement plans together are approximately 10000000 

income taxes 

  the determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws the company’s provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

  in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions the company establishes an accrual when despite management’s belief that the company’s tax return positions are supportable management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable when facts and circumstances change these accruals are adjusted 

25 vendor consideration 

  sysco recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances sysco will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases sysco will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized in certain of these latter instances the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco in these cases sysco classifies the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 

accounting for business combinations 

  goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit in addition sysco assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss 

sharebased compensation 

  sysco provides compensation benefits to employees and nonemployee directors under several sharebased payment arrangements including various employee stock option plans the employees’ stock purchase plan the management incentive plans and the nonemployee directors stock plan 

  prior to july 3 2005 sysco accounted for its stock option plans and the employees’ stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided under apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb 25 and related interpretations as permitted by fasb statement no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 under which no compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants and issuances of stock pursuant to the employees’ stock purchase plan however sharebased compensation expense was recognized in periods prior to fiscal 2006 and continues to be recognized for stock issuances pursuant to the management incentive plans and stock grants to nonemployee directors sharebased compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to fiscal 2006 

  effective july 3 2005 sysco adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r using the modifiedprospective transition method under this transition method compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted through july 2 2005 but for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of july 2 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to july 2 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r results for prior periods have not been restated 

  as a result of adopting sfas 123r on july 3 2005 sysco’s earnings before income taxes and net earnings for fiscal 2006 were 118038000 and 105810000 lower respectively than if the company had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 basic and diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fiscal 2006 were both 017 lower than if the company had continued to account for sharebased compensation under apb 25 

  as of july 1 2006 there was 112111000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to sharebased compensation arrangements that cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 272 years 

  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco’s stock implied volatilities from traded options on sysco’s stock and other factors sysco utilizes historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model separate 

26 groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes the riskfree rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 

  the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans is based on the stock price less a 12 discount for postvesting restrictions the discount for postvesting restrictions is estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 

  the compensation cost related to these sharebased awards is recognized over the requisite service period the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 

  the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plans is accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus relates the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees’ stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 

  certain of sysco’s option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period in those cases sysco will recognize compensation cost on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in other cases certain of sysco’s option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performancebased provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate in these cases if it is probable that the performance condition will be met sysco recognizes compensation cost on a straightline basis over the shorter performance period otherwise it recognizes compensation cost over the probable longer service period 

  in addition certain of sysco’s options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee in these cases for awards granted prior to july 2 2005 sysco will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires for awards granted subsequent to july 3 2005 sysco will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 

new accounting standards 

  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no ftb 8541 “accounting for life settlement contracts by thirdparty investors” fsp ftb 8541 in march 2006 which allows an investor to account for its investments in a life settlement contract using either the investment method or the fair value method the investment method requires the initial investment to be recognized at the transaction price while the fair value method requires the initial investment to be recognized at its transaction price and remeasured to fair value each subsequent reporting period this standard was adopted by the fasb to address volatility concerns when underlying investments are maintained in the stock market the election of the investment method or fair value method is irrevocable and should be made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis previously only the fair value method was available fsp ftb 8541 is effective for sysco in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 prospective application is required for all new investments in life settlement contracts and a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings should be made at the date of adoption to recognize the impact on existing life settlement contract investments sysco will adopt fsp ftb 8541 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the investment method which will result in a cumulative change in accounting principle charge of approximately 39735000 

  in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb statement no 109 sfas 109 fin 48 clarifies the application of sfas 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements additionally fin 48 provides guidance on the measurement derecognition classification and disclosure of tax positions along with accounting for the related interest and penalties the provisions of fin 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings sysco is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of fin 48 will have on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

27 forwardlooking statements 

  certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its market share and sales longterm debt to capitalization target ratios anticipated capital expenditures timing and expected benefits of the national supply chain project and related regional distribution centers the potential outcome of ongoing tax audits and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

  these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above in addition sysco’s ability to increase its market share and sales meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses including fuel costs the ability to meet longterm debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes sysco’s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes the company to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

  sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

  in september 2005 sysco issued 5375 senior notes totaling 500000000 due on september 21 2035 in conjunction with the issuance of the 5375 senior notes sysco settled a 350000000 notional amount forwardstarting interest rate swap which was designated as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 

  at july 1 2006 the company had outstanding 399568000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through july 3 2006 the company’s total longterm debt obligations of 1733392000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest the company had no interest rate swaps outstanding at july 1 2006 

  in the following table as of july 1 2006 commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and both the us and canadian commercial paper issuances outstanding are classified as longterm based on the maturity date of the company’s revolving loan agreement which supports the company’s us and canadian commercial paper programs and the company’s intent to continue to refinance this facility on a longterm basis 

  the following table presents the company’s interest rate position as of july 1 2006 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 28   at july 2 2005 the company had 157851000 of commercial paper outstanding at variable rates of interest with maturities through july 29 2005 the company’s total longterm debt obligations of 1367110000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest 

  at that time management believed that present market conditions reflected fixed long term rates near historical lows as such management believed that fixed long term rates presented a better opportunity than in the recent past and had the intent to issue between 350000000 and 500000000 of long term debt at fixed rates with extended terms in september 2005 the amount to be issued depending upon market conditions at the time of issuance in march 2005 sysco entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 350000000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on 350000000 of the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate the issuance of this longterm debt in fiscal 2006 is discussed above 

  during part of fiscal 2005 sysco had several fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding these were entered into in fiscal 2004 as management believed that floating interest rates were more advantageous during fiscal 2005 sysco terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding locking in effective yields on the related debt 

  in the following tables as of july 2 2005 commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and the us commercial paper is classified as longterm based on the maturity date of the company’s revolving loan agreement which supports the company’s us commercial paper program and the company’s intent to continue to refinance this facility on a longterm basis 

  the following tables present the company’s interest rate position as of july 2 2005 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

   

rate a — sixmonth libor in advance 

  the company has canadian subsidiaries all of which use the canadian dollar as their functional currency with the exception of a financing subsidiary to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in canadian dollars the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk sysco will also incur gains and losses within shareholders’ equity due to translation of the financial statements from canadian dollars to us dollars the canadian financing subsidiary has notes denominated in us dollars which has the potential to create taxable income in canada when the debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date a 10 unfavorable change in the fiscal 2006 year end exchange rate would not materially increase the tax liability associated with these notes the company does not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency risks 

29   the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home second the high cost of fuel can increase the price paid by sysco for product purchases for which sysco may not be able to pass these costs fully to its customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs incurred by sysco to deliver product to its customers during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 fuel costs represented approximately 05 04 and 03 of sales respectively fuel costs incurred by sysco in fiscal 2006 increased by approximately 48600000 over fiscal 2005 

  in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco’s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july 1 2006 were not material

customers and products 

the foodservice industry consists of two major customer types — “traditional” and “chain restaurant” traditional foodservice customers include restaurants hospitals schools hotels and industrial caterers sysco’s chain restaurant customers include regional and national hamburger sandwich pizza chicken steak and other chain operations 

services to the company’s traditional foodservice and chain restaurant customers are supported by similar physical facilities vehicles material handling equipment and techniques and administrative and operating staffs 

products distributed by the company include a full line of frozen foods such as meats fully prepared entrees fruits vegetables and desserts a full line of canned and dry foods fresh meats imported specialties and fresh produce the company also supplies a wide variety of nonfood items including paper products such as disposable napkins plates and cups tableware such as china and silverware cookware such as pots pans and utensils restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies and cleaning supplies sysco’s operating companies distribute both nationallybranded merchandise and products packaged under sysco’s private brands 

the company believes that prompt and accurate delivery of orders close contact with customers and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of products to traditional customers sysco’s operating companies offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice through the more than 13200 sales and marketing representatives and support staff of sysco and its operating companies sysco stays informed of the needs of its customers and acquaints them with new products and services sysco’s operating companies also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data menuplanning advice food safety training and assistance in inventory control as well as access to various third party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of sysco’s total sales for its fiscal year ended july 2 2005 

sysco’s sales to chain restaurant customers consist of a variety of food products the company believes that consistent product quality and timely and accurate service are important factors in the selection of a chain restaurant supplier one chain restaurant customer wendy’s international inc accounted for 5 of sysco’s sales for its fiscal year ended july 2 2005 although this customer represents approximately 39 of the sygma segment sales the company does not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 

based upon available information the company estimates that sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows 

 

sources of supply 

sysco purchases from thousands of suppliers none of which individually accounts for more than 10 of the company’s purchases these suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise and independent regional brand and private label processors and packers generally purchasing is carried out through centrally developed purchasing programs and direct purchasing programs established by the company’s various operating companies the company continually develops relationships with suppliers but has no material longterm purchase commitments with any supplier 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 sysco began restructuring its supply chain this national supply chain project which reorganizes sysco’s supply chain involved the creation of the baugh supply chain cooperative that handles product procurement and also involves the construction and operation of regional distribution centers which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco operating companies in the region the company’s national supply chain project is intended to increase profitability by lowering aggregate inventory levels operating costs and future facility expansion needs at sysco’s operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers the company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers over the next seven years the first of these centers the northeast redistribution center located in front royal virginia opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 as of august 2005 it was supplying products to 12 of the 14 broadline operating companies in the northeast region and is expected to be shipping products to the remaining two operating companies in the northeast region by october 2005 the company expects to begin construction of its second regional 

redistribution facility to be located in alachua florida in fiscal 2006 the third regional redistribution center is planned to be located in the midwest region 

the baugh supply chain cooperative administers a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop obtain and ensure consistent quality food and nonfood products the program covers the purchasing and marketing of sysco brand merchandise as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers encompassing substantially all product lines the operating companies can choose to purchase product from the suppliers participating in the cooperative’s programs or from other suppliers but sysco brand products are only available through the cooperative’s programs 

working capital practices 

sysco’s growth is funded through a combination of cash flow from operations commercial paper issuances and longterm borrowings see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources in management’s discussion and analysis in item 7 regarding the company’s liquidity financial position and sources and uses of funds 

credit terms extended by sysco to its customers can vary from cash on delivery to 30 days or more based on sysco’s assessment of the customers’ credit risk sysco monitors the customers’ accounts and will suspend shipments to customers if necessary 

a majority of sysco’s sales are filled within 24 hours of when the customers’ orders are placed sysco will maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand the level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on product shelflife supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand sysco also makes purchases of product based on supply or pricing opportunities 

sysco takes advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate and otherwise generally receives payment terms from its suppliers payment terms received from suppliers range from weekly to 30 days or more 

corporate headquarters’ services 

sysco’s corporate staff makes available a number of services to the company’s operating companies members of the corporate staff possess experience and expertise in among other areas accounting and finance cash management information technology employee benefits engineering and insurance the corporate office also makes available legal marketing payroll human resources and tax compliance services as well as warehousing and distribution services which provide assistance in space utilization energy conservation fleet management and work flow 

capital improvements 

to maximize productivity and customer service the company continues to construct and modernize its distribution facilities during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 390203000 530086000 and 435637000 respectively were invested in facility expansions fleet additions and other capital asset enhancements the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 should be in the range of 425000000 to 450000000 during the three years ended july 2 2005 capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds the company’s commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings the company expects to finance its fiscal 2006 capital expenditures from the same sources 

employees 

as of july 2 2005 sysco and its operating companies had approximately 47500 fulltime employees approximately 18 of whom were represented by unions primarily the international brotherhood of teamsters contract negotiations are handled locally collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 27 of the company’s union employees expire during fiscal 2006 sysco considers its labor relations to be satisfactory during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the number of customer contact associates increased by almost 2 as compared to the number at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005 the company intends to continue to increase the number of customer contact associates in fiscal 2006 

competition 

the business of sysco is competitive with numerous companies engaged in foodservice distribution foodservice operators may also choose to purchase products directly from retail outlets while competition is encountered primarily from local and regional distributors a few companies compete with sysco on a national basis the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and a competitive price the company estimates that it serves about 14 of an approximately 210 billion annual market that includes the north american foodservice and hotel amenity furniture and textile markets sysco 

believes based upon industry trade data that its sales to the north american “foodpreparedawayfromhome” industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2005 while adequate industry statistics are not available the company believes that in most instances its local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

highlights 

sales increased 32 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 fiscal 2005 included 52 weeks as compared to fiscal 2004 which included an additional 53 rd week after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004 sales increased 53 in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 adjusted sales see the reconciliation of fiscal 2004 actual sales to fiscal 2004 adjusted sales in “ sales” under “results of operations” gross margins as a percent of sales for fiscal 2005 decreased from the prior year due to the impact of product cost increases and changes in customer mix and segment mix operating expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal 2005 decreased from the prior year due to operating efficiencies operating costs increasing at lower rates than sales price increases reduced performancebased management incentive compensation and decreased net pension costs which overcame increased fuel costs and increased expenses incurred on the national supply chain project the income tax provision in fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of 85 million primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of 11 million related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual the comparison of fiscal 2005’s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by the additional 53 rd week in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of these factors net earnings for fiscal 2005 increased 60 over the prior year 

management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general economic conditions including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending contributed to a softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of sysco’s sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal 2005 after adjusting for the additional week in last year’s fourth quarter sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005 management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth experienced in the latter half of fiscal 2005 additionally management believes that the maturation of the company’s business review process has contributed to unit sales growth 

the company continues to focus on customer account penetration and expense controls including managing personnel expenses improving productivity and ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies 

overview 

sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging establishments and other foodservice customers sysco’s operations are located throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies specialty produce companies customcut meat operations asian cuisine foodservice operations hotel supply operations and sygma the company’s chain restaurant distribution subsidiary 

the company estimates that it serves about 14 of an approximately 210 billion annual market that includes the north american foodservice and hotel amenity furniture and textile markets according to industry sources the foodservice or foodpreparedawayfromhome market represents approximately onehalf of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level this share grew from about 37 in 1972 to its current level in 1998 

general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency and amount spent by consumers for foodpreparedawayfromhome and in turn can impact sysco’s sales sysco historically has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and has grown its market share in this fragmented industry 

the company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow earnings through strategies which include 

 

 

the company’s national supply chain project is intended to optimize the supply chain activities for products for sysco’s operating companies in each respective region and as a result increase profitability and lower inventory and operating costs working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at sysco’s operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers the company expects to build from seven to nine regional distribution centers in the united states over the next seven years the first of these centers the northeast redistribution center located in front royal virginia opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 as of august 2005 it was supplying products to 12 of the 14 broadline operating companies in the northeast region and is expected to be shipping products to the remaining two operating companies in the northeast region by october 2005 the company expects to begin construction of its second regional redistribution facility to be located in alachua florida in fiscal 2006 

the expenses related to the national supply chain project in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 are expected to be approximately equal to expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 or about 15 million during the first half of fiscal 2006 the rampup phase of the northeast redistribution center will be completed it is anticipated that the majority of benefits that will be realized in fiscal 2006 from the northeast redistribution center will be realized during the second half of fiscal 2006 as this is when the northeast redistribution center is expected to be operating at full volume 

hurricane katrina 

hurricane katrina principally impacted our operating companies in jackson mississippi and new orleans louisiana as well as causing many of our customers in the new orleans and mississippi gulf coast area to be closed the impacted operations in jackson have recovered and service to customers has been restored sysco’s facility in new orleans sustained only minor damage from the storm but remained closed after the storm due to conditions in new orleans the facility has recently resumed partial operations however most of the orders received from customers of the new orleans facility that are open for business have been temporarily rerouted to other nearby sysco facilities for fulfillment and delivery until the new orleans facility has been restored to full capacity we are still assessing the impact of hurricane katrina on our operations in the areas affected by the storm however we do not expect this occurrence to have a material adverse effect on sysco’s financial position or fiscal 2006’s operating results as a whole 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 

 

the following table sets forth the change in the components of the results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year 

 

sales 

sales for fiscal 2005 were 32 greater than fiscal 2004 or 53 greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004 sales for fiscal 2004 were 122 greater than fiscal 2003 or 100 greater after adjusting for the additional week in fiscal 2004 because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003 sales growth for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 are not directly comparable in order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by the estimated impact of the additional week as a result sales for fiscal 2004 presented in the table below are adjusted by onefourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth for the periods presented 

 

acquisitions contributed 08 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 09 for fiscal 2004 sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its customers however the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price increases is difficult to quantify estimated product cost increases were 35 during fiscal 2005 as compared to 63 during fiscal 2004 

management believes that prolonged periods of rising product costs together with general economic conditions including the impact of increased fuel costs on consumer spending contributed to the softness in the foodservice market and thus a slowing of sysco’s sales growth beginning in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and continuing into the first half of fiscal 2005 

after adjusting for the additional week in last year’s fourth quarter sales growth remained relatively stable over the course of fiscal 2005 management believes that the declining rate of product cost increases over the course of fiscal 2005 has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced during the year and has contributed to the underlying unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2005 additionally management believes that the maturation of the company’s business review process has contributed to unit sales growth 

the company also continues its focus on profitable sales growth one part of this strategy involves being more selective with respect to which customers we serve including improving the profitability of or ultimately exiting unprofitable customers and refining the use of customer purchasing potential and profitability data in targeting new customers the company continues to see reductions in sales to unprofitable customers over the comparable prior year periods in addition the number of customer contact personnel increased almost 2 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the number at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005 the company intends to continue to increase the number of customer contact associates in fiscal 2006 

industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real sales growth of approximately 24 in calendar year 2004 and real sales decline of approximately 01 in calendar year 2003 

a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below 

 

a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below 

 

gross margins 

gross margins as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2005 when compared to the prior year management believes that this gross margin decline was caused by several factors including product cost increases changes in segment mix customer mix and pricing pressure product cost increases in most of the product categories had the impact of reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales as gross profit dollars are earned on a higher sales dollar base the decline in gross margins as a percent of sales slowed during the course of fiscal 2005 due in part to a lessening of the rate of product cost increases during the fiscal year

operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling administrative and occupancy expenses changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors including improved efficiencies customer mix and product cost increases which result in increases in sales prices 

the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was aided by improved operating efficiencies for example the broadline segment continues to demonstrate improving trends in key expense metrics including miles driven per trip pieces per stop and pieces per error increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate 

operating expenses were negatively impacted by increased costs to deliver product to customers due to increased fuel costs of approximately 31000000 in fiscal 2005 over the prior year operating expenses related to the national supply chain project were 46450000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to 29333000 in fiscal 2004 also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a gain of 13803000 in fiscal 2005 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value as compared to a gain of 19124000 in fiscal 2004 operating expenses were favorably impacted by a reduction of management performance based incentive bonuses of 26989000 and a decrease in net pension cost of 7374000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

the decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to several factors including improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics tracked at the broadline operating companies including pieces sold per delivery product line items sold per delivery pieces per trip and pieces per error increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as operating costs increased at a lower rate operating expenses were negatively impacted by increases in net pension costs of 39944000 and by increases in expenses related to the national supply chain project of 5584000 over fiscal 2003 also included in operating expenses was the recognition of a gain of 19124000 in fiscal 2004 to adjust the carrying value of life insurance assets to their cash surrender value as compared to a loss of 156000 in fiscal 2003 

in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco’s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july 2 2005 were not material 

interest expense 

the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2005 was due to increased borrowing interest rates the increase in the company’s overall borrowing interest rates was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of the company’s debt with fixed interest rates in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2004 the company’s debt portfolio included a larger percentage of floating rate debt in the form of either commercial paper issuances or fixed rate debt converted to floating through interest rate swap agreements in addition market interest rates have increased during fiscal 2005 

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower borrowing interest rates offsetting moderately higher borrowing levels the lower average borrowing rates of the company in fiscal 2004 were due to lower shortterm market interest rates and the use of interest rate swaps which converted the fixed rates of interest on a portion of sysco’s long term debt to lower variable rates of interest 

other net 

changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 3697 in fiscal 2005 3850 in fiscal 2004 and 3825 in fiscal 2003 the income tax provision in fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of 8500000 primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain state net operating loss carryforwards and a tax benefit of 11000000 related to the reversal of a tax contingency accrual 

net earnings 

fiscal 2005 represents the twentyninth consecutive year of increased earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes the increases were due to the factors discussed above in addition the comparison of fiscal 2005’s net earnings to fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by the additional 53 rd week in fiscal 2004 

earnings per share 

the increases in earnings per share were the result of factors discussed above as well as a net reduction of shares outstanding due primarily to share repurchases 

return on average shareholders’ equity 

the return on average shareholders’ equity was approximately 35 in fiscal 2005 39 in fiscal 2004 and 36 in fiscal 2003 the higher return in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the impact of minimum pension liability adjustments to shareholders’ equity since its inception sysco has averaged approximately 20 return on average shareholders’ equity

broadline segment 

acquisitions contributed 01 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 02 in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2005 sales growth was primarily due to increased sales to marketing associateserved customers and multiunit customers including increased sales of sysco brand products and increases in both sales prices and unit volumes the comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004 

the fiscal 2004 sales growth was due to increased sales to marketing associateserved customers and multiunit customers including increased sales of sysco brand products and price increases resulting from higher product costs the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004 the sales growth in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was obtained through increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers 

the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal 2005 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the sygma and other segments outpacing the broadline sales growth as well as the contributions to sales growth from the acquisitions of specialty produce and sygma operations during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 the decrease of broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales in fiscal 2004 was due primarily to strong sales growth in the sygma and other segments outpacing the broadline sales growth as well as the contribution to sales growth from the acquisition of the asian cuisine foodservice operations during fiscal 2003 

marketing associateserved sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us increased to 538 in fiscal 2005 as compared to 535 in fiscal 2004 sysco brand sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the us decreased to 494 for fiscal 2005 as compared to 495 in fiscal 2004 

the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increases in sales and increased operating efficiencies aided by lower expenses as a percentage of sales factors contributing to the lower expenses as a percentage of sales were reduced performance based management incentive compensation and decreased net periodic pension costs which overcame higher fuel costs and increased expenditures related to the national supply chain project the comparison of fiscal 2005’s earnings before income taxes to fiscal 2004 was also negatively impacted by the additional 53 rd week in fiscal 2004 

the increase in earnings before income taxes for fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increased sales and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales which more than offset reduced margins as a percentage of sales the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004 

sygma segment 

acquisitions contributed 26 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2005 and 19 in fiscal 2004 the comparison of fiscal 2005 sales to fiscal 2004 is negatively impacted by the additional week in fiscal 2004 both the fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 sales growth was due primarily to sales to new customers sales growth in sygma’s existing customer base related to new locations added by those customers as well as increases in sales to existing locations price increases resulting primarily from higher product costs and sales from acquisitions the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004 

the decrease in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2005 was due to several factors during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005 sygma discontinued servicing a portion of its largest customer’s locations due to that customer’s geographic supply chain realignment sygma offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this customer and obtaining new business from other customers in many cases this new business is being served out of different sygma locations than those that originally served the discontinued business sygma opened a new facility to serve a portion of the new business which it began serving in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and throughout fiscal 2005 sygma’s operating profits have been impacted by increased operating expenses as it transitioned its operations to serve the new business it has acquired in addition sygma’s gross margins as a percent of sales in fiscal 2005 have declined from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to product cost increases and lower agreed upon pricing with its customers 

the increase in earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the increased sales offset by increased expenses incurred related to implementation of new systems severance payments related to certain personnel changes costs related to worker’s compensation insurance claims and pension costs the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004 

liquidity and capital resources

sysco’s operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements investments in facilities fleet and other equipment required to meet customers’ needs cash dividends and acquisitions compatible with the company’s overall growth strategy any remaining cash generated from operations may at the discretion of management be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional longterm debt sysco’s share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans for acquisitions to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of longterm debt to total capitalization management targets a longterm debt to total capitalization ratio between 35 and 40 the ratio may exceed the target range from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases this ratio was 331 and 352 at july 2 2005 and july 3 2004 respectively for purposes of calculating this ratio longterm debt includes both the current maturities and longterm portion

also during the fall of 2005 the company intends to renegotiate its revolving bank credit facility which supports the us commercial paper program 

operating activities

during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers the structure results in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments as supply chain distributions are not included in taxable income until distributed in periods subsequent to when they are recognized in book income fiscal 2004 is the first period that supply chain distributions were included in taxable income since the company began deferring these items for tax purposes in fiscal 2002 as a result of the impact of these items and other temporary differences including the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards excess tax depreciation and pension contributions taxes paid during fiscal 2005 and 2004 increased to 436378000 and 344414000 respectively as compared to 28747000 in fiscal 2003 the net cash flow impact of supply chain distribution deferrals in fiscal 2005 was incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral due to increased volume through this structure 

the amount of taxes paid in fiscal 2004 was reduced by 70615000 as the result of the utilization of a us federal net operating loss carryforward this net operating loss carryforward was generated in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the deferral of supply chain distributions

in march 2005 sysco entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 350000000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate the fair value of the swap as of july 2 2005 was 32584000 which is reflected in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss net of tax in other comprehensive income

from august 1 2005 through august 27 2005 outstanding commercial paper issuances have averaged 511847000 this increased level of commercial paper issuances is primarily a result of the repayment of the 65 senior notes and 475 senior notes which matured june 15 2005 and july 30 2005 respectively coupled with a contribution to the qualified pension plan of 134000000 at the end of fiscal 2005 as described above the company intends to issue longterm debt in september 2005 until such time sysco believes that outstanding commercial paper issuances will continue at these current levels the company expects to continue to meet its capital investment and working capital requirements during this period the company also believes that it continues to have access to additional debt financing if needed

in summary management believes that the company’s cash flows from operations as well as the availability of capital under its existing commercial paper programs bank lines of credit debt shelf registration and its ability to access capital from financial markets in the future will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information concerning sysco’s obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments 

 

 

 certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july 2 2005 included approximately 1059000 shares of sysco’s common stock and 105614000 in cash these amounts are not included in the table above 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 

critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations these policies require management’s most subjective or complex judgments often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure sysco’s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs pension plans income taxes vendor consideration and accounting for business combinations 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected in addition allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries the company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including bankruptcy accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods if the financial condition of sysco’s customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 

selfinsurance program 

sysco maintains a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation group medical general liability and vehicle liability costs the amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party insurers liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers’ compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 

pension plans 

amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 

the measurement date for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is fiscal year end for fiscal years 2005 and prior beginning in fiscal 2006 the measurement date will be may 31 st which represents a change in accounting the onemonth acceleration of the measurement date will allow additional time for management to evaluate and report the actuarial pension measurements in the yearend financial statements and disclosures within the accelerated filing deadlines of the securities and exchange commission the cumulative effect of this change in accounting is expected to result in an increase to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 of approximately 9400000 net of tax 

for guidance in determining the discount rate sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of highquality fixedincome investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plans the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2005 increased 025 to 625 from the discount rate utilized to determine net pension costs for fiscal 2004 of 600 this 025 increase in the discount rate decreased sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2005 by approximately 9500000 the discount rate for determining fiscal 2006 net pension costs which was determined as of the may 31 2005 measurement date decreased 065 to 560 this 065 decrease will increase sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately 29300000 

sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels sysco used a plan specific agerelated set of rates equivalent to a single rate of 589 for the qualified pension plan retirement plan as of july 2 2005 and july 3 2004 the supplemental executive retirement plan assumes annual salary increases of 10 through fiscal 2007 and 7 thereafter as of july 2 2005 and july 3 2004 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was 900 for fiscal 2005 and 2004 the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on longterm bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets although not determinative of future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 109 103 33 and 123 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31 2004 respectively in addition in nine of the last 15 years the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 900 the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 

the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs a 10 increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2006 would decrease increase sysco’s net pension costs for fiscal 2006 by approximately 11600000 

minimum pension liability adjustments are recorded so that the recorded pension liability is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation minimum pension liability adjustments are noncash adjustments that are reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an offsetting charge or benefit to shareholders’ equity net of tax through comprehensive loss or income amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to minimum pension liability were charges net of tax of 54286000 as of july 2 2005 and 20733000 as of july 3 2004 

changes in the assumptions including changes to the discount rate discussed above together with the normal growth of the plan the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions decreased net pension costs 7374000 in fiscal 2005 and is expected to increase net pension costs in fiscal 2006 by approximately 23700000 

the company made cash contributions to its pension plans of 220361000 and 165512000 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of 214000000 and 160000000 in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively included in the amounts contributed in fiscal 2005 was 134000000 voluntarily contributed to the qualified pension plan in the fourth quarter the decision to increase the contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the decreased discount rate which increased the pension obligation and negatively impacted the fiscal 2005 yearend pension funded status in fiscal 2006 as in the previous years contributions to the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary contributions of approximately 66000000 which is the estimated maximum amount that will be tax deductible in fiscal 2006 the estimated fiscal 2006 contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other postretirement plans together are approximately 7997000 

income taxes 

the determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws the company’s provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state as well as canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions jurisdictional tax law changes increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 

in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions the company establishes an accrual when despite management’s belief that the company’s tax return positions are supportable management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable when facts and circumstances change these accruals are adjusted 

vendor consideration 

sysco recognizes consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors in many instances the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound in these instances sysco will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases sysco will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete the related service is performed and the amounts realized in certain of these latter instances the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco in these cases sysco classifies the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognizes these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 

accounting for business combinations 

goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit in addition sysco assesses the 

recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing an impairment loss 

new accounting standards 

on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123r which is a revision of sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123 sfas 123r supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb opinion 25 and amends sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows” generally the approach in sfas 123r is similar to the approach described in sfas 123 however sfas 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 

sysco will adopt sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 sfas 123r allows for two transition methods the basic difference between the two methods is that the modifiedprospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods whereas the modifiedretrospective transition method will require restatement 

as permitted by sfas 123 the company currently accounts for sharebased payments to employees using apb opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and as such generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan although the full impact of the company’s adoption of sfas 123r’s fair value method has not yet been determined the company expects that it will have a significant impact on its results of operations the disclosure in the footnotes to the company’s consolidated financial statements under stockbased compensation of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company had recognized compensation cost for sharebased payments under sfas 123 for periods prior to fiscal 2006 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for sharebased payments under sfas 123r in future periods the company estimates that the earnings per share impact to fiscal 2006 resulting from recording compensation expense related to stock options and the employees’ stock purchase plan will be approximately 011 to 013 the potential impact of adopting sfas 123r on fiscal 2006’s results of operations and earnings per share is dependent on several factors including the number of options granted in fiscal 2006 the fair value of those options which will be determined at the date of grant the level of participation in the employees’ stock purchase plan the related income tax benefits recorded and the diluted shares outstanding this estimate is based on certain assumptions as to these factors and the actual impact may differ if actual results vary from the assumptions 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” a replacement of apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” the standard changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle requiring a retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of the change in principle unless it is impracticable rather than the recording of a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in net income in the year of change the standard is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 

risk factors 

low margin business inflation and economic sensitivity 

the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup as a result sysco’s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though sysco’s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant prolonged periods of product cost inflation also may have a negative impact on the company’s profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to customers due to resistance to higher prices the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions inflation fuel costs and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact sysco’s sales and operating results sysco’s operating results are also sensitive to and may be adversely affected by other factors including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable competitive price pressures severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportationrelated costs although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco’s past operations there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 

increased fuel costs 

increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home the high cost of fuel can also increase the price paid by sysco for product as well as the costs incurred by sysco to deliver product to its customers these factors in turn may negatively impact sysco’s sales margins operating expenses and operating results 

interruption of supplies and increases in product costs 

sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products from third party suppliers for the most part sysco does not have longterm contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco although sysco’s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities and at the prices requested because sysco does not control the actual production of the products it sells it also is subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside its control these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions transportation interruptions increases in fuel costs competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events sysco’s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers and customers may turn to other distributors 

leverage and debt service 

because a substantial part of sysco’s growth historically has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion sysco’s continued growth depends in large part on its ability to continue this expansion as a result its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand moreover any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of sysco’s common stock further sysco’s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 

product liability claims 

sysco like any other seller of food faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or if available may not be adequate to cover all of sysco’s liabilities sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco’s net earnings and earnings per share 

labor relations 

as of july 2 2005 approximately 8700 employees at 54 operating companies were members of 61 different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2006 16 agreements covering approximately 2400 employees will expire failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages although sysco’s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and sysco believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on sysco 

integration of acquired companies 

if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner its profitability may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise or with a corporate culture different from sysco’s if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base in addition the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management’s attention from sysco’s existing business and may damage sysco’s relationships with its key customers and suppliers 

charter and stockholder rights plan 

under its restated certificate of incorporation sysco’s board of directors is authorized to issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco 

without approval of the board of directors depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco pursuant to its stockholder rights plan which could result in substantial dilution to a potential acquiror the existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to sysco’s stockholders 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management’s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 they include statements about sysco’s ability to increase its market share and sales longterm debt to capitalization target ratios anticipated capital expenditures timing and expected benefits of the national supply chain project and related regional distribution centers and sysco’s ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable 

these statements are based on management’s current expectations and estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed above in addition sysco’s ability to increase its market share and sales meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses the ability to meet longterm debt to capitalization target ratios also may be affected by cash flow including amounts spent on share repurchases and acquisitions and internal growth 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes sysco’s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk floating rate debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes the company to shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 

sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 

at july 2 2005 the company had outstanding 157851000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through july 29 2005 the company’s total longterm debt obligations of 1367110000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest the company intends to issue between 350000000 and 500000000 of longterm debt in september 2005 the amount of longterm debt that sysco issues will depend upon market conditions at the time of issuance in march 2005 sysco entered into a forwardstarting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 350000000 as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on 350000000 of the forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 

during fiscal 2004 and part of fiscal 2005 sysco had several fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding these were entered into in fiscal 2004 as management believed that floating interest rates were more advantageous during fiscal 2005 sysco terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swaps outstanding locking in effective yields on the related debt 

management believes that present market conditions reflect fixed long term rates near historical lows as such management believes that fixed long term rates present a better opportunity than in the recent past and intends to issue long term debt at fixed rates with extended terms in september 2005 

in the following tables commercial paper issuances are reflected as floating rate debt and the us commercial paper is classified as longterm based on the maturity of the company’s revolving loan agreement which supports the company’s us commercial paper program and the company’s intent to continue to refinance this facility on a longterm basis 

the following tables present the company’s interest rate position as of july 2 2005 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

 

 

 at july 3 2004 the company had outstanding 73834000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through october 7 2004 the company’s total longterm debt obligations of 1394326000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest in addition the company entered into interest rate swap agreements totaling 500000000 in notional amount whereby the company received interest payments at fixed rates of interest and paid interest at variable rates the following tables present the company’s interest rate position as of july 3 2004 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents 

 

 

 

 the company does not believe that its foreign operations expose it to significant foreign exchange risk since the exposure is limited primarily to canada and for which the amounts are not material on an overall basis to sysco 

increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations in three areas first the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home second the high cost of fuel can increase the price paid by sysco for product purchases for which sysco may not be able to pass these costs fully to its customers third increased fuel costs impact the costs incurred by sysco to deliver product to its customers during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 fuel costs represented approximately 04 03 and 03 of sales respectively fuel costs incurred by sysco in fiscal 2005 increased by approximately 31000000 over fiscal 2004 

in order to partially manage the volatility and uncertainty of fuel costs sysco from time to time will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of sysco’s projected monthly diesel fuel requirements forward diesel fuel purchase commitments outstanding as of july 2 2005 were not material

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
         of operations

highlights

     sales increased 122 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 fiscal 2004 included
53 weeks which represented an additional week over the 52 weeks in fiscal 2003
this additional week represented an estimated 22 of the sales increase in
fiscal 2004 gross margins as a percent of sales for fiscal 2004 decreased from
the prior year due to the impact of product cost increases and changes in
customer mix segment mix and product mix operating expenses as a percent of
sales for fiscal 2004 decreased from the prior year due to operating
efficiencies and operating costs increasing at lower rates than the sales price
increases driven by product cost increases operating expenses were negatively
impacted by increased net pension costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the national supply chain project and were favorably impacted by gains recorded
related to the cash surrender value of life insurance assets primarily as a
result of these factors net earnings increased 166 in fiscal 2004 over fiscal
2003 the earnings increases in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 also include the
impact of the additional week in fiscal 2004

     the impact on our customers of a prolonged period of rising product costs
internally estimated at 63 for the fiscal year and 80 for the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2004 has contributed to a softer foodservice market management
believes that the softness in the foodservice market together with general
economic conditions contributed to a slowing of sales growth for the company in
the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which is continuing in the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 the company has renewed its focus on expense
controls in fiscal 2005 including managing labor costs and productivity and
ongoing benchmarking and sharing of best practices at the operating companies

overview

     sysco distributes food and related products to the foodservice industry
including restaurants healthcare and educational facilities lodging
establishments and other foodservice customers syscos operations are located
throughout the united states and canada and include broadline companies
specialty produce companies customcut meat operations asian cuisine
foodservice hotel supply operations sygma the companys chain restaurant
distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to internationally
located chain restaurants

     the company estimates that it serves more than 14 of an approximately 207
billion annual foodservice market that includes the north american foodservice
nonfood and hotel amenity furniture and textile markets the foodservice or
foodpreparedawayfromhome market represents approximately onehalf of the
total food purchases made at the consumer level this share has grown from about
37 in 1972 since food purchases in the foodservice industry have grown more
rapidly than food purchases in the retail grocery industry over most of that
time period factors influencing this trend and therefore syscos growth
include increases in dualworker and singleparent families busier lifestyles
the general aging of the population growing affluence and the increasing
demand for the variety convenience and entertainment afforded by the
proliferation of restaurants and other foodservice operations industry
statisticians and demographers expect most of these general trends to continue
although they may not continue at the same pace

     general economic conditions and consumer confidence can have an effect on
the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home and
therefore on sysco however we have consistently grown at a faster rate than
the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented
industry

     the company intends to continue to expand its market share and grow
earnings through strategies which include

      profitable sales growth in addition to expansion through foldouts new
       operating companies created in established markets previously served by
       other sysco operating companies and a disciplined acquisition program
       refining the use of customer purchasing potential and profitability data
       in targeting new customers deepening relationships with existing
       customers tailoring products and

                                        11

       services and allocating associated resources by customer and managing
       the profitability of or exiting low profit or unprofitable customers

      brand management leveraging brand strength to grow sales and
       profitability while ensuring strict quality control processes and
       providing greater value to customers

      productivity deploying the latest technology and leveraging best
       business practices to improve operating efficiencies and leverage
       expenses to sales growth

      sales force effectiveness targeted recruiting training and compensation
       of marketing associates expanding the business development and business
       review functions to further strengthen our marketing associatecustomer
       relationships

      supply chain optimization creating a more efficient and effective supply
       chain infrastructure through the national supply chain project

     the companys national supply chain project is intended to optimize the
supply chain activities for certain products from syscos operating companies in
each respective region and as a result reduce inventory and operating costs
working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at syscos
operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and
customers the company expects to build from five to ten regional distribution
centers over a period of ten years the first regional distribution center in
the northeast is expected to be operational during the third quarter of fiscal
2005

sales

     sales increased 122 in fiscal 2004 and 119 in fiscal 2003 over the
prior years the additional week contributed approximately 22 to the overall
sales growth rate for fiscal 2004 because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2003 sales growth for fiscal
2004 is not directly comparable to the prior year in order to provide a more
comparable picture of sales growth during fiscal 2004 management believes that
it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by the estimated
impact of the additional week as a result sales for fiscal 2004 presented in
the table below are adjusted by onefourteenth of total sales for the fourth
quarter failure to make these adjustments might cause investors to

acquisitions contributed 09 to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2004
and 52 for fiscal 2003 estimated product cost increases an internal measure
of inflation were 63 during fiscal 2004 as compared to a flat rate during
fiscal 2003 sysco generally expects to pass product cost increases to its
customers however the actual amount of inflation reflected as sales price
increases is difficult to quantify management believes that syscos restaurant
operator customers have experienced softness in their rate of sales growth as
cost and price increases impact customer spending product cost increases in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reached 80 management believes that the
softness in the foodservice market together with general economic conditions
contributed to a slowing of syscos sales growth in the latter half of the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 which is continuing in the first quarter of fiscal
2005

     industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced a real
sales decline of approximately 07 in calendar year 2003 and real sales growth
of 05 in calendar year 2002

cost of sales

     cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 807 in fiscal 2004 803 in
fiscal 2003 and 802 in fiscal 2002 management believes that cost of sales as
a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 was impacted by several factors including
product cost increases and changes in customer mix segment mix and product mix
however the specific impact of each factor is difficult to quantify product
cost increases in substantially all product categories also had the impact of
reducing gross margins as a percentage of sales as gross profit dollars are
earned on a higher sales dollar base dairy and meat products which are
especially affected by product cost increases since they are often sold on a
costperpound plus a fee basis rather than a percentage markup experienced the
highest rates of inflation the result was a higher sales price but a lower
gross margin as a percentage of sales even as gross margin dollars were
maintained or even increased multiunit customer sales in the broadline
segment which traditionally yield lower gross margins and lower expenses than
marketing associateserved customer sales grew faster than sales to marketing
associateserved customer sales sales at the sygma and the other segments
which traditionally have lower margins than the broadline segment grew faster
than sales at the broadline segment in the area of product mix meat sales
continued to grow as a percentage of overall sales and also experienced a high
rate of cost increases meat products typically generate higher prices and
higher gross margin dollars per case than the average of other products but
lower gross margins as a percentage of sales therefore increased sales of
these products had the effect of decreasing overall gross margins as a
percentage of sales even as gross margin dollars were maintained or increased

     the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2003 was
primarily a result of two factors first multiunit sales growth was greater
than marketing associateserved sales growth second freshcut meat sales grew
as a percentage of overall sales

     in fiscal 2002 cost of sales was influenced by syscos overall customer
and product mix economies realized in purchasing and increased sales of sysco
brand products

operating expenses

     operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products
as well as selling administrative and occupancy expenses these expenses as a
percent of sales were 141 for fiscal 2004 147 for fiscal 2003 and 149 for
fiscal 2002 changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to
sales result from an interplay of several factors including improved
efficiencies customer mix and product cost increases

     the decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable to several factors including improved
operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense
metrics tracked at the broadline operating companies including pieces sold per
delivery product line items sold per delivery pieces per trip and pieces per
error increases in product costs and the resulting increased average sales
price per item also favorably impacted expenses as a percentage of sales as
operating costs increased at a lower rate operating expenses were negatively
impacted by increases in net pension costs of 39944000 and by increases in
expenses related to the national supply chain project of 5584000 over fiscal
2003 management estimates that the company will incur an additional 40000000
to 50000000 in expenses related to the national supply chain project in
fiscal 2005 over what was incurred in fiscal 2004 including depreciation of the
first redistribution center

     operating expenses were also favorably impacted by the recognition of
income in fiscal 2004 of 19124000 to adjust the carrying value of life
insurance assets to their cash surrender value the gains in fiscal 2004 were
recognized in the first 39 weeks with a modest loss of 97000 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 this contrasted with fiscal 2003 where a gain of
13000000 was recognized in the fourth quarter reversing the majority of prior
losses recognized in the first 39 weeks and resulting in a net loss of 156000
for the fiscal year

     the company has renewed its focus on expense controls in fiscal 2005
including managing labor costs and productivity and ongoing benchmarking and
sharing of best practices at the operating companies

     the decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily attributable to improved operating
efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics
including pieces sold per delivery and product line items sold per delivery
these operating expense improvements were partially offset by increases in net
pension costs of 22952000 and by increases in expenses incurred in connection
with the national supply chain project of 5996000 over fiscal 2002

     operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by increases in
marketing associateserved sales for which higher expenses are incurred to
serve these customers

interest expense

     interest expense decreased 33 in fiscal 2004 and increased 148 in
fiscal 2003 over the prior years the decrease in interest expense in fiscal
2004 was primarily due to lower borrowing rates offsetting moderately higher
borrowing levels the lower average borrowing rates of the company in fiscal
2004 were due to lower shortterm market interest rates and the use of interest
rate swaps which converted the fixed rates of interest on a portion of syscos
long term debt to lower variable rates of interest the increase in interest
expense in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased borrowings partially
offset by decreases in interest rate levels

other net

     other net was income of 12365000 in fiscal 2004 8347000 in fiscal
2003 and 2805000 in fiscal 2002 changes between the years result from
fluctuations in miscellaneous activities primarily gains and losses on the sale
of surplus facilities

earnings before income taxes

     earnings before income taxes increased 170 in fiscal 2004 and 145 in
fiscal 2003 over the prior years the increases were due to the factors
discussed above the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in
fiscal 2004

provision for income taxes

     the effective tax rate was 3850 in fiscal 2004 and 3825 in fiscal 2003
and 2002

net earnings

     fiscal 2004 represents the twentyeighth consecutive year of increased
earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes net earnings
increased 166 in fiscal 2004 and 145 in fiscal 2003 over the prior periods
the increases were due to the factors discussed above

return on average shareholders equity

     the return on average shareholders equity was approximately 39 in fiscal
2004 36 in fiscal 2003 and 31 in fiscal 2002 the increase in net earnings
and share repurchases in fiscal 2004 reduced by the reversal of a portion of
minimum pension liability contributed to the increase in fiscal 2004 since its
inception sysco has averaged approximately 19 return on average shareholders
equity

broadline segment

     broadline segment sales increased 104 in fiscal 2004 and 121 in fiscal
2003 over the prior years acquisitions contributed 02 to the overall sales
growth rate for fiscal 2004 and 56 in fiscal 2003 the fiscal 2004 sales
growth was due to increased sales to marketing associateserved customers and
multiunit customers including increased sales of sysco brand products and
price increases resulting from higher product costs the additional week also
contributed to the sales growth in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2003 sales growth was
due primarily to increased sales to marketing associateserved and multiunit
customers including increased sales of sysco brand products as well as the
acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice operation the sales growth in
both years was obtained through increased sales to the existing customer base as
well as the acquisition of new customers broadline segment sales as a
percentage of total sysco sales were 809 in fiscal 2004 822 in fiscal 2003
and 821 in fiscal 2002 the decrease in fiscal 2004 was due primarily to
strong sales growth in the customcut meat sygma and lodging industry product
segments outpacing the broadline sales growth as well as the acquisition of the
asian cuisine foodservice operations during fiscal 2003 the increase in fiscal
2003 was due primarily to the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice
operation

     marketing associateserved sales as a percentage of broadline sales in the
us decreased to 543 in fiscal 2004 as compared to 546 in fiscal 2003 the
decrease in fiscal 2004 was due to the rate of sales increase to multiunit
customers exceeding the rate of sales increase to marketing associateserved
customers the growth in sales to multiunit customers was fueled by increased
sales to existing locations and the addition of new locations sysco brand sales
as a percentage of broadline sales in the us increased to 491 for fiscal
2004 as compared to 487 in fiscal 2003

     earnings before income taxes for the broadline segment increased 144 in
fiscal 2004 and 128 in fiscal 2003 over the prior years the increase in
earnings before income taxes for fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increased
sales and reduced expenses as a percentage of sales which more than offset
reduced margins as a

                                        17

percentage of sales reduced expenses as a percentage of sales is attributable
to several factors including improved operating efficiencies the decrease in
margins and expenses as a percentage of sales was also impacted by increases in
product costs and the resulting increase in the average sales price per item
the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in fiscal 2004 the
increases in earnings before income taxes for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 were
primarily due to increases in sales and lower expenses as a percentage of sales

sygma segment

     sygma segment sales increased 217 in fiscal 2004 and 92 in fiscal 2003
over the prior years acquisitions contributed 19 to the overall sales growth
rate for fiscal 2004 and 28 in fiscal 2003 the fiscal 2004 sales growth was
due primarily to sales to new customers sales growth in sygmas existing
customer base related to new locations added by those customers as well as
increases in sales to existing locations price increases resulting from higher
product costs and sales from acquisitions the additional week also contributed
to the sales growth in fiscal 2004 the fiscal 2003 sales growth was primarily
due to sales growth in sygmas existing customer base as well as the acquisition
of two quickservice operations sygma segment sales as a percentage of total
sysco sales were 121 in fiscal 2004 112 in fiscal 2003 and 114 in fiscal
2002

     earnings before income taxes for the sygma segment increased 72 in fiscal
2004 and 34 in fiscal 2003 over the prior years the increase in fiscal 2004
was primarily due to the increased sales offset by increased expenses incurred
related to implementation of new systems severance payments related to certain
personnel changes costs related to workers compensation insurance claims and
pension costs the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth in
fiscal 2004 the increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased sales

     during fiscal 2004 and continuing in the first quarter of fiscal 2005
sygma is discontinuing servicing a portion of its largest customers locations
due to that customers geographic supply chain realignment sygma expects to
offset these lost sales by obtaining sales from additional locations from this
customer and obtaining new business from other customers in many cases this
new business will be served out of different sygma locations than those that
served the business that was discontinued as a result during fiscal 2004
sygma incurred additional expenses including severance payments and equipment
moving costs as it transitioned its operations to serve these new customers
sygma expects to incur similar expenses during the first and second quarter of
fiscal 2005 as it continues to transition to serve these new customers any net
lost sales and the related additional expenses are not expected to be material
to sysco overall and we expect sygma to continue to be a profitable segment

other segments

     other segment sales increased 190 in fiscal 2004 and 173 in fiscal 2003
over the prior years acquisitions contributed 62 to the overall sales growth
rate for fiscal 2004 and 49 in fiscal 2003 the increase in fiscal 2004 was
primarily attributable to increased sales to the existing customer base sales
to new customers price increases resulting from higher product costs and sales
from acquisitions the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in
fiscal 2004 the increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to sales
growth in our custom meatcutting operations as well as the timing of
acquisitions made during the year other segment sales as a percentage of total
sysco sales were 81 in fiscal 2004 77 in fiscal 2003 and 73 in fiscal
2002

     earnings before income taxes for the other segment increased 554 in
fiscal 2004 and 48 in fiscal 2003 over the prior years the increase in fiscal
2004 was primarily due to increases in sales acquisitions and reduced expenses
as a percentage of sales which more than offset reduced gross margins as a
percentage of sales the additional week also contributed to the earnings growth
in fiscal 2004 the increase in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to acquisitions
increased earnings from increased gross margins and operating efficiencies at
our specialty produce operations and increased earnings from increased sales
and gross margins at the companys specialty lodging industry products
operations these were offset by expenses incurred on a startup operation
supplying the health care industry and decreased earnings at the companys
specialty meatcutting operations

liquidity and capital resources

     sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers
primarily throughout the united states and canada the company intends to
continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth foldouts
and acquisitions the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its
marketing associates its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of
its warehousing and distribution activities these objectives require continuing
investment syscos resources include cash provided by operations and access to
capital from financial markets

     syscos operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash
generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements
investments in facilities fleet and other equipment required to meet customers
needs cash dividends and acquisitions compatible with the companys overall
growth strategy any remaining cash generated from operations may at the
discretion of management be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share
repurchase program while the remainder of the cost may be financed with
additional longterm debt syscos share repurchase program is used primarily to
offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans for
acquisitions to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of
increasing earnings per share and to aid in managing the ratio of longterm
debt to total capitalization management targets a longterm debt to total
capitalization ratio between 35 and 40 the ratio may exceed the target range
from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and
internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount
of share repurchases the ratio also may fall below the target range due to
strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of
share repurchases this ratio was 324 and 362 at july 3 2004 and june 28
2003 respectively the reversal of a portion of the minimum pension liability
adjustments in other comprehensive income contributed to the decrease in the
ratio at july 3 2004

     the company generated net cash from operations of 1189522000 in fiscal
2004 1372840000 in fiscal 2003 and 1084980000 in fiscal 2002 several
factors contributed to the decrease in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2004
during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the company began reorganizing its
supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the
effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the
benefit of customers the structure results in the deferral of certain federal
and state income tax payments as supply chain distributions are not included in
taxable income until distributed in periods subsequent to when they are
recognized in book income fiscal 2004 is the first period that supply chain
distributions were included in taxable income since the company began deferring
these items for tax purposes in fiscal 2002 as a result of the impact of these
items and other temporary differences including the utilization of us federal
net operating loss carryforwards excess tax depreciation and pension
contributions taxes paid during fiscal 2004 increased to 344414000 as
compared to 28747000 in fiscal 2003 the company expects the net cash flow
impact of deferrals in fiscal 2005 and beyond to be incrementally positive when
compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral
due to the companys belief that its volume through the new structure will
continue to grow

     cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by
increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances partially offset by
increases in accounts payable balances and increases in accrued expenses and
other liabilities increased sales volumes over the prior periods partially
contributed to the increase in accounts receivable balances sysco has also
experienced sales increases with multiunit customers that have outpaced the
sales increases from marketing associateserved customers multiunit customers
payment terms are traditionally longer than the sysco average inventory levels
also increased over prior year levels partially due to the increased sales
volumes in addition inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2004 measured as a
function of average days sales outstanding exceeded the levels at the end of
fiscal 2003 which in turn were lower than those at the end of fiscal 2002 this
relative increase in inventory levels negatively impacted cash flow from
operations for fiscal 2004 the increase in accounts payable balances was
partially due to the increased inventory balances but was also negatively
impacted by decreases in accounts payable days outstanding over the prior
periods a significant reason for the decrease in accrued expenses and other
longterm liabilities in fiscal 2003 was the increase in pension contributions
from 83136000 in fiscal 2002 to 164565000 in fiscal 2003 pension
contributions in fiscal 2004 were 165512000 the company anticipates pension
contributions in fiscal 2005 will be approximately 86294000

     as part of normal business activities sysco issues letters of credit
through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance
agreements as of july 3 2004 and june 28 2003 letters of credit outstanding
were 11001000 and 14610000 respectively

     in summary sysco believes that through continual monitoring and management
of assets together with the availability of additional capital in the financial
markets it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity
for normal operating purposes

     the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred
compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions including retirement
ages and payout periods for purposes of this table purchase obligations
include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business
for which all significant terms have been confirmed such amounts included in
the table above are based on estimates

     certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration typically payable
only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain
outstanding contingencies are resolved aggregate contingent

consideration amounts outstanding as of july 3 2004 included approximately
1273000 shares of syscos common stock and 61614000 in cash these amounts
are not included in the table above

critical accounting policies

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and
expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting
policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial
statements

     critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the
portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations these
policies require managements most subjective or complex judgments often
employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board
of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates
and this related disclosure syscos most critical accounting policies pertain
to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs
pension plans and accounting for business combinations

allowance for doubtful accounts

     sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines
the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability
to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be
collected in addition allowances are recorded for all other receivables based
on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries the company
utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written
off including bankruptcy accounts referred to outside parties for collection
and accounts past due over specified periods if the financial condition of
syscos customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required

selfinsurance program

     sysco maintains a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers
compensation group medical general liability and vehicle liability costs the
amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured by third party
insurers liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by
considering historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors
and other actuarial assumptions projections of future loss expenses are
inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims
occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims
differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate
the risks of workers compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety
procedures and awareness programs have been implemented

pension plans

     sysco maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans
for its employees the company also contributes to various multiemployer plans
under collective bargaining agreements sysco maintains a qualified retirement
plan retirement plan for its employees which pays benefits to employees at
retirement using formulas based on a participants years of service and
compensation sysco also maintains a nonqualified unfunded supplemental
executive retirement plan serp which provides additional retirement benefits
to certain key employees in order to meet its obligations under the serp the
company maintains life insurance policies on the lives of participants sysco is
the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies which are excluded from plan
assets in arriving at prepaid accrued benefit cost cash surrender values of
such policies were 87104000 at july 3 2004 and 74730000 at june 28 2003

     sysco accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 employers
accounting for pensions as amended by sfas no 132 employers disclosures
about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment

                                        22

of fasb statements no 87 88 and 106 these statements require that the
amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial
basis three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are
the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the
assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the
expected rate of return on plan assets

     for guidance in determining the discount rate sysco refers to rates of
return on highquality fixedincome investments including among other items
moodys longterm aa corporate bond yields the discount rate utilized by sysco
was 625 and 600 as of july 3 2004 and june 28 2003 respectively the
discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate
as it was at july 3 2004 when the discount rate was increased to 625 from
600 and at june 28 2003 when the discount rate was reduced to 600 from
725

     the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of net
pension costs the 125 decrease in the discount rate used at june 28 2003
increased syscos net pension costs for fiscal 2004 by approximately
37000000 the increase in the discount rate of 025 at july 3 2004 will
decrease syscos net pension costs for fiscal 2005 by approximately 9500000

     sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase
in compensation levels sysco used a plan specific agerelated set of rates
equivalent to a single rate of 589 for the retirement plan as of july 3
2004 and june 28 2003 the serp assumes annual salary increases of 10 through
fiscal 2007 and 7 thereafter as of july 3 2004 and annual salary increases of
8 through fiscal 2005 and 7 thereafter as of june 28 2003

     the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan
was 900 and 950 as of july 3 2004 and june 28 2003 respectively the
expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that
incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a
combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking
views of the financial markets regarding the yield on longterm bonds and the
historical returns of the major stock markets although not determinative of
future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed
using geometriccompound averaging was approximately 106 85 36 and
219 over the 20year 10year 5year and 1year periods ended december 31
2003 respectively in addition in nine of the last fifteen years the actual
return on plan assets has exceeded 900 the rate of return assumption is
reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate as it was for fiscal 2004
when the expected return was reduced to 900 from 950

     the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net
pension costs the 050 decrease in the assumed rate of return in fiscal 2004
increased syscos net pension costs for fiscal 2004 by approximately 3400000
a 10 increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2005 would
decrease increase syscos net pension costs for fiscal 2005 by approximately
9200000

     minimum pension liability adjustments are recorded so that the recorded
pension liability is at least equal to the accumulated benefit obligation
minimum pension liability adjustments are noncash adjustments that are
reflected as an increase or decrease in the pension liability and an
offsetting charge to shareholders equity net of tax through comprehensive
income or loss

     during fiscal 2004 a minimum pension liability adjustment of 266075000
was recorded as a debit to the companys net pension balance as of july 3 2004
of this adjustment 267535000 was recorded to reverse all minimum pension
liability adjustments recorded in prior years related to the retirement plan at
july 3 2004 the fair value of plan assets of the retirement plan exceeded the
accumulated benefit obligation eliminating the need for a minimum pension
liability adjustment the change in the companys funded position related to the
retirement plan was due primarily to the better than expected return on plan
assets in fiscal 2004 of approximately 111127000 as compared to an expected
return of approximately 61148000 voluntary contribution to the qualified
pension trust in fiscal 2004 of 160000000 and the increase in the discount
rate at july 3 2004 to 625 at july 3 2004 the accumulated benefit
obligation of the serp continued to exceed the fair value of plan assets and
required an additional minimum pension liability adjustment of 1460000 during
fiscal 2004 to increase the accrued pension cost related to the serp

                                        23
page

     during fiscal 2003 a minimum pension liability adjustment of 193819000
was recorded as a credit to the companys net pension balance as of june 28
2003 this adjustment was due to the companys accumulated benefit obligations
exceeding the fair value of plan assets for both the retirement plan and the
serp and was due to lower than expected returns on plan assets and the decrease
in the discount rate at june 28 2003 to 600

     amounts reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related
to minimum pension liability net of tax were 20733000 as of july 3 2004
and 185118000 as of june 28 2003

     the companys prepaid pension cost prior to the recognition of the
additional minimum pension liability was 142620000 and 91340000 at july 3
2004 and june 28 2003 respectively included in arriving at accrued benefit
cost as of july 3 2004 and june 28 2003 respectively are 454468000 and
493829000 in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of
actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions a portion of
this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with sfas no
87 in net pension costs over time

     the company recognized net pension costs of 114232000 net of an
expected asset return of 61148000 74288000 net of an expected asset
return of 46462000 and 51336000 net of an expected asset return of
43053000 for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively changes in the
assumptions together with the normal growth of the plan and the impact of
actuarial losses from prior periods increased net pension costs 39944000 in
fiscal 2004 and is expected to decrease net pension costs in fiscal 2005 by
approximately 7374000

     the company made cash contributions to its pension plans of 165512000
and 164565000 in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively including
voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of 160000000 in each of fiscal
2004 and fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2005 as in the previous years contributions to
the retirement plan will not be required to meet erisa minimum funding
requirements but the company anticipates that it will make voluntary
contributions of approximately 80000000 the estimated fiscal 2005
contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other postretirement
plans are 6294000 and 362000 respectively

accounting for business combinations

     goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over
the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and
estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired
including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the
allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit in addition sysco
assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair
values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values the
evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections estimates and
assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a
discounted cash flow analysis as well as assumptions regarding sales and
earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the
industry actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections
resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing
an impairment loss

new accounting standards

     sysco adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no
0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables effective at the
beginning of fiscal 2004 eitf 0021 addresses how to account for revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables and provides guidance relating to when
such arrangements should be divided into components for revenue recognition
purposes the adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on
syscos consolidated financial statements

     sysco adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation
of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin
arb no 51 effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004 this interpretation
introduces a new consolidation model the variable interests model which
determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains
and losses of the entity being

                                        24
page

evaluated for consolidation the adoption of this interpretation did not have a
material impact on syscos consolidated financial statements

     sysco adopted the provisions of sfas no 150 accounting for certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity
effective at the beginning of fiscal 2004 sfas no 150 establishes standards
for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity the adoption of this statement
did not have a material effect on syscos consolidated financial statements

     sysco adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 132 revised 2003
employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits in
the third quarter of fiscal 2004 the standard requires that companies provide
additional financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans in annual
and interim financial statements which are found under the discussion of
employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements

     in march 2004 the fasb issued an exposure draft sharebased payment an
amendment of statements no 123 and 95 the proposed change in accounting would
replace existing requirements under sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased
compensation and apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to
employees under the proposal all forms of sharebased payments to employees
including employee stock options would be expensed recognizing the cost in the
income statement the expense of each award would generally be measured at fair
value at the grant date as proposed sysco would have to adopt the new
statement beginning in fiscal 2006 the adoption of this proposed standard is
expected to have a material impact on syscos consolidated financial statements
as the company currently accounts for its stock compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method provided by apb no 25 and thus has not recorded any
compensation expense with respect to stock option grants to date

risk factors

low margin business inflation and economic sensitivity

     the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high
inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins sysco makes a significant
portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells
plus a percentage markup as a result syscos profit levels may be negatively
impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though syscos gross
profit percentage may remain relatively constant prolonged periods of product
cost inflation may also have a negative impact on the companys profit margins
and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to
customers due to resistance to higher prices the foodservice industry is
sensitive to national and regional economic conditions inflation fuel costs
and other factors affecting consumer confidence and the frequency and amount
spent by consumers for food prepared away from home may negatively impact
syscos sales and operating results syscos operating results are also
sensitive to and may be adversely affected by other factors including
difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable competitive price
pressures severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other
transportationrelated costs although these factors have not had a material
adverse impact on syscos past operations there can be no assurance that one or
more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results

leverage and debt service

     because historically a substantial part of syscos growth has been the
result of acquisitions and capital expansion syscos continued growth depends
in large part on its ability to continue this expansion as a result its
inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed
funds could restrict its ability to expand moreover any default under the
documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse
effect on the market value of syscos common stock further syscos leveraged
position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures

                                        25
page

product liability claims

     sysco like any other seller of food faces the risk of exposure to product
liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company
causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims sysco
believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance
however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost
or if available may not be adequate to cover all of syscos liabilities sysco
generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties
supplying its products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is
limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying
party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco
does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available
product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce syscos
net earnings and earnings per share

interruption of supplies

     sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice and related products
from third party suppliers for the most part sysco does not have longterm
contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco
although syscos purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with
suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies
needed by sysco in the quantities requested because sysco does not control the
actual production of the products it sells it is also subject to delays caused
by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control these
conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers weather
crop conditions transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other
catastrophic events syscos inability to obtain adequate supplies of its
foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or
otherwise could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers
and customers may turn to other distributors

labor relations

     as of july 3 2004 approximately 9100 employees at 51 operating companies
were members of 59 different local unions associated with the international
brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal 2005 12
agreements covering approximately 1900 employees will expire failure of the
operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in
work stoppages although syscos operating subsidiaries have not experienced any
significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and sysco believes they
have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage due to
failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract
or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on sysco

integration of acquired companies

     if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and
realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner
its profitability may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more
difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or
no expertise or with a corporate culture different from syscos if sysco is
unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully it may incur substantial
costs and delays in increasing its customer base in addition the failure to
integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from
syscos existing business and may damage syscos relationships with its key
customers and suppliers

charter and stockholder rights plan

     under its restated certificate of incorporation syscos board of directors
is authorized to issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock without
stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for
anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on
the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts
to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the
stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco
pursuant to its stockholder rights plan which could result in substantial
dilution to a potential

                                        26
page

acquiror the existence of either of these provisions could deter hostile
takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco that could
otherwise have been financially beneficial to syscos stockholders

forwardlooking statements

     certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express
managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future
events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 they include statements about syscos ability to increase
its market share and sales longterm debt to capitalization target ratios
anticipated capital expenditures timing and expected benefits of the national
supply chain initiative and related regional distribution centers and syscos
ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable

     these statements are based on managements current expectations and
estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors
discussed above in addition syscos ability to increase its market share and
sales meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by
conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the
ability to control expenses the ability to meet longterm debt to
capitalization target ratios may also be affected by share repurchases cash
flow acquisitions and internal growth



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes syscos
use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk floating rate
debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes the company to
shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest
rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes the company to changes in
market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk
that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher
rate

     sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of
fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve
that goal the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the
interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases
in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the
creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions

     at july 3 2004 the company had outstanding 73834000 of commercial
paper at variable rates of interest with maturities through october 7 2004 the
companys total longterm debt obligations of 1394326000 were primarily at
fixed rates of interest in addition the company has entered into interest rate
swap agreements totaling 500000000 in notional amount whereby the company
receives interest payments at fixed rates of interest and pays interest at
variable rates the following tables present the companys interest rate
position as of july 3 2004 all amounts are stated in us dollar equivalents

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
         of operations

liquidity and capital resources

     sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers
throughout the united states and canada the company intends to continue to
expand its market share through profitable sales growth foldouts and
acquisitions the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its
marketing associates its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of
its warehousing and distribution activities these objectives require continuing
investment syscos resources include cash provided by operations and access to
capital from financial markets

     syscos operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash
generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements
investments in facilities fleet and other equipment required to meet customers
needs cash dividends and acquisitions compatible with the companys overall
growth strategy any remaining cash generated from operations may at the
discretion of management be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share
repurchase program while the remainder of the cost may be financed with
additional longterm debt syscos share repurchase program is used primarily to
offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans for
acquisitions and to reduce shares outstanding which may have the net effect of
increasing earnings per share management targets a longterm debt to total
capitalization ratio between 35 and 40 the ratio may exceed the target range
from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and
internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount
of share repurchases the ratio also may fall below the target range due to
strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of
share repurchases this ratio was 362 and 356 at june 28 2003 and june 29
2002 respectively

     the company generated net cash from operations of 1372840000 in fiscal
2003 1084980000 in fiscal 2002 and 955224000 in fiscal 2001 the
overall increases in operating results contributed to the annual increases in
cash flows from operations in addition several factors also contributed to the
increase in cash flow from operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2002
the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated
efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement
functions performed for the benefit of customers the new structure results in
the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments and is reflected
in the increase in net deferred taxes tax payments made during the year of
28747000 were 211045000 less than tax payments made in the prior year
this decrease is primarily due to the deferrals discussed above as well as the
impact of other temporary differences and the timing and amount of tax payments
the company estimates the cash flow savings from this deferral in fiscal 2003 to
be approximately 410000000 as compared to approximately 267000000 in
fiscal 2002 the company expects the positive cash flow impact of deferrals in
fiscal 2004 and beyond to be less than fiscal 2003 levels as it will begin
making payments related to these deferrals in fiscal 2004 the company expects
the net cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal 2004 and beyond to be
incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual
basis without the deferral due to the companys belief that its volume through
the new structure will continue to grow in addition a federal tax payment of
75000000 normally due in the fourth quarter of 2001 was deferred until the
first quarter of 2002 as allowed by the internal revenue service due to the
texas tropical storm allison disaster and is reflected in the decrease of
accrued income taxes in fiscal 2002

     cash flow from operations for fiscal 2003 was positively impacted by
increases in accounts payable balances offset by increases in accounts
receivable and inventory balances and decreases in accrued expenses and other
liabilities increased sales volumes over the comparable periods contributed to
the increase in accounts receivable balances sysco has also experienced sales
increases with national contract customers that have outpaced the sales
increases from marketing associateserved customers national contract
customers payment terms are traditionally longer than the sysco average in
addition sysco had approximately 37000000 in receivables past due at
yearend from a us military contractor that have since been paid the
increased sales volumes also contributed to the increase in inventory balances
the increase in accounts payable balances was partially due to the increased
inventory balances and was significantly aided by an increase in accounts
payable days outstanding over the comparable period a contributor to the
decrease in

                                        11

416393000 in fiscal 2002 and 341138000 in fiscal 2001 the increase in
fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the construction of foldout
facilities in las vegas nevada and ventura california replacement facilities
in cleveland ohio dallas texas and miami florida and the northeast
redistribution center in front royal virginia first phase of the national
supply chain initiative the increase in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 was
primarily due to the construction of foldout facilities located in sacramento
california columbia south carolina and las vegas nevada fiscal 2002

facilities in dallas texas norman oklahoma baraboo wisconsin and jersey
city new jersey total expenditures in fiscal 2004 are expected to increase to

technology expenditures for acquisitions of businesses were 209010000 in
fiscal 2003 234618000 in fiscal 2002 and 10363000 in fiscal 2001

     the national supply chain project is expected to create a more efficient
and effective supply chain infrastructure for sysco its suppliers and its
customers the project entails the implementation of regional distribution
centers which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain
activities for certain products from all sysco operating companies in the
region the project is expected to achieve lower costs of inventory

lowering working capital and future facility expansion needs at the operating
companies the northeast redistribution center is expected to be operational in
the summer of 2004 the center will receive and distribute food and foodrelated
products to sysco operating companies in the northeast creating benefits for
customers and suppliers as well as for sysco

cost of sales

     cost of sales increased approximately 121 in fiscal 2003 69 in fiscal
2002 and 119 in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2003 the increase in cost of sales
resulted in gross margins as a percent of sales decreasing 008 percentage
points compared to the prior year this decrease was primarily attributable to
two factors first multiunit sales growth of 133 was greater than marketing
associateserved sales growth of 105 multiunit sales tend to have lower
gross margins coupled with lower expenses than marketing associateserved
sales secondly freshcut meat sales grew as a percentage of overall sales as
these are higher price and lower gross margin percentage products this had the
effect of decreasing overall gross margins as a percent of sales even as gross
margin dollars increased in 2002 and 2001 the rate of increase in cost of
sales was less than the rate of sales increase leading to improved gross
margins the rate of increase in gross margins is influenced by syscos overall
customer and product mix economies realized in purchasing and higher sales of
sysco brand products

operating expenses

     operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products
as well as selling and administrative expenses these expenses as a percent of
sales were 147 for fiscal 2003 and 148 for fiscal 2002 and 2001 changes in
the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an
interplay of several factors including customer mix inflationary increases in
operating costs generally have been offset through improved productivity

                                        15
page

     the decrease in expenses in fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to
improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key
expense metrics including pieces sold per delivery and product line items sold
per delivery these operating expense improvements were partially offset by
increases in net pension costs of 22952000 and by increases in expenses
incurred in connection with the national supply chain initiative of 5996000

     operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by increased
costs realized during the initial operating periods of foldouts in sacramento
california columbia south carolina and las vegas nevada in addition the
increase in marketing associateserved sales is accompanied by higher expenses
to serve these customers

interest expense

     interest expense for fiscal 2003 increased 9337000 or approximately
148 over fiscal 2002 which had decreased 8879000 or approximately 124
below fiscal 2001 the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2003 was primarily
due to increased borrowings partially offset by decreases in interest rate
levels the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to
decreases in interest rates for shortterm and commercial paper borrowings
interest capitalized during construction periods for the past three years was
5244000 in fiscal 2003 3746000 in fiscal 2002 and 2995000 in fiscal
2001

other net

     other net was income of 8347000 in fiscal 2003 an increase of
5542000 from the income of 2805000 in fiscal 2002 fiscal 2002s income of
2805000 increased 2906000 from the 101000 expense in fiscal 2001
changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities
primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities

earnings before income taxes

     earnings before income taxes in fiscal 2003 rose 159517000 or
approximately 145 above fiscal 2002 which had increased 134215000 or
approximately 139 over fiscal 2001 additional sales and realization of
operating efficiencies contributed to the increases

provision for income taxes

     the effective tax rate was 3825 in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 sysco
anticipates an effective tax rate of 3850 in fiscal 2004 the increase is
attributable to the increasing effective rates of state income taxes

net earnings

     fiscal 2003 represents the twentyseventh consecutive year of increased net
earnings net earnings rose 98501000 or approximately 145 above fiscal
2002 which had increased 82878000 or approximately 139 over fiscal 2001
the increases were caused by additional sales operating efficiencies and other
factors discussed above

return on average shareholders equity

     the return on average shareholders equity was approximately 36 in fiscal
2003 and 31 in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 since its inception sysco has
averaged in excess of an 18 return on average shareholders equity before the
cumulative effect of accounting changes

broadline segment

     broadline segment sales increased by 121 in fiscal 2003 as compared to
fiscal 2002 and by 58 in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 the fiscal
2003 and 2002 sales growth was due primarily to increased sales to marketing
associateserved and multiunit customers including increased sales of sysco
brand products as well as the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice
operation the sales growth was obtained through

                                        16
page

increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new
customers broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales
increased to 822 in fiscal 2003 from 821 in fiscal 2002 which decreased from
831 in fiscal 2001 the increase in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to the
acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice operation the decrease in
fiscal 2002 was due primarily to acquisitions of specialty meat lodging
industry product and produce companies in the other segments and greater
percentage growth of specialty meat lodging industry companies and sygma
segment as a percentage of overall sysco sales

     earnings before income taxes for the broadline segment increased by 128
in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and by 124 in fiscal 2002 as
compared to fiscal 2001 the increases in earnings before income taxes for
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 were driven by improved operating efficiencies as
well as increased sales to multiunit and marketing associateserved customers
and increases in sales of sysco brand products

sygma segment

     sygma segment sales increased by 92 in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal
2002 and 106 in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 the fiscal 2003 sales
growth was primarily due to sales growth in sygmas existing customer base as
well as the acquisition of two quickservice operations sales growth in fiscal
2002 was due primarily to sales growth in sygmas existing customer base sygma
segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales decreased to 112 in fiscal
2003 from 114 in fiscal 2002 which increased from 111 in fiscal 2001 the
decrease in fiscal 2003 was due to the sales growth in the broadline and other
segments

     earnings before income taxes for the sygma segment increased by 34 in
fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and 412 in fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001 the increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased sales
the increase in fiscal 2002 was due to operating efficiencies and improved labor
productivity realized during the fiscal year

other segments

     other segment sales increased by 173 in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal
2002 and 239 in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 other segment sales as
a percentage of total sysco sales increased to 77 in fiscal 2003 from 73 in
fiscal 2002 which increased from 63 in fiscal 2001 the increase in fiscal
2003 was primarily attributable to sales growth in our custom meatcutting
operations as well as the timing of acquisitions made during the year the
increase in fiscal 2002 was due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made
during the year

     earnings before income taxes for the other segment increased by 48 in
fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and 155 in fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001 the increase in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to the acquisition of
a specialty distributor of products to the asian foodservice market increased
earnings from increased gross margins and operating efficiencies at the
companys specialty produce operations and increased earnings from increased
sales and gross margins at the companys specialty lodging industry products
operations these were offset by expenses incurred on a startup operation
supplying the health care industry and decreased earnings at the companys
specialty meatcutting operations this decrease was primarily attributable to
decreased gross margins as meat costs increased in a highly inflationary period
gross margin percentages on products priced on a markup per pound basis are
difficult to maintain during inflationary periods the increase in fiscal 2002
was due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods
presented but was offset by a decrease due to the downturn in demand in travel
and resort destination cities which are serviced by certain of the specialty
companies

critical accounting policies

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and
expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting
polices employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial
statements

                                        17
page

     critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the
portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations these
policies require managements most subjective or complex judgments often
employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board
of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates
and this related disclosure syscos most critical accounting policies pertain
to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs
pension plans and accounting for business combinations

allowance for doubtful accounts receivable

     sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines
the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customers inability
to meet its financial obligation a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be
collected in addition allowances are recorded for all other receivables based
on analysis of historical trends of writeoffs and recoveries the company
utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written
off including bankruptcy accounts referred to outside parties for collection
and accounts past due over specified periods if the financial condition of
syscos customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required

selfinsurance program

     sysco maintains a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers
compensation group medical general liability and vehicle liability costs the
amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured liabilities
associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical
claims experience demographic factors severity factors and other actuarial
assumptions projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain
because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be
significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these
assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate the risks of
workers compensation vehicle and general liability claims safety procedures
and awareness programs have been implemented

pension plans

     sysco maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans
for its employees the company also contributes to various multiemployer plans
under collective bargaining agreements the defined benefit pension plans pay
benefits to employees at retirement using formulas based on a participants
years of service and compensation sysco also maintains a nonqualified
unfunded supplementary executive retirement plan serp for key employees in
order to meet its obligations under the serp the company maintains life
insurance policies on the lives of participants sysco is the sole owner and
beneficiary of such policies which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at
prepaid accrued benefit cost cash surrender values of such policies were
74730000 at june 28 2003 and 71418000 at june 29 2002

     sysco accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 employers
accounting for pensions as amended by sfas no 132 employers disclosures
about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb
statements no 87 88 and 106 these statements require that the amounts
recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the
discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits the assumption
for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of
return on plan assets

     for guidance in determining the discount rate sysco refers to rates of
return on highquality fixedincome investments including among other items
moodys longterm aa corporate bond yields the discount rate utilized by sysco
was 600 and 725 as of june 28 2003 and june 29 2002 respectively the
discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate
as it was at june 28

                                        18
page

2003 when the discount rate was reduced to 600 from 725 and at june 29
2002 when the discount rate was reduced to 725 from 750

     the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of
pension expense the 025 decrease in the discount rate used at june 29 2002
increased syscos net pension expense for fiscal 2003 by approximately
5500000 the decrease in the discount rate of 125 at june 28 2003 will
increase syscos pension expense for fiscal 2004 by approximately 35300000

     sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase
in compensation levels sysco used a plan specific agerelated set of rates
equivalent to a single rate of 589 as of june 28 2003 and june 29 2002

     the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets was 900 and 950 as
of june 28 2003 and june 29 2002 respectively the expectations of future
returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates
assumptions as to the various asset class returns reflecting a combination of
rigorous historical performance analysis and the forwardlooking views of the
financial markets regarding the yield on longterm bonds and the historical
returns of the major stock markets although not determinative of future
returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets developed using
geometriccompound averaging was 121 75 27 and a negative 143 over
the twentyyear tenyear fiveyear and oneyear periods ended december 31
2002 respectively in addition in nine of the last fifteen years the actual
return on plan assets has exceeded 950 the rate of return assumption is
reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate as it was at june 28 2003
when the expected return was reduced to 900 from 950 and at june 29 2002
when the expected return was reduced to 950 from 1050

     the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of pension
expense the 1 decrease in the assumed rate of return increased syscos net
pension expense for fiscal 2003 by approximately 4900000 the decrease in the
expected return of 050 at june 28 2003 will increase syscos net pension
expense for fiscal 2004 by approximately 3400000

     amortization of unrecognized net asset losses increased pension expense for
fiscal year 2003 by approximately 5800000 and is expected to further increase
pension expense for fiscal year 2004 by approximately 4200000

     changes in assumptions regarding the discount rate together with actual
returns on plan assets below the expected return assumptions resulted in the
company being required to reflect a cumulative adjustment to other comprehensive
income with respect to minimum pension liability of 185118000 net of tax as
of june 28 2003 and 65435000 net of tax as of june 29 2002 minimum
pension liability adjustments are noncash adjustments that are reflected as an
increase in the pension liability and an offsetting charge to shareholders
equity net of tax through comprehensive loss rather than net income

     the companys prepaid pension cost prior to the recognition of the
additional minimum pension liability was 91340000 and 1063000 at june 28
2003 and june 29 2002 respectively included in arriving at accrued benefit
cost as of june 28 2003 and june 29 2002 respectively are 493829000 and
236852000 in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of
actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions a portion of
this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with sfas no
87 in pension expense over time

     the company recognized net pension costs of 74288000 net of an expected
asset return of 44061000 and 51336000 net of an expected asset return of
42039000 for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 respectively changes in the
assumptions together with the normal growth of the plan and the impact of losses
from prior periods increased net pension cost 22952000 in fiscal 2003 and is
expected to increase fiscal 2004 by 39900000

     the companys cash contributions to its pension plans were 164565000 and
83136000 in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 respectively for the past several
years no contributions have been required to be made to the qualified pension
trust as determined by government regulations however sysco has chosen to
voluntarily

                                        19
page

make contributions in fiscal 2004 contributions to the qualified pension trust
will also not be required as determined by government regulations

accounting for business combinations

     goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over
the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and
estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired
including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the
allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit in addition sysco
assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair
values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values the
evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections estimates and
assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a
discounted cash flow analysis as well as assumptions regarding sales and
earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the
industry actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections
resulting in the company revising its assumptions and if required recognizing
an impairment loss

new accounting standards

     sysco adopted the provisions of sfas no 142 accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets effective at the beginning of fiscal 2003 as a
result the amortization of goodwill was discontinued management completed its
assessment of the impact that the adoption of sfas no 142 had on the companys
consolidated financial statements and determined that there was no impairment to
the carrying value of goodwill had goodwill amortization been discontinued for
all the fiscal years reported syscos pro forma net earnings and diluted
earnings per share were 778288000 and 118 in fiscal 2003 694320000 and
103 in fiscal 2002 and 608998000 and 090 in fiscal 2001

     sysco adopted the provisions of sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets effective in fiscal 2003 the
adoption of sfas no 144 has not had a material effect on the companys
consolidated financial statements

     sysco has adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board
fasb interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure
requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of
others this interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair
value and also requires a guarantor to make certain disclosures regarding
guarantees this interpretations initial recognition and initial measurement
provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements became effective
for syscos financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 the
adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on syscos
consolidated financial statements or disclosures

     sysco adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 148 accounting for
stockbased compensation  transition and disclosure in the third quarter of
fiscal 2003 sfas no 148 provides alternative methods of transition to sfas no
123 accounting for stockbased compensation fair value method of accounting
for stockbased employee compensation if a company elects to adopt these
provisions sfas no 148 also specifies required disclosures of an entitys
accounting policy with respect to stockbased employee compensation on reported
net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements

     sysco has adopted the provisions of the emerging issues task force eitf
issue no 0216 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash
consideration received from a vendor the provisions of eitf no 0216 are
effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2002 with certain
provisions effective for arrangements entered into after november 21 2002
syscos historical accounting policies are consistent with the provisions of
eitf no 0216 and thus sysco chose to adopt this accounting policy during the
third quarter of fiscal 2003 eitf no 0216 provides guidance as to the
recognition and classification of monies received from vendors the adoption of
this consensus did not have an impact on syscos consolidated financial
statements

                                        20

     sysco adopted the provisions of the eitf issue 0217 recognition of
customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination
effective october 2002 eitf no 0217 addresses the intangible asset
recognition criteria of sfas no 141 business combinations and provides that
an intangible asset related to customer relationship intangibles may exist even
though the relationship is not evidenced by a contract the adoption of this
consensus did not have a material impact on syscos consolidated financial
statements

     in november 2002 the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 0021
multipledeliverable revenue arrangements eitf no 0021 addresses how to
account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and provides
guidance relating to when such arrangements should be divided into components
for revenue recognition purposes the consensus will be effective for agreements
entered into in fiscal 2004 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this
consensus will not have a material impact on syscos consolidated financial
statements

     in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of
variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin
arb no 51 this interpretation introduces a new consolidation model the
variable interests model which determines control and consolidation based on
potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for
consolidation the interpretations consolidation provisions apply immediately
to variable interests in variable interest entities vies created after
january 31 2003 and apply in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning
after june 15 2003 to vies acquired before february 1 2003 the adoption of
this interpretation will not have a material impact on syscos consolidated
financial statements

risk factors

  low margin business economic sensitivity

     the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high
inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins sysco makes a significant
portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells
plus a percentage markup as a result syscos profit levels may be negatively
impacted during periods of product cost deflation even though syscos gross
profit percentage may remain relatively constant product cost inflation could
also have a negative impact on profit margins if sysco is unable to raise prices
to its customers at the same rate its costs increase the foodservice industry
is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions syscos operating
results are also sensitive to and may be adversely affected by other factors
including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable inventory
control competitive price pressures severe weather conditions and unexpected
increases in fuel or other transportationrelated costs although these factors
have not had a material adverse impact on syscos past operations there can be
no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future
operating results

  leverage and debt service

     because historically a substantial part of syscos growth has been the
result of acquisitions and capital expansion syscos continued growth depends
in large part on its ability to continue this expansion as a result its
inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed
funds could restrict its ability to expand moreover any default under the
documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse
effect on the market value of syscos common stock further syscos leveraged
position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures

  product liability claims

     sysco like any other seller of food faces the risk of exposure to product
liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company
causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims sysco
believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance
however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost
or if available may not be adequate to cover all of syscos liabilities sysco
generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties
supplying

                                        21
page

its products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a
practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the
insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have
adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability
relating to defective products could materially reduce syscos net earnings and
earnings per share

  interruption of supplies

     sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice products from third
party suppliers for the most part sysco does not have longterm contracts with
its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco although syscos
purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers
may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the
quantities requested because sysco does not control the actual production of
the products it sells it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in
production based on conditions outside its control these conditions include job
actions or strikes by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions
transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic
events syscos inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice
products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean
that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers and customers may
turn to other distributors

  labor relations

     as of june 28 2003 approximately 9500 employees at 49 operating
companies were members of 58 different local unions associated with the
international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal
2004 10 agreements covering approximately 1070 employees will expire failure
of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could
result in work stoppages although syscos operating subsidiaries have not
experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and sysco
believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage
due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union
contract or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on sysco

  integration of acquired companies

     if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and
realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner
its profitability may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more
difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or
no expertise or with a corporate culture different from syscos if sysco is
unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully it may incur substantial
costs and delays in increasing its customer base in addition the failure to
integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from
syscos existing business and may damage syscos relationships with its key
customers and suppliers

  charter and stockholder rights plan

     under its restated certificate of incorporation syscos board of directors
is authorized to issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock without
stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for
anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on
the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts
to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the
stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco
pursuant to its stockholder rights plan which could result in substantial
dilution to a potential acquiror the existence of either of these provisions
could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of
sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to syscos
stockholders

forwardlooking statements

     certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express
managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future
events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 they include statements about syscos ability to increase
its

                                        22
page

market share and sales longterm debt to capitalization target ratios
anticipated capital expenditures timing and expected benefits of the national
supply chain initiative and related regional distribution centers and syscos
ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable

     these statements are based on managements current expectations and
estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors
discussed above in addition syscos ability to increase its market share and
sales meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by
conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the
ability to control expenses the ability to meet longterm debt to
capitalization target ratios may also be affected by share repurchases cash
flow acquisitions and internal growth



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes syscos
use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk floating rate
debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes the company to
shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest
rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes the company to changes in
market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk
that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher
rate

     sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of
fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

liquidity and capital resources

     sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers
throughout the united states and canada the company intends to continue to
expand its market share through profitable sales growth foldouts acquisitions
and constant emphasis on the development of its consolidated buying programs
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing
associates and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities
these objectives require continuing investment syscos resources include cash
provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets

     syscos operations historically have produced significant cash flow cash
generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements
investments in facilities fleet and other equipment required to meet customers
needs cash dividends and acquisitions fitting within the companys overall
growth strategy any remaining cash generated from operations may at the
discretion of management be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share
repurchase program while the remainder of the cost may be financed with
additional longterm debt syscos share repurchase program is used primarily to
offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans for
acquisitions and to reduce shares outstanding all of which may have the net
effect of increasing earnings per share management targets a longterm debt to
total capitalization ratio between 35 to 40 the ratio may exceed the target
range from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions
and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and
amount of share repurchases the ratio may also fall below the target range due
to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of
share repurchases this ratio was 356 and 314 at june 29 2002 and june 30
2001 respectively

     the company generated net cash from operations of 1084980000 in fiscal
2002 955224000 in fiscal 2001 and 708726000 in fiscal 2000 the overall
increases in operating results contributed to the annual increases in cash flows
from operations in addition during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the
company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated
efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement
functions performed for the benefit of our customers the new structure resulted
in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments which amounted
to 266673000 for fiscal 2002 and was reflected in the increase in the
deferred tax provision the company expects the positive cash flow effect of the
deferral in fiscal 2003 to increase from fiscal 2002 levels the company expects
the cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal 2004 and beyond to be less than
fiscal 2003 levels as it expects to begin making payments related to these
deferrals in fiscal 2004 the company expects the cash flow impact of deferrals
in fiscal 2004 and beyond to be incrementally positive when compared to what
would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral

     in addition a federal tax payment of 75000000 normally due in the
fourth quarter of 2001 was deferred until the first quarter of 2002 as allowed
by the internal revenue service due to the texas tropical storm allison disaster
and is reflected in the decrease of accrued income taxes in fiscal 2002

338751000 in fiscal 2001 and 459392000 in fiscal 2000 expenditures for
facilities fleet and other equipment were 416393000 in fiscal 2002
341138000 in fiscal 2001 and 266413000 in fiscal 2000 the increase in
fiscal 2002 over prior years is primarily due to the construction and completion
of new foldout facilities located in sacramento california and columbia south
carolina and the ongoing construction of the foldout facility in las vegas
nevada fiscal 2002 expenditures also included costs incurred on the
construction or expansion of facilities in lewisville texas norman oklahoma
baraboo wisconsin and jersey city new jersey total expenditures in fiscal
2003 are expected to increase to the range of 450000000 to 500000000 due

cost of sales

     cost of sales increased approximately 69 in fiscal 2002 119 in fiscal
2001 and 101 in fiscal 2000 the rate of increases were less than the rate of
sales increases leading to improved gross margins the rate of increase is
influenced by syscos overall customer and product mix economies realized in
purchasing and higher sales of sysco brand products

operating expenses

     operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products
as well as selling and administrative expenses these expenses as a percent of
sales were 148 for fiscal 2002 and 2001 and 147 for fiscal 2000 changes in
the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an
interplay of several economic influences including customer mix inflationary
increases in operating costs generally have been offset through improved
productivity

     operating expenses in fiscal 2002 were negatively impacted by increased
costs realized during the initial operating periods of foldouts in sacramento
california columbia south carolina and las vegas nevada

                                        12

below fiscal 2001 which had increased 944000 or approximately 13 over

to decreases in interest rates for shortterm and commercial paper borrowings
interest expense in fiscal 2000 included interest income in the amount of
3000000 related to a federal income tax refund on an amended return after
adjusting for the refund interest expense in the fiscal 2001 period decreased
2056000 or approximately 28 this decrease was due primarily to decreased
borrowings interest capitalized during construction periods for the past three
years was 3746000 in fiscal 2002 2995000 in fiscal 2001 and 964000 in
fiscal 2000

the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities primarily gains
and losses on the sale of surplus facilities

critical accounting policies

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and
expenses in the accompanying financial statements significant accounting
polices employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial
statements

                                        14
page

     critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the
portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations these
policies require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments
often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain syscos most critical accounting policies pertain to the
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable selfinsurance programs pension
plans and accounting for business combinations

  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable

     sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines
the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet
its financial obligation to us we record a specific reserve for bad debts to
reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to
collect and writeoff such amounts at the end of each fiscal year in addition
we recognize reserves for all other receivables based on analysis of historical
trends of writeoffs and recoveries if the financial condition of our customers
were to deteriorate additional reserves may be required

  selfinsurance program

     sysco maintains a selfinsurance program covering portions of workers
compensation group medical general liability and vehicle liability costs the
amounts in excess of the selfinsured levels are fully insured selfinsurance
accruals are based on claims filed and include an estimate for significant
claims incurred but not reported projections of future loss expenses are
inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims
occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims
differ from these assumptions and historical trends in an attempt to mitigate
our risks of workers compensation vehicle and general liability claims we
have implemented safety procedures and awareness programs

  pension plans

     sysco maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans
for its employees the company also contributes to various multiemployer plans
under collective bargaining agreements the defined benefit pension plans pay
benefits to employees at retirement using formulas based on a participants
years of service and compensation sysco also maintains a nonqualified
unfunded supplementary executive retirement plan serp for key employees in
order to meet its obligations under the serp the company maintains life
insurance policies on the lives of participants sysco is the sole owner and
beneficiary of such policies which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at
prepaid accrued benefit cost cash surrender values of such policies were
71418000 at june 29 2002 and 79083000 at june 30 2001

     sysco accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with
sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions as amended by sfas no 132
employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an
amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 and 106 these statements require that
the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial
basis which include assumptions regarding the expected rate of return on plan
assets a discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and
the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels as well
as other assumptions

     for guidance in determining the discount rate sysco looks at rates of
return on highquality fixedincome investments this rate was 725 and 750
as of june 29 2002 and june 30 2001 respectively sysco looks to actual plan
experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels sysco
used a plan specific agerelated set of rates equivalent to a single rate of
589 as of june 29 2002 and june 30 2001 the expected longterm rate of
return on plan assets was 950 and 1050 as of june 29 2002 and june 30
2001 respectively management believes that this assumption is reasonable based
on the investment policy and expectations of future returns for the various
asset classes in which trust assets are invested although not determinative of
future returns the effective annual rate of return on plan assets was 99
93 and a negative 22 over the tenyear fiveyear and oneyear periods ended
december 31 2001 respectively the rate of return assumption is reviewed
annually and revised as deemed appropriate

     the performance of the stock market in 2002 and 2001 resulted in a decline
in the value of the assets held by the pension plans as a result the company
was required to reflect a minimum pension liability of 65435000 net of tax
as of june 29 2002 and 5624000 net of tax as of june 30 2001 minimum
pension liability adjustments are noncash adjustments that are reflected as an
increase in the pension liability and on offsetting charge to shareholders
equity net of tax through comprehensive loss rather than net income

     the companys prepaid benefit cost prior to the recognition of the
additional minimum pension liability was 1063000 at june 29 2002 and its
accrued benefit cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension
liability was 30736000 at june 30 2001 included in arriving at accrued
benefit cost are 236852000 in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from
the variance of actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions
a portion of this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance
with sfas no 87 in pension expense over time the company recognized net
pension costs of 51336000 and 30359000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2001
respectively

  accounting for business combinations

     goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over
the fair value of tangible net assets acquired certain assumptions and
estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired
including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the
allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit in addition sysco
assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the
amortization of these intangibles over their remaining lives can be recovered
through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired operations the
amount of impairment if any is measured by the amount in which the carrying
amounts exceed the projected discounted future operating cash flows sysco will
adopt sfas no 142 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in
fiscal year 2003 which discontinues the amortization of goodwill and indefinite
life intangibles and requires an annual test of impairment based on a comparison
of fair value to carrying values the evaluation of impairment under both the
existing rules and sfas no 142 requires the use of projections estimates and
assumptions as to the future performance of the operations actual results could
differ from projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and
if required recognizing an impairment loss based on a preliminary assessment
sysco does not believe its goodwill is impaired and does not expect to record a
charge from the adoption of sfas no 142

  new accounting standards

     in fiscal 2000 sysco adopted the aicpa statement of position 981 sop
981 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for
internal use sop 981 provides guidance with respect to accounting for the
various types of costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for
syscos use the adoption of sop 981 did not have a significant effect on
syscos consolidated results of operations or financial position

     in fiscal 2001 sysco adopted the financial accounting standards boards
fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 137 accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities  deferral of the effective
date of sfas no 133 and sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative
instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 133
these statements outline the accounting treatment for all derivative activity
and their adoption did not have a significant effect on syscos consolidated
results of operations or financial position

accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition sab 101 provides
guidance on the recognition presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements the adoption of sab 101 had no effect on syscos consolidated
results of operations or financial position

adopting the provisions of sfas no 142 accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets effective with the beginning of fiscal year 2003 as a
result the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles will be
discontinued goodwill and indefinite life intangibles arising from business
combinations after june 30 2001 are also not amortized the recoverability of
goodwill and intangibles will be assessed annually or as needed by determining
whether the fair value of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying
values sysco has six months from the date it adopts sfas no 142 to test for
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle thereafter any
impairment losses will be included net of tax within the results of continuing
operations management has completed its preliminary assessment of the impact
that the adoption of sfas no 142 will have on the companys consolidated
financial statements and believes that goodwill is not impaired goodwill
amortization after tax recognized by sysco was 14533000 in 2002
12089000 in 2001 and 7812000 in 2000

     in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of long  lived assets sfas 144 supersedes sfas 121
and the portion of the accounting principle board opinion no 30 that deals with
disposal of a business segment management does not expect sfas 144 which is
effective for fiscal 2003 to have a material effect on the results of
operations

risk factors

  low margin business economic sensitivity

     the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high
inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins sysco makes a significant
portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells
plus a percentage markup as a result syscos profit levels may be negatively
impacted during periods of food price deflation even though syscos gross
profit percentage may remain relatively constant the foodservice industry is
sensitive to national and regional economic conditions syscos operating
results are also sensitive to and may be adversely affected by other factors
including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable inventory
control competitive price pressures severe weather conditions and unexpected
increases in fuel or other transportationrelated costs although these factors
have not had a material adverse impact on syscos past operations there can be
no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future
operating results

  leverage and debt service

     because historically a substantial part of syscos growth has been the
result of acquisitions and capital expansion syscos continued growth depends
in large part on its ability to continue this expansion as a result its
inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed
funds could restrict its ability to expand moreover any default under the
documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse
effect on the market value of syscos common stock further syscos leveraged
position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures

  product liability claims

     sysco like any other seller of food faces the risk of exposure to product
liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company
causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims sysco
believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance
however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost
or if available may not be adequate to cover all of syscos liabilities sysco
generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties
supplying its products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is
limited as a practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying
party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco
does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available
product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce syscos
net income and earnings per share

                                        17
page

  interruption of supplies

     sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice products from third
party suppliers for the most part sysco does not have longterm contracts with
its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco although syscos
purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers
may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the
quantities requested because sysco does not control the actual production of
the products it sells it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in
production based on conditions outside its control these conditions include job
actions or strikes by employees of suppliers weather crop conditions
transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic
events syscos inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice
products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean
that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers and customers may
turn to other distributors

  labor relations

     as of june 29 2002 approximately 9700 employees at 50 operating
companies were members of 59 different local unions associated with the
international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations in fiscal
2003 14 agreements covering approximately 2130 employees will expire failure
of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could
result in work stoppages although syscos operating subsidiaries have not
experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date and sysco
believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions a work stoppage
due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union
contract or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on sysco

  integration of acquired companies

     if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and
realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner
its profitability may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more
difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or
no expertise or with a corporate culture different from syscos if sysco is
unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully it may incur substantial
costs and delays in increasing its customer base in addition the failure to
integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from
syscos existing business and may damage syscos relationships with its key
customers and suppliers

  charter and stockholder rights plan

     under its restated certificate of incorporation syscos board of directors
is authorized to issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock without
stockholder approval issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for
anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors depending on
the rights and preferences of the stock issued in addition if anyone attempts
to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the
stockholders of sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco
pursuant to its stockholder rights plan which could result in substantial
dilution to a potential acquiror the existence of either of these provisions
could deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of
sysco that could otherwise have been financially beneficial to syscos
stockholders

forwardlooking statements

     certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express
managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future
events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 they include statements about syscos ability to increase
its market share and sales longterm debt to capitalization target ratios
anticipated capital expenditures and syscos ability to meet future cash
requirements and remain profitable

     these statements are based on managements current expectations and
estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors
discussed above in addition syscos ability to increase its market share and
sales meet future cash requirements and remain profitable could be affected by
conditions
                                        18

in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to
control expenses the ability to meet longterm debt to capitalization target
ratios may also be affected by share repurchases cash flow acquisitions and
internal growth



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes syscos
use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk floating rate
debt where the interest rate fluctuates periodically exposes the company to
shortterm changes in market interest rates fixed rate debt where the interest
rate is fixed over the life of the instrument exposes the company to changes in
the market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the
risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt

     sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of
fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve
that goal the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the
interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments potential increases
in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the
creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions at june 29 2002
the company had outstanding one interest rate swap agreement whereby sysco
exchanged the fixed interest payments on the 200000000 principal amount of
475 notes for floating interest payments at june 29 2002 the company had
outstanding 63293000 of commercial paper at variable rates of interest with
maturities through september 3 2002 the companys longterm debt obligations
of 1190061000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest except for
200000000 in fixed rate debt swapped to a floating rate of interest as
discussed above

sources of supply

     sysco estimates that it purchases from thousands of independent sources
none of which individually account for more than 5 of the companys purchases
these sources of supply consist generally of large corporations selling brand
name and private label merchandise and independent private label processors and
packers generally purchasing is carried out on a decentralized basis through
centrally developed purchasing programs see corporate headquarters services
and controls below and direct purchasing programs

                                        2

approximately 31 of the companys union employees expire during fiscal 2001
sysco considers its labor relations to be satisfactory

competition

     the business of sysco is competitive with numerous companies engaged in
foodservice distribution while competition is encountered primarily from local
and regional distributors a few companies compete with sysco on a national
basis the company believes that although price and customer contact are
important considerations the principal competitive factor in the foodservice
industry is the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related
services on a timely and dependable basis although syscos share of the
foodservice industry market in the united states and canada was approximately
11 as of july 1 2000 sysco believes based upon industry trade data that its
sales to the us foodpreparedawayfromhome industry were the largest of
any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2000 while adequate industry
statistics are not available the company believes that in most instances its
local operations are among the leading distributors of food and related nonfood
products to foodservice customers in their respective trading areas

issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans the company
significantly accelerated the repurchase program beginning in february 1996 the
share repurchase program reduces outstanding shares and increases earnings per
share the longterm debt to total capitalization target ratio was increased
from a range of 30 to 40 to a range of 35 to 40 due to prior and anticipated
accelerated share repurchases additional debt associated with those repurchases
and acquisitions this ratio was 368 and 411 at july 1 2000 and july 3
1999 respectively

     the annual increases in sales of 11 in 2000 and 14 in 1999 53 weeks
resulted from several factors sales in fiscal 2000 and 1999 were affected by
the strong growth in the us economy as well as in the foodservice industry
after adjusting for food price increases acquisitions and adjusted for the
extra week in fiscal 1999 real sales growth was about 9 in 2000 and 12 in
1999 acquisitions represented 35 of total sales for fiscal 2000 food costs
which experienced minimal inflation during the first two quarters of 2000 and a
slight deflation during the third quarter returned to about 2 inflation during
the final quarter resulting in approximately 04 inflation for fiscal 2000
this compares to an increase of approximately 1 in fiscal 1999 industry
sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced real growth of
approximately 31 in calendar year 1999 and 28 in calendar year 1998

cost of sales

     cost of sales increased about 10 in 2000 and 14 in 1999 these increases
were generally in line with the increases in sales the rate of increase is
influenced by syscos overall customer and product mix as well as economies
realized in product acquisition and higher sales of sysco brand products

operating expenses

     operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products
as well as selling and administrative expenses these expenses as a percent of
sales were 147 for fiscal 2000 and 146 for fiscal 1999 and for fiscal 1998
part of the increase over 1999 was due to expenses related to the closing of a
facility and onetime nonrecurring costs associated with the completion of the
sysco uniform systems implementation there was also a charge to nonoperating
expenses in connection with the facility closing the costs described above were
approximately 13000000 otherwise changes in the percentage relationship of
operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several economic
influences including customer mix inflationary increases in operating costs
generally have been offset through improved productivity

interest expense

     interest expense decreased 2007000 or approximately 3 in fiscal 2000 as
compared to an increase of 14417000 or approximately 25 in fiscal 1999 the
decrease in fiscal 2000 was due primarily to interest income received in the
amount of 3000000 related to a federal income tax refund on an amended tax
return without this income interest expense would have been approximately 1
above last year due to increased borrowings the increase in fiscal 1999 was due
primarily to increased borrowings principally to fund the share repurchase
program and the replacement of floating rate debt at higher fixed rates
interest capitalized during the past three years was 964000 in fiscal 2000
1812000 in fiscal 1999 and 2095000 in fiscal 1998

other net

     other decreased 559000 or about 58 in fiscal 2000 and decreased 910000
or about 1717 in fiscal 1999 changes between the years result from
fluctuations in miscellaneous activities primarily gains and losses on the sale
of surplus facilities as well as the expenses related to the facility closing
discussed under operating expenses above

earnings before income taxes

     earnings before income taxes rose 143721000 or approximately 24 above
fiscal 1999 which had increased 61394000 or approximately 12 over the
prior year additional sales and realization of operating efficiencies
contributed to the increases as well as the companys success in its continued
efforts to increase sales to the companys higher margin marketing
associateserved customers and increasingly higher sales of sysco brand
products

                                        7
page   10

provision for income taxes

     the effective tax rate for 2000 was 385 and for 1999 was approximately
39

earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change

     fiscal 2000 represents the twentyfourth consecutive year of increased
earnings before the cumulative effect of an accounting change earnings before
cumulative effect of accounting change rose 91358000 or approximately 25
above fiscal 1999 which had increased 37450000 or approximately 12 over
the prior year

cumulative effect of accounting change

     in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 sysco recorded a onetime aftertax
noncash charge of 8041000 to comply with the required adoption of aicpa
statement of position 985 sop 985 reporting on the costs of startup
activities sop 985 requires the writeoff of any unamortized costs of
startup activities and organization costs going forward such costs are being
expensed as incurred

net earnings

     net earnings for the year increased 83317000 or approximately 23 above
fiscal 1999 which had increased 65503000 or approximately 22 over the prior
year the increase was caused by additional sales operating efficiencies and
other factors discussed above

dividends

     sysco began paying the quarterly dividend rate of twelve cents per share in
february 2000 an increase from the ten cents per share that became effective in
february 1999

return on shareholders equity

     the return on average shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of
the accounting change for 2000 was approximately 29 compared to 26 in 1999 and
23 in 1998 since inception sysco has averaged in excess of a 17 return on
shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of the accounting change


broadline segment



     broadline segment sales increased by 79 in fiscal 2000 as compared to
fiscal 1999 and by 107 in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998 the fiscal
2000 and 1999 sales growth was affected primarily by growth in existing
operating company sales broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco
sales decreased from 885 in fiscal 1999 to 862 in fiscal 2000 and from
909 in fiscal 1998 to 885 in fiscal 1999 the decrease in fiscal 2000 was
due primarily to acquisitions of specialty meat and produce companies in the
other segments the decrease in fiscal 1999 was due primarily to the addition of
the wendys business in the sygma segment



     pretax earnings for the broadline segment increased by 202 in fiscal 2000
as compared to fiscal 1999 and by 137 in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal
1998 the increase in pretax earnings for fiscal 2000 was driven by increased
sales to marketing associateserved customers as well as increases in sales of
sysco brand products completion of the installation of sysco uniform systems in
the second quarter of fiscal 2000 has also impacted pretax earnings with
increased efficiencies and productivity



sygma segment



     sygma segment sales increased by 76 in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal
1999 and by 438 in fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998 the fiscal 2000 and
1999 sales growth was affected by the factors listed above as well as the
addition of the wendys business in fiscal 1999 sygma segment sales as a


                                        8
page   11


percentage of total sysco sales decreased from 115 in fiscal 1999 to 112 in
fiscal 2000 and increased from 91 in fiscal 1998 to 115 in fiscal 1999 the
decrease in fiscal 2000 was due primarily to acquisitions of specialty meat and
produce companies in the other segments the increase in fiscal 1999 was due to
the addition of the wendys business pretax earnings for the segment decreased
by 588 in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 and 81 in fiscal 1999 as
compared to fiscal 1998 the decrease in pretax earnings in fiscal 2000 was due
primarily to an 83 million charge incurred in connection with the closing of a
sygma facility the decrease in pretax earnings in fiscal 1999 was due primarily
to costs incurred in connection with the addition of the wendys business



other segments



     increases in sales and pretax earnings for the other segments were due
primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods presented



new accounting standards



     in fiscal 1998 sysco adopted sfas no 130 reporting comprehensive
income the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on syscos
reported net earnings as sysco has no components of other comprehensive income
under the statement



     in fiscal 1999 sysco adopted sfas 131 disclosure about segments of an
enterprise and related information adoption of this standard had no effect on
syscos consolidated results of operations or financial position but revises
the disclosure requirements for segment reporting



     in fiscal 1999 sysco adopted sfas no 132 employers disclosures about
pensions and other postretirement benefits this statement does not change the
measurement or recognition of those plans but revises the disclosure
requirements for pensions and other postretirement plans



     in fiscal 2000 sysco adopted the aicpa issued statement of position sop
981 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for
internal use the sop provides guidance with respect to accounting for the
various types of costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for
syscos use the adoption of this sop did not have a significant effect on
syscos consolidated results of operations or financial position



     in june 1998 june 1999 and june 2000 the financial accounting standards
board issued sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities sfas no 137 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities  deferral of the effective date of sfas no 133 and sfas no 138
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging
activities  an amendment of sfas no 133 these statements outline the
accounting treatment for all derivative activity sysco is required to and will
adopt sfas no 133 in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 and does not expect
adoption to have a significant effect on its consolidated results of operations
or financial position



     in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission staff released
staff accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition the sab provides
guidance on the recognition presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements sysco is required to and will adopt sab 101 in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2001 and believes that adoption will not have a significant effect on its
consolidated results of operations or financial position


risk factors

  low margin business economic sensitivity

     the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high
inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins sysco makes a significant
portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells
plus a percentage markup as a result syscos profit levels may be negatively
impacted during periods of food price deflation even though syscos gross
profit percentage may remain relatively constant the foodservice industry is
sensitive to national and economic conditions syscos operating

                                        9
page   12

results also are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by other factors
including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable inventory
control competitive price pressures severe weather conditions and unexpected
increases in fuel or other transportationrelated costs although such factors
have not had a material adverse impact on syscos past operations there can be
no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future
operating results

  leverage and debt service

     because historically a substantial part of syscos growth has been the
result of acquisitions and capital expansion syscos continued growth depends
in large part on its ability to continue this expansion as a result its
inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed
funds could restrict its ability to expand moreover any default under the
documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse
effect on the market value of syscos common stock further syscos leveraged
position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures

  product liability claims

     sysco like any other seller of food faces the risk of exposure to product
liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company
causes injury or illness with respect to product liability claims sysco
believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance
however this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost
or if available may not be adequate to cover liabilities sysco generally
seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying
its products but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited as a
practical matter to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the
insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers if sysco does not have
adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available product liability
relating to defective products could materially reduce syscos net income and
earnings per share

  interruption of supplies

     sysco obtains all of its foodservice products from other suppliers for the
most part sysco does not have longterm contracts with any supplier committing
it to provide products to sysco although syscos purchasing volume can provide
leverage when dealing with suppliers suppliers may not provide the foodservice
products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities requested because sysco
does not control the actual production of its products it is also subject to
delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its
control these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of
suppliers weather crop conditions transportation interruptions and natural
disasters or other catastrophic events syscos inability to obtain adequate
supplies of its foodservice products as a result of any of the foregoing factors
or otherwise could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to
customers and customers may turn to other distributors

  labor relations

     as of july 1 2000 approximately 8000 employees were members of 48
different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of
teamsters and other labor organizations at 34 operating companies in fiscal
2001 14 agreements covering approximately 2500 employees will expire failure
to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages
although sysco has not experienced any significant labor disputes or work
stoppages to date and believes it has satisfactory relationships with its
unions a work stoppage due to failure to renegotiate a union contract or
otherwise could have a material adverse effect on sysco

  integration of acquired companies

     if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and
realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner
its profitability may decrease integration of an acquired business may be more
difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or
no

                                        10
page   13

expertise or with a corporate culture different from syscos if sysco is
unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully it may incur substantial
costs and delays in increasing its customer base in addition the failure to
integrate acquisitions successfully may divert managements attention from
syscos existing business and may damage syscos relationships with its key
customers and suppliers

  charter and stockholder rights plan

     under its restated certificate of incorporation syscos board of directors
is authorized to issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock without
stockholder approval issuance of these shares would make it more difficult for
anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors because more
shares would have to be acquired to gain control if anyone attempts to acquire
sysco without approval of the board of directors of sysco the stockholders of
sysco have the right to purchase preferred stock of sysco which also means more
shares would have to be acquired to gain control both of these devices may
deter hostile takeover attempts that might result in an acquisition of sysco
that would have been financially beneficial to syscos stockholders

forwardlooking statements

     certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express
managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future
events are forwardlooking statements under the private securities litigation
reform act of 1995 they include statements about anticipated industry growth
syscos longterm growth objectives anticipated capital expenditures and
implementation and timing of foldouts and acquisitions

     these statements are based on current expectations and management
estimates actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors
discussed above in addition decisions to pursue foldouts and acquisitions
and expenditures for such could vary depending upon construction schedules and
the timing of other purchases such as fleet and equipment while the timing and
implementation of foldouts and acquisitions could be impacted by competitive
conditions labor issues and other matters the ability to pursue acquisitions
also depends upon the availability and suitability of potential candidates and
managements allocation of capital industry growth and syscos longterm growth
objectives could be affected by conditions in the economy the industry and
internal factors that may alter planned results



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk


     sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and holds
no derivative financial instruments which could expose the company to
significant market risk syscos exposure to market risk for changes in interest
rates relates primarily to its longterm obligations discussed above at july 1
2000 the company had outstanding commercial paper of 247870000 with
maturities through september 22 2000 the companys remaining longterm debt
obligations of 775772000 were primarily at fixed rates of interest sysco has
no significant cash flow exposure due to interest rate changes for longterm
debt obligations
