human capital 

our more than 58000 employees are a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and serve our customers we believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our customers and investors therefore it is critical to our success that we are able to identify attract hire and retain delivery professionals who are highly skilled in information technology to execute our services as well as individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive finance legal human resources and other key management positions to attract retain and motivate our employees we offer a challenging work environment a culture that values the individual ongoing skills development initiatives attractive career advancement with continuous rotation and promotion opportunities while providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we had a total of 58824 41168 and 36739 employees respectively of which 52617 36737 and 32561 respectively were delivery professionals

recognizing that the lingering uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic and remote work could continue to significantly disrupt the worklife balance and wellness of our employees we increased employee awareness of the programs we offer to support and enhance our employees’ mental financial and physical wellbeing and provided parenting and caregiver resources 

recruitment training and utilization as an innovationdriven business in a competitive industry our success depends on hiring the most talented employees training and developing that talent and deploying them to satisfy customer demand we have dedicated fulltime employees who oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including talent acquisition teams to locate and attract qualified and experienced professionals around the world our employees are a critical asset necessary for our continued success and therefore we are continuously exploring new geographies markets and sources to locate talented personnel and appealing to them with competitive compensation programs and educational opportunities 

we actively monitor how we utilize our delivery professionals and specialists to balance the needs of our customers with the availability location and skill sets of our employees and their need for diverse and challenging work we manage utilization through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects for our customers as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the annual utilization rates of our delivery professionals were approximately 787 798 and 780 respectively 

epam invests significant resources in training and developing our employees through our learning and development programs our largest learning and development investment has been directed towards developing our engineering talent including targeted training programs innovation labs and significant internal production projects our employees consumed over 37 million learning hours in 2021 and we were awarded linkedin’s best culture of learning talent award for 2021 we deliver training and development opportunities and content through our unique learning ecosystem that promotes learning in the daily workflow to improve retention and productivity and through dedicated events including our weeklong global learning event which delivered approximately 100 online sessions

diversity and inclusion epam provides our customers with the skills of our talented personnel which includes people with varied and diverse backgrounds and characteristics to drive innovation and thought diversity in delivering our services we believe that innovation comes from the unique perspectives knowledge and experiences of our global employees so we strive to create inclusivity by offering comprehensive language learning programs highlighting and sharing our varied cultures and empowering women and underrepresented groups to celebrate their achievements in the workplace 

increasing diversity in executive and key operational leadership roles is an organizational priority that starts at the top of our organization women currently represent approximately 29 of the independent directors on our board and we have developed programs to identify retain mentor and supply a pipeline of qualified diverse candidates at all levels of our company our programs include dedicating resources and personnel in our talent acquisition team to identify recognize and use diverse and inclusive sources for hiring including associating with organizations that are focused on promoting underrepresented groups in engineering it and business our emerging engineers lab is an internship program for entrylevel talent sourced from a variety of diverse technology programs across the us canada and mexico we also supplemented our mandatory annual training with materials geared towards eliminating unconscious bias in our professional interactions and recognizing the value of diversity in organizational success 

our employees have driven the creation of discussion forums focused on diversity and inclusion topics important to them and organized participation in global and local events including international women’s day pride celebrations and national hispanic heritage month recognizing that improving the number of underrepresented people in the software and technology industries starts with access to science technology engineering and mathematics “stem” education epam has created postsecondary stem education certification programs and is investing in universities that offer degree programs we also created the epam ekids program where our employees volunteer their time to teach elementary school age children of any gender race or ethnic identity stem concepts and introductory software coding skills as of the end of 2021 we offered the epam ekids program in 14 countries 

employee engagement and retention we are committed to respecting our employees fundamental human rights at work and accordingly are a participant in the united nations global compact we believe that retaining skilled talent requires substantially more than meeting basic employment and labor rights and that employees who are fairly compensated feel supported in their career development and are engaged with their employer are more likely to remain with that employer that is why we strive to provide pay and benefits that demonstrate the value of our employees to us including a competitive salary flexible worklife balance paid time off health coverage ongoing training programs relocation options and recognition opportunities for open source software contributions 

our career development programs create detailed and progressive training plans for our employees and help them choose from internal and external training options mentoring programs and handson opportunities to experience emerging technology areas we designed our career development programs to enable our employees to develop their engineering skills influence our culture develop thought leadership and introduce them to leaders in our industry our career development programs also give our employees opportunities to earn accreditation and relevant expertise in various technology fields including software and project management certifications and recognition and credentialing from the industry’s primary software and cloud services providers

we endeavor to recruit for careers not for shortterm projects and actively foster feedback from our employees so we can improve the epam employee experience our employees have demonstrated their satisfaction with our approach by giving their highest percentage of positive responses in our 2021 employee survey when asked if their manager demonstrates a commitment to building a trusting work environment 95 and if they feel that epam provides a supportive environment for all employees regardless of location level function gender age race ethnicity or disability 94 receiving and learning from employee feedback plays a critical role in engaging and retaining our employees because it offers us an opportunity to improve our operations and for our employees to continually enhance their skills

we maintain a marketing team which coordinates corporatelevel branding efforts such as participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events as well as sponsorship of programming competitions we have been recognized by many top global independent research agencies such as forrester and gartner and by publications such as newsweek forbes and fortune 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as eastern europe india and china we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings a reputation for and a track record of highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to customers’ business needs ability to scale financial stability and price

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock listed below not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence are the most significant risk factors applicable to us additionally forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “forwardlooking statements” 

risks related to covid19 

our results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has contributed to significant volatility in the price of our common stock created uncertainty in customer demand for and ability to supply our services and caused widespread economic disruption the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will continue to impact our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous factors that frequently change or are unknown and that we may not be able to accurately predict those factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals’ responses or planned responses to the pandemic including availability administration rates and acceptance of vaccines and therapeutics and the availability of diagnostic supplies the impact of the pandemic on economic activity supply chains and inflation any interventions or government measures intended to mitigate economic and supply disruptions the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products services and solutions our ability to sell and provide our products services and solutions including as a result of travel restrictions and personnel availability the ability of our customers to pay timely if at all for our services and solutions with or without discounts requested by our customers bankruptcy or other insolvency procedures among our customers or suppliers and closures of our and our customers’ offices and facilities restrictions on access to our customers and their facilities and broad disruptions in our customers’ markets  has disrupted and could continue to disrupt the demand for our products services and solutions and result in among other things termination of customer contracts delays or interruptions in the performance of contracts losses of revenues reduced profitability and an increase in bad debt expense customers have and may continue to slow or halt decision making delay planned work or suspend terminate fail to renew or reduce existing contracts or services travel and immigration restrictions may delay or prevent our personnel from accessing worksites and remote working arrangements increase information security cyber security and connectivity vulnerabilities in addition new coronavirus variants and eased covid19related restrictions on businesses and consumers could affect our ability to deliver services to our customers because of an outbreak of illness among our employees our customers’ employees or at a facility moreover there may be additional costs that we will have to incur in connection with further changes in response to the covid19 pandemic or a return to prior operating conditions to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section of this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2021 including but not limited to those relating to our operations in emerging markets our ability to execute on our growth strategy through strategic acquisitions our dependency on third parties for network infrastructure attracting hiring and retaining personnel the effects on movements in foreign currency exchange rates and the effects that changes to fiscal political regulatory and other federal policies may have on epam each of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

risks related to our personnel and growth 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management systems resources and results of operations 

we have grown rapidly and significantly expanded our businesses over the past several years both organically and through strategic acquisitions and investments our growth has resulted in part from managing larger and more complex projects for our customers but consequently requires that we invest substantial amounts of cash in human capital and the infrastructure to support them including training administration and facilities our rapid growth places significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure and creates challenges including 

• recruiting training and retaining sufficiently skilled professionals and management personnel 

• planning resource utilization rates on a consistent basis and efficiently using onsite offsite and offshore staffing 

• maintaining close and effective relationships with a larger number of customers in a greater number of industries and locations 

• controlling costs and minimizing cost overruns and project delays in delivery center and infrastructure expansion 

• effectively maintaining productivity levels and implementing process improvements across geographies and business units and 

• evolving our information security and our internal administrative operational and financial infrastructure 

we intend to continue our expansion and pursue available opportunities for the foreseeable future we have and will continue to invest in new lines of business such as software development education and expanded consulting services as we introduce new services enter into new markets and take on increasingly large and complex projects our business may face new risks and challenges if customers do not choose us for large and complex projects or we do not effectively manage those projects our reputation may be damaged and our business and financial goals may not be realized directtoconsumer offerings in the highly regulated professional education industry could result in increased liability and compliance costs we need to generate business and revenues to support new investments and infrastructure projects if the challenges associated with expansion negatively impact our anticipated growth and margins our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we must successfully attract hire train and retain qualified personnel to service our customers’ projects and we must productively utilize those personnel to remain profitable 

identifying recruiting hiring and retaining professionals with diverse skill sets across our broad geography of operations is critical to maintaining existing engagements and obtaining new business and has become more challenging in the economic and labor climate caused by the covid19 pandemic if we are unable to recruit skilled professionals and if we do not deploy those professionals and use our physical infrastructure and fixedcost resources productively our profitability will be significantly impacted we must manage the utilization levels of the professionals that we hire and train by planning for future needs effectively and staffing projects appropriately while accurately predicting the general economy and our customers’ need for our services if we are unable to attract hire train and retain highly skilled personnel and productively deploy them on customer projects we will jeopardize our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and develop ongoing and future business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

competition for highly skilled professionals has intensified in the markets where we operate and we may experience significant employee turnover rates due to such competition if we are unable to retain professionals with specialized skills our revenues operating efficiency and profitability will decrease cost reductions such as reducing headcount or voluntary departures that result from our failure to retain the professionals we hire could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire personnel to meet our business requirements price increases resulting from increasing compensation to retain personnel could lead to a decline in demand for our services 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of some of our personnel or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

in several countries certain of our personnel and certain of the personnel of companies that we have acquired are retained as independent contractors the criteria to determine whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary by jurisdiction as can the interpretation of the applicable laws if a government authority changes the applicable laws or a court makes any adverse determination with respect to independent contractors in general or one or more of our independent contractors specifically we could incur significant costs including for prior periods for tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and increase the difficulty in attracting and retaining personnel 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions we may not be able to replace them easily or at all if any of our senior executives or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose customers suppliers knowhow and other key personnel to those competitors if we are unable to attract new senior executives or key personnel due to the intense competition for talent in our industry it could disrupt our business operations and growth 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently and effectively or if acquisitions do not perform to our expectations our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

strategic acquisitions are part of our expansion strategy but these transactions involve significant risks acquired companies may not advance our business strategy or achieve a satisfactory return on our investment we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired employees and business culture customer relationships or operations and acquisitions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business furthermore contracts between our acquired companies and their customers may lack terms and conditions that adequately protect us against the risks associated with the services we provide and our acquired companies business operations can expose us to potential liability before integration is complete if not effectively managed the disruption of our ongoing business increases in our expenses including significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and difficulty and complexity of effectively integrating acquired operations may adversely affect our overall growth and profitability 

risks related to our operations 

instability in geographies where we have significant operations and personnel or where we derive substantial amounts of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business customers service delivery and financial results 

economic civil military and political uncertainty exists and may increase in many of the regions where we operate and derive our revenue several countries in which we operate are experiencing and may continue to experience military action and civil and political unrest we have significant operations in the emerging market economies of eastern europe and more than half of our global delivery administrative and support personnel are located in ukraine belarus and russia 

in late february 2022 russian military forces launched significant military action against ukraine and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely the impact to ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries including new and stricter sanctions by canada the united kingdom the european union the us and other countries and organizations against officials individuals regions and industries in russia ukraine and belarus and each country’s potential response to such sanctions tensions and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations in order to protect against potential cyberattacks or other information security threats some of our customers are considering or have implemented steps to block internet communications with russia ukraine and belarus which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver our services from those locations any such material adverse effect from the conflict and enhanced sanctions activity may disrupt our delivery of services cause us to shift all or portions of our work occurring in the region to other countries and may restrict our ability to engage in certain projects in the region or involving certain customers in the region 

epam is actively monitoring and enhancing the security of our people and the stability of our infrastructure including communications and internet availability we execute our business continuity plans and adapt to developments as they occur to protect the safety of our personnel and address potential impacts to our delivery infrastructure to date we have not experienced any material interruptions in our infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our customers we have developed and in some cases implemented additional contingency plans to relocate work andor personnel to other geographies within our global footprint and add new locations as appropriate our business continuity plans are designed to address known contingency scenarios to ensure that we have adequate processes and practices in place to protect the safety of our people and to handle potential impacts to our delivery capabilities our crisis management procedures business continuity plans and disaster recovery capabilities may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of prolonged or multiple crises such as civil unrest military conflict and a pandemic in a concentrated geographic area the current events in the regions where we operate and where we derive a significant amount of our business may pose security risks to our people our facilities our operations and infrastructure such as utilities and network services and the disruption of any or all of them could materially adversely affect our operations financial results and cause volatility in the price of our stock we have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the military action in ukraine or its impacts in russia and belarus as the conflict and government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control whether in these countries or in others in which we operate prolonged civil unrest political instability or uncertainty military activities or broadbased sanctions should they continue for the long term or escalate could require us to rebalance our geographic concentrations and could have a material adverse effect on our personnel operations and business outlook 

increases in wages equity compensation and other compensation expenses could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage increase our costs and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wages for technology professionals in the emerging markets where we have significant operations and delivery centers are lower than comparable wages in more developed countries however wages in general and in the technology industry in these countries in particular increased at a faster rate than in the past which may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our people if we increase operations and hiring in more developed economies our compensation expenses will increase because of the higher wages demanded by technology professionals in those markets wage inflation whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary course pay increases may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability if we are not able to pass those costs on to our customers or adjust prices when justified by market demand 

we expect to continue our practice of granting equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and paying other stockbased compensation the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may make issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plans less attractive to us but if we reduce the amount or value of equity award grants we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel conversely if we grant more or higher value equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the equity compensation expenses could materially adversely affect our results of operations new regulations volatility in our stock and dilution to our stockholders could diminish our use and the value of our equitybased awards this could put us at a competitive disadvantage or cause us to reconsider our compensation practices 

our operations in emerging markets subject us to greater economic financial and banking risks than we would face in more developed markets 

our significant operations in emerging market economies in eastern europe india and certain other asian countries are vulnerable to market and economic volatility to a greater extent than more developed markets which presents risks to our business and operations a majority of our revenues are generated in north america and western europe however most of our personnel and delivery centers are located in lower cost locations including emerging markets this exposes us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues compensation purchases capital expenditures receivables and other balancesheet items as we continue to leverage and expand our global delivery model into other emerging markets a larger portion of our revenues and incurred expenses may be in currencies other than us dollars currency exchange volatility caused by economic instability or other factors could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

the economies of certain emerging market countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns we have cash in banks in countries such as belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan georgia armenia and uzbekistan where the banking sector generally does not meet the banking standards of more developed markets bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured and the banking system remains subject to instability armed conflict or the threat of armed conflict involving belarus russia or ukraine could contribute to a banking crisis in these countries a banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that receive or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to complete banking transactions in that region in addition some countries where we operate may impose regulatory or practical restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies within their banking systems which would limit our ability to use cash across our global operations and increase our exposure to currency fluctuations emerging market vulnerability and especially its impact on currency exchange volatility and banking systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense and increasing competition for customers and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services and other consulting companies if we are unable to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the market for our services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations customers tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues or place significant downward pressure on pricing among competing it services providers customers may prefer service providers that have more locations more personnel more experience in a particular country or market or that are based in countries that are more costcompetitive or have the perception of being more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate 

current or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore service providers which could harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our customers operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources therefore we may be unable to retain our customers or successfully attract new customers increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business 

complying with a wide variety of legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate can create risks to our operations and financial condition including liquidation of the subsidiaries that operate our major delivery centers 

our global operations require us to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions inflation unstable civil political and military situations labor issues and legal systems that make it more difficult to enforce intellectual property contractual or corporate rights certain legal provisions in russia belarus and ukraine where our local subsidiaries operate important delivery centers and employ a significant number of billable and support professionals may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if we fail to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of our local subsidiaries in court and creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims demand early performance of legal obligations and demand compensation for any damages involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided to companies in our industry by the governments of belarus and other countries 

in belarus one local subsidiary is a member along with other technology companies of hightechnologies park members have a full exemption from belarus income tax and value added tax until 2049 and are taxed at reduced amounts on obligatory social contributions and a variety of other taxes in russia our local subsidiary along with other qualified it companies benefit from paying obligatory social contributions to the government at a significantly reduced rate as well as an exemption from value added tax in certain circumstances if these tax benefits are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our operating expenses andor our effective income tax rate could increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provision for income taxes” 

risks related to regulation and legislation 

existing policy and substantial changes to fiscal political regulatory and other federal policies may adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in general economic or political conditions in the united states could adversely affect our business us policy with respect to a variety of issues including international trade agreements conducting business offshore import and export regulations tariffs and customs duties foreign relations immigration laws and travel restrictions antitrust controls and enforcement and corporate governance laws could have a positive or negative impact on our business 

the majority of our professionals are offshore companies that outsource services to organizations operating in other countries remains a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues the united states congress periodically proposes legislation that could impose restrictions on offshore outsourcing and on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to customer locations both of which could adversely impact our business such legislative measures could broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and contracts and impact private industry with tax disincentives intellectual property transfer restrictions and restrictions on the use or availability of certain work visas 

some of our projects require our personnel to obtain visas to travel and work at customer sites outside of our personnel’s home countries and often in the united states our reliance on visas to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed makes us vulnerable to legislative and administrative changes in the number of visas to be issued in any particular year and other work permit laws and regulations the process to obtain the required visas and work permits can be lengthy and difficult and variations due to political forces and economic conditions in the number of permitted applications as well as application and enforcement processes may cause delays or rejections when trying to obtain visas delays in obtaining visas may result in delays in the ability of our personnel to travel to meet with and provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely basis in addition the availability of a sufficient number of visas without significant additional costs could limit our ability to provide services to our customers on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could delays in or the unavailability of visas and work permits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws compliance with these laws requires significant resources and noncompliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

we are subject to many laws and regulations that restrict our international operations including laws that prohibit activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions the us office of foreign assets control or ofac and other international bodies have imposed sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are also subject to the fcpa and antibribery and anticorruption laws in other countries all of which prohibit companies and their intermediaries from bribing government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under us and other antibribery laws 

our compliance program contains controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac and other sanctions and laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of our compliance program may be time consuming expensive and could result in the discovery of compliance issues or violations by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents including third parties we associate with or companies we acquire could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in us under certain state laws 

risks related to our industry and customers 

we generally do not have longterm commitments from our customers our customers may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts and we are not guaranteed payment for services performed under contract a loss of business or nonpayment from significant customers could materially affect our results of operations 

our ability to maintain continuing relationships with our major customers and successfully obtain payment for our services is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific customer is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our customers’ exclusive it services provider and we generally do not have longterm commitments from customers to purchase our services we may also fail to assess the creditworthiness of our customers adequately or accurately our customers’ ability to terminate engagements with or without cause and our customers’ inability or unwillingness to pay for services we performed makes our future revenues and profitability uncertain although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from customers who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our customers are typically for projects that are singular in nature therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end 

there are a number of factors relating to our customers that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate or not renew a contract or project with us or be unable to pay us including 

• financial difficulties 

• corporate restructuring or mergers and acquisitions activity 

• our inability to complete our contractual commitments and invoice and collect our contracted revenues 

• change in strategic priorities or economic conditions resulting in elimination of the impetus for the project or a reduced level of technology related spending 

• change in outsourcing strategy resulting in moving more work to the customer’s inhouse technology departments or to our competitors and 

• replacement of existing software with packaged software supported by licensors 

termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and thus compress our margins until we are able to reallocate our headcount customers that delay payment request modifications to their payment arrangements or fail to meet their payment obligations to us could increase our cash collection time cause us to incur bad debt expense or cause us to incur expenses in collections actions the loss of any of our major customers a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or price they are willing or able to pay us if not replaced by new service engagements and revenues could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our customers are concentrated in five specific industry verticals financial services software  hitech business information  media travel  consumer and life sciences  healthcare our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from customers in these five industry verticals and other industries that we target or may target in the future and also depends on trends in these industries to outsource the type of services we provide 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations other developments in the industries in which we operate may increase the demand for lower cost or lower quality it services and decrease the demand for our services or increase the pressure our customers put on us to reduce pricing we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes which could adversely affect our results of operations 

furthermore developments in the industries we serve could shift customer demand to new services solutions or technology if our customers demand new services solutions or technologies we may be less competitive in these new areas or may need to make significant investments to meet that demand additionally as we expand into serving new industry verticals our solutions and technology may be used by or generally affect a broader base of customers and end users which may expose us to new business and operational risks 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts and setting terms with our customers our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts assumptions and predictions about our projects the marketplace global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility and the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies larger and more complex projects that involve multiple engagements or stages heighten those pricing risks because a customer may choose not to retain us for additional stages or delay forecasted engagements which disrupts our planned project resource requirements if our pricing for a project includes dedicated personnel or facilities and the customer were to slow or stop that project we may not be able to reallocate resources to other customers our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated longterm cost savings that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract because of such inherent uncertainties we may underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts such as defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules the risk of underpricing our services or underestimating the costs of performing the work is heightened in fixedprice contracts and in contracts that require our customer to receive a productivity benefit as a result of the services performed under the contract if we fail to accurately estimate the resources time or quality levels required to complete such engagements or if the cost to us of employees facilities or technology unexpectedly increases we could be exposed to cost overruns any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of the services including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable 

our industry is sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies weaken pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology related spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our services before potential customers commit to use our services they require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our customers’ decision to select another service provider or inhouse resources to perform the services the timing of our customers’ budget cycles and customer procurement and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it could negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth in certain cases we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract which may cause fluctuations in recognizing revenues between periods or jeopardize our ability to collect payment from customers 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our customers and us our current and future customers may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential customers despite devoting significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services processes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose customers and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our products and services our ability to anticipate developments in our industry enhance our existing services develop and introduce new services provide enhancements and new features for our products and keep pace with changes and developments are critical to meeting changing customer needs developing solutions for our customers is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with anticipate or respond to changes and developments is subject to a number of risks including that 

• we may not be able to develop new or update existing services applications tools and software quickly or inexpensively enough to meet our customers’ needs 

• we may find it difficult or costly to make existing software and products work effectively and securely over the internet or with new or changed operating systems 

• we may find it challenging to develop new or update existing software services and products to keep pace with evolving industry standards methodologies technologies and regulatory developments in the industries where our customers operate at a pace and cost that is acceptable to our customers and 

• we may find it difficult to maintain high quality levels with new technologies and methodologies 

we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services products technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services products technologies or methodologies that our competitors develop may render our services or products noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and products and to develop and introduce new services and products to promptly address the needs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we cause disruptions to our customers’ businesses provide inadequate service or breach contractual obligations our customers may have claims for substantial damages against us and our reputation may be damaged our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against such claims 

if our professionals make errors in the course of delivering services or we fail to meet contractual obligations to a customer these errors or failures could disrupt the customer’s business or expose confidential or personally identifiable information any of these events could result in a reduction in our revenues damage to our reputation and could also result in a customer terminating our engagement and making claims for substantial damages against us some of our customer agreements do not limit our potential liability for occurrences such as breaches of confidentiality and intellectual property infringement indemnity and we cannot generally limit liability to third parties with which we do not have a contractual relationship in some cases breaches of confidentiality obligations including obligations to protect personally identifiable information may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief 

although we maintain professional liability insurance product liability insurance cyber incident insurance commercial general and property insurance business interruption insurance workers’ compensation coverage and umbrella insurance for certain of our operations our insurance coverage does not insure against all risks in our operations or all claims we may receive damage claims from customers or third parties brought against us or claims that we initiate due to the disruption of our business information security systems litigation or natural disasters may not be covered by our insurance may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources even if insured some types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate and we cannot insure against damage to our reputation the assertion of one or more large claims against us whether or not successful and whether or not insured could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant failure in our systems telecommunications or it infrastructure could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenues and otherwise disrupt our business 

our service model relies on maintaining active voice and data communications online resource management financial and operational record management customer service and data processing systems between our customer sites our delivery centers and our customer management locations our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these technologies which could be due to software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrades damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry government shutdowns demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control our crisis management procedures business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions particularly in the case of a catastrophic event loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete customer projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenues or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

our ability to generate and retain business could depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to customers and prospective customers based on a number of factors including reputation our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our customers’ evaluation of whether to engage our services our customers’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former customers and employees competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about us even if untrue could adversely affect our business could cause damage to our reputation and be challenging to repair could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new engagements and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark patent unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as in other countries with more developed intellectual property protections 

we require our employees and independent contractors to assign to us all intellectual property and work product they create in connection with their employment or engagement these assignment agreements also obligate our personnel to keep proprietary information confidential if these agreements are not enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or are breached we cannot ensure that we will solely own the intellectual property they create or that our proprietary information will not be disclosed our customers and certain vendors are generally obligated to keep our information confidential but if these contractual obligations are not entered or are breached or deemed unenforceable our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information may be subject to unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our customers’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable unauthorized parties to benefit from our or our customers’ technologies tools and applications without payment and may make us liable to our customers for damages and compensation which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors we have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote additional resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate knowledge of infringement or resources to enforce our trademarks if we do enforce our trademarks and our other intellectual property rights through litigation we may not be successful and the litigation may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies products and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be unaware of intellectual property rights relating to our products or services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us if those intellectual property rights are potentially relevant to our service offerings we may need to license those rights in order to continue to use the applicable technology but the holders of those intellectual property rights may be unwilling to license those rights to us on commercially acceptable terms if at all there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that if subject to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties may become unavailable to us if such third parties obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property 

we typically indemnify customers who purchase our products services and solutions against potential infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk and cost of defending the underlying infringement claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers regardless of the merits of these claims and our indemnification obligations are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages intellectual property litigation could also divert our management’s attention from our business and existing or potential customers could defer or limit their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until we resolve such litigation if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing products services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property that such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our customers may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to information security and data protection 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we collect store process transmit and view sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property proprietary business information and personally identifiable information belonging to us our customers our respective employees and other end users this information is stored in our data centers and networks or in the data centers and networks of thirdparty providers physical security and the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy some of our customers seek additional assurances for the protection of their sensitive information including personally identifiable information and attach greater liability in the event that their sensitive information is disclosed at times to achieve commercial objectives we may agree to greater liability exposure to our customers 

individuals including employees contractors and other third parties in our information security supply chain as well as groups and larger sophisticated collections of hackers such as statesponsored organizations all pose threats to our information security these individual group and organized actors have a variety of methods at their disposal including deploying malicious software exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or infrastructure using social engineering or deceptive techniques and executing coordinated attacks to compromise our services disrupt our operations or gain access to our networks and data centers 

threats to information security evolve constantly and are increasingly sophisticated and complex which makes detecting and successfully defending against them more difficult undetected vulnerabilities may persist in our network environment over long periods of time and could spread to the networks and systems of our suppliers and customers we frequently update and improve our information security environment and assess and adopt new methods devices and technologies but our policies and information security controls may not keep pace with emerging threats we have in the past been subject to cyberattacks and expect to continue to be the target of malicious attacks despite our multiple security measures any breach of our facilities network or information security defenses compromises the information stored in those locations and allows the accessed information to be held for ransom publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen such a breach misappropriation or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by these events any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under applicable laws and regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

development and deployment of measures to protect our information security or that of our customers may be inadequate and could adversely affect our results of operations 

to defend against information security threats internally at our thirdparty providers and on our customers’ systems we must continuously engineer or purchase more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve deployment and compliance with software updates assess and develop mitigation strategies and technologies to help secure information hire information security specialists and maintain a security infrastructure that protects our network products and services and the software we build for our customers we must also educate our employees contractors and customers about the need to effectively use security measures our customers particularly those in the financial services and life sciences  healthcare industry verticals may have enhanced or particular security requirements which we must address in our engineering and development services 

the cost of information security measures either to protect our information or the information of our customers could reduce our profitability actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our software and services even if those vulnerabilities are the result of hardware or software developed by third parties could harm our reputation and lead customers to use our competitors reduce or delay future purchases of our services or to seek compensation or damages 

changes in privacy and data protection regulations could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance 

epam is subject to the gdpr the substantially similar uk gdpr and the ccpa each of which imposes significant restrictions and requirements relating to the processing of personal data these and other state national and international data protection laws that are or will soon be effective are more burdensome than historical privacy standards especially in the united states the ccpa  uk gdpr and gdpr each established complex legal obligations that organizations must follow with respect to the processing of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information to third parties or to other countries and the imposition of additional notification security and other control measures 

enforcement actions taken by the european union and uk data protection authorities in the case of gdpr and uk gdpr respectively or by individuals or the california regulatory authorities in the case of the ccpa as well as audits or investigations by one or more individuals organizations or foreign government agencies could result in penalties and fines for noncompliance or direct claims against us in the event of any loss or damage as a result of a breach of these regulations the burden of compliance with additional data protection requirements may result in significant additional costs complexity and risk in our services and customers may seek to shift the potential risks resulting from the implementation of data privacy legislation to us we are required to establish processes and change certain operations in relation to the processing of personal data as a result of gdpr uk gdpr and ccpa which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of business or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect or correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current customers revenues market share or customer data a failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance and could divert development resources and increase support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our customers and us errors will not be found in the software products we develop or the services we perform any such errors could result in claims for damages against us litigation and reputational harm that could materially adversely affect our business 

general risk factors 

our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors third parties or us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors or industry by the media or investment analysts geopolitical events or uncertainty about inflation or other current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

expense related to our liabilityclassified restricted stock units which are subject to marktomarket accounting and the calculation of the weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding in accordance with the treasury method are both affected by our stock price any fluctuations in the price of our stock will affect our future operating results 

we may need additional capital and a failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and expanded revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions that we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility and we cannot be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders and additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service costs and obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

our hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with a number of counterparties as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract during an economic downturn the counterparty’s financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure in the event of a counterparty default we could incur significant losses which may harm our business and financial condition in the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate our customers and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in the geographic regions where we operate war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest manmade and natural disasters the severity and frequency of which have increased due to climate change and include famine flood fire earthquake pandemics and other regional or global health crises storm or disease may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for the services we provide and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles our crisis management procedures business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disasters particularly in the case of simultaneous or catastrophic events these events pose significant security risks to our people the facilities where they work our operations electricity and other utilities communications travel and network services and the disruption of any or all of them could materially adversely affect our financial results travel restrictions resulting from natural or manmade disruptions and political or social conflict increase the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified professionals and could unexpectedly increase our labor costs and expenses both of which could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in one or more jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including but not limited to a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our results of operations business and profitability in addition any significant changes enacted by the current us presidential administration to the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” enacted in 2017 or to regulatory guidance associated with the us tax act could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate

business update regarding military action in ukraine 

on february 24 2022 russian forces launched significant military action against ukraine and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely the impact to ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries including new and stricter sanctions by canada the united kingdom the european union the us and other companies and organizations against officials individuals regions and industries in russia ukraine and belarus and each country’s potential response to such sanctions tensions and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations any such material adverse effect from the conflict and enhanced sanctions activity may disrupt our delivery of services cause us to shift all or portions of our work occurring in the region to other countries and may restrict our ability to engage in certain projects in the region or involving certain customers in the region 

the information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our present awareness or control 

our response to the military action in ukraine 

as noted in “item 1 business – global delivery model” in part i of this annual report on form 10k ukraine is our largest delivery location by number of personnel and belarus and russia are our second and third largest delivery locations by number of personnel respectively we are actively monitoring the security of our personnel and the stability of our infrastructure including communications and internet availability we are also executing our business continuity plan and adapting to developments as they occur to protect the safety of our people and handle potential impacts to our delivery infrastructure including reallocating work to other geographies within our global footprint we are actively working with our personnel and with our customers to meet their needs and to mitigate delivery challenges 

moving forward 

we have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation as the conflict and government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control prolonged unrest military activities or broadbased sanctions should they be implemented could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business outlook we have accelerated hiring in locations outside of the region as part of our business continuity planning and in order to support client demand in addition we have implemented plans to move some of our existing personnel to other countries in order to keep them safe and mitigate impacts on our delivery of services to our customers

business update regarding covid19 

the covid19 pandemic continued its substantial and varying influence on global public health economies business operations and financial markets numerous evolving factors prevent us from accurately predicting the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to directly and indirectly impact our employees customers communities business results of operations and financial condition 

to the extent that the remainder of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” refers to a financial or performance metric that has been affected by a trend or activity that reference is in addition to any impact of the covid19 pandemic disclosed in and supplemented by this section the information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our present awareness or control 

our covid19 pandemic response 

since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic the vast majority of our employees have been able to productively and securely work from a remote location so we do not expect that covid19 will have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or productively deliver services to our customers nor on our financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures extended or expanded restrictions on travel and immigration from other countries may continue to impact our operations however we do not believe that the current travel and immigration restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

our adaptive global delivery model enables us to deliver our services and solutions to our customers from remote locations so we continue to effectively provide our customers with the products services and solutions they seek economic conditions resulting from the pandemic including supply chain disruptions persistent inflation for both goods and services and worker shortages could negatively affect our operations and the operations of our customers and their customers and could adversely impact our revenues and our results of operations 

moving forward 

we expect continued uncertainty regarding the impacts the pandemic will have on our business financial condition and results of operations we actively monitor our business and the needs of our employees customers and communities to determine the appropriate actions to take to ensure the safety of our employees and our ongoing operations our business continuity plans and adherence to the recommendations of public health authorities are intended to protect the health and safety of approximately 58000 epam professionals and the customers they serve economic and demand uncertainty in the current environment may impact our future results we continue to monitor the demand for our services and our ability to deliver them while continuing to assess how the economic effects of covid19 may impact our human capital allocation revenues operating expenses and profitability

overview of 2021 and financial highlights 

the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2021 were as follows 

• we recorded revenues of 38 billion or a 413 increase from 27 billion in the previous year positively impacted by 388 million or 14 due to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the previous year 

• income from operations grew 430 to 5423 million in 2021 from 3793 million in 2020 expressed as a percentage of revenues income from operations was 144 compared to 143 during the year ended december 31 2021 income from operations as a percentage of revenues was positively impacted by reduced facilityrelated expenses as a percentage of revenues and negatively impacted by higher levels of accrued variable compensation 

• our effective tax rate was 97 compared to 136 in the previous year the provision for income taxes was impacted primarily by the excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stockbased awards in 2021 and 2020 

• net income increased 472 to 4817 million compared to 3272 million in 2020 expressed as a percentage of revenues net income increased 05 compared to last year which was largely driven by the improvement in income from operations and a decrease in our effective tax rate 

• diluted earnings per share increased 455 to 815 for the year ended december 31 2021 from 560 in 2020 

• cash provided by operations increased 279 million or 51 to 5723 million during 2021 as compared to last year this increase was largely driven by the increase in net income as well as an increase in accrued variable compensation expense in 2021 the increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during 2021 largely attributable to the 413 growth in revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020 

the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report additional information on our policies is in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

revenues — we recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price variable consideration usually takes the form of volumebased discounts service level credits price concessions or incentives determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported 

we derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to customers by combining software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements we generate the majority of our revenues under timeandmaterial contracts which are billed using hourly daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the customer we apply a practical expedient and revenues related to timeandmaterial contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed 

fixedprice contracts include maintenance and support arrangements which may exceed one year in duration maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period fixedprice contracts also include application development arrangements where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period 

revenues from licenses which have significant standalone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer revenues from licenses which do not have standalone functionality are recognized over time if there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is one year or less 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income 

business combinations  — we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions used include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates customer attrition rates the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the useful lives for finitelived assets there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain the acquired assets typically include customer relationships software trade names noncompetition agreements and assembled workforce and as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities using monte carlo simulations which involve a simulation of future revenues and earnings during the earnout period using managements best estimates or probabilityweighted expected return methods changes in financial projections market risk assumptions discount rates or probability assumptions related to achieving the various earnout criteria would result in a change in the fair value of contingent consideration such changes if any are recorded within interest and other income net in the company’s consolidated statements of income 

if the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date revisions to the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings

revenues 

we continue to expand our presence across multiple geographies and verticals both organically and through strategic acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2021 our total revenues grew 413 over the previous year to 38 billion this growth resulted from our ability to retain existing customers and increase the level of services we provide to them and our ability to produce revenues from new customer relationships during the year ended december 31 2021 we experienced a decrease in customer concentration as compared to the previous year with revenues from our top five top ten and top twenty customer groups decreasing as a percentage of total revenues revenues have been positively impacted by our acquisitions in 2021 which contributed 43 to our revenue growth and by the fluctuations in foreign currencies which increased our revenue growth by 14 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the previous year 

we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical customer location service arrangement type and customer concentration 

revenues by vertical 

we assign our customers into one of our five main vertical markets or a group of various industries where we are increasing our presence which we label as “emerging verticals” including energy utilities manufacturing automotive telecommunications and several others 

the following table presents our revenues by vertical and revenues as a percentage of total revenues by vertical for the periods indicated

revenues by customer location 

our revenues are sourced from multiple countries which we assign into four geographic markets and identify as americas emea cee and apac we present and discuss our revenues by customer location based on the location of the specific customer site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the customer or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed revenues by customer location is different from revenues by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report segments are not based on the geographic location of the customers but instead they are based on the location of the company’s management responsible for a particular customer or market 

the following table sets forth revenues by customer location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 





1 americas includes revenues from customers in north central and south america 

2 emea includes revenues from customers in western europe and the middle east 

3 cee includes revenues from customers in russia belarus kazakhstan ukraine and georgia 

4 apac or asia pacific includes revenues from customers in east asia southeast asia and australia 

during the year ended december 31 2021 revenues in the americas our largest geography were 22268 million growing 6317 million or 396 from 15951 million reported for the year ended december 31 2020 revenues from this geography accounted for 593 of total revenues in 2021 a decrease from 600 in the prior year the united states continued to be our largest customer location contributing revenues of 21253 million in 2021 compared to 15237 million in 2020 

revenues in our emea geography were 12597 million an increase of 3799 million or 432 over 8798 million in the previous year revenues in this geography accounted for 334 of consolidated revenues in 2021 as compared to 331 in the previous year the top three revenue contributing customer location countries in emea were the united kingdom switzerland and the netherlands generating revenues of 4749 million 2712 million and 1548 million in 2021 respectively compared to 3312 million 2034 million and 1147 million in 2020 respectively fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the us dollar particularly the euro and the british pound during 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year positively impacted revenue growth in the emea geography by 33 

during 2021 revenues in our cee geography increased 533 million or 465 from the previous year the increase in cee revenues came primarily from customers in russia contributing 503 million of revenue growth in 2021 compared to the previous year 

revenues from customers in locations in our apac region comprised 28 of total revenues in 2021 a level consistent with the prior year

revenues by customer concentration 

we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers and we seek to grow revenues from our existing customers by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon beginning or completion of multiyear projects we believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing customers in addition we remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more customers to our client mix through organic growth and strategic acquisitions and over the longterm we expect revenue concentration from our top customers to decrease 

the following table presents revenues contributed by our customers by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 



the following table shows the number of customers grouped by revenues recognized by the company for each year presented 



revenues by service offering 

our service arrangements have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our customers where we combine software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services we are continually expanding our service capabilities moving beyond traditional services into business consulting design and physical product development 

the following table shows revenues by service offering as an amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the years indicated 



see note 11 “revenues” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our contract types and related revenue recognition policies 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation projectrelated travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to customer projects salaries and other compensation expenses of our delivery professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing customer services during a given period our employees are a critical asset necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs 

we manage the utilization levels of our delivery professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects some of these professionals are hired and trained to work for specific customers or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific customers or projects our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services 

during the year ended december 31 2021 cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 24837 million representing an increase of 434 from 17325 million reported last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 289 growth in the average number of production headcount for the year and a higher level of accrued variable compensation in 2021 as compared to the previous year 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 661 and 651 during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the yearoveryear increase is primarily due to a 17 increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense as a percentage of revenues largely driven by a higher level of accrued variable compensation during 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 partially offset by decreases in travel and entertainment expenses 

discussion of cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization from 2020 as compared to 2019 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business these expenses include the costs of salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation severance bad debt travel legal and accounting services insurance facilities including operating leases advertising and other promotional activities 

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased due to our continuously expanding operations strategic business acquisitions and the hiring of necessary personnel to support our growth during the year ended december 31 2021 selling general and administrative expenses were 6487 million representing an increase of 338 as compared to 4848 million reported last year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2021 was primarily due to a 1368 million increase in personnelrelated costs which include stockbased compensation expense primarily driven by an increase in headcount 

expressed as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses decreased 09 to 173 for the year ended december 31 2021 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 12 decrease in facilityrelated expenses as a percentage of revenues partially offset by increases in talent acquisition and development expenses and travel and entertainment expenses as a percentage of revenues 

discussion of selling general and administrative expenses from 2020 as compared to 2019 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

depreciation and amortization expense 

depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of physical assets used in the operation of our business such as computer equipment software buildings we purchased leasehold improvements as well as various office furniture and equipment depreciation and amortization expense also includes amortization of acquired finitelived intangible assets 

during the year ended december 31 2021 depreciation and amortization expense was 834 million representing an increase of 205 million from 629 million reported last year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily driven by an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth and amortization of acquired finitelived intangible assets which contributed 53 million to the year over year increase in depreciation and amortization expense expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 22 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 24 in 2020 

discussion of depreciation and amortization expense from 2020 as compared to 2019 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

interest and other lossincome net 

interest and other lossincome net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and employee loans gains and losses from certain financial instruments interest expense related to our borrowings and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration interest and other lossincome net decreased from a gain of 38 million during the year ended december 31 2020 to a loss of 17 million during the year ended december 31 2021 which is primarily attributable to a 70 million increase in the charge from the change in fair value of contingent consideration reflecting improved expectations for the performance of certain acquisitions partially offset by higher government grant income in 2021 there were no material changes in interest and other income net in 2020 as compared to 2019 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment we consider factors that may contribute favorably or unfavorably to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future these factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items 

as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2021 2020 and 2019 we had 4049 million 2781 million and 2342 million respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest and penalty expense tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

the provision for income taxes was 517 million in 2021 and 513 million in 2020 the increase was primarily driven by the increase in pretax income year over year partially offset by a significant increase in excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stockbased awards which were 716 million in 2021 compared to 366 million in 2020 the effective tax rate decreased from 136 in 2020 to 97 in 2021 primarily due to the increase in excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stockbased awards and tax benefits of certain onetime tax credits recorded in 2021 

discussion of the provision for income taxes from 2020 as compared to 2019 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020

results by business segment 

our operations consist of three reportable segments north america europe and russia the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and segment operating profits segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses certain corporate expenses are not allocated to specific segments as these expenses are not controllable at the segment level such expenses include certain types of professional fees certain taxes included in operating expenses compensation to nonemployee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses including compensation of specific groups of nonproduction employees in addition the company does not allocate stockbased compensation amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations goodwill and other asset impairment charges acquisitionrelated costs and certain other onetime charges these unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations 

we manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for the client base and market as managerial responsibility for a particular customer relationship generally correlates with the customer’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between customer locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some cases managerial responsibility for a particular customer is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between customer executives and particular members of epam’s senior management team in such cases the customer’s activity would be reported through the respective management team member’s reportable segment our europe segment includes our business in the apac region which is managed by the same management team 

segment revenues from external customers and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe and russia segments for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



north america segment 

during 2021 north america segment revenues increased 6404 million or 400 over last year revenues from our north america segment represented 597 of total segment revenues a decrease from 602 reported in the corresponding period of 2020 during 2021 as compared to 2020 north america segment operating profits increased 1176 million or 341 to 4628 million expressed as a percentage of revenue north america segment operating profit decreased to 206 in 2021 as compared to 216 in 2020 this decrease is primarily attributable to increases in personnelrelated costs largely driven by a higher level of accrued variable compensation 

the following table presents north america segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 



software  hitech remained the largest industry vertical in the north america segment during the year ended december 31 2021 growing 333 as compared to the prior year which was a result of the continued focus on working with our technology customers during the year ended december 31 2021 r evenues from the business information  media vertical experienced growth of 166 and largely benefited from expansion of services to several of our existing top 10 customers financial services grew 812 in 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to growth in a wealth management customer that was previously one of our top 200 customers and is now one of our top 30 customers for the year emerging verticals experienced 395 growth during 2021 compared to the prior year largely due to an increase in services provided to a customer in the automotive industry 

europe segment 

during 2021 europe segment revenues were 13505 million reflecting an increase of 4032 million or 426 from last year revenues were positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2021 had our europe segment revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2020 we would have reported revenue growth of 393 revenues from our europe segment represent 359 and 356 of total segment revenues during 2021 and 2020 respectively during 2021 this segment’s operating profits increased 808 million or 529 as compared to last year to 2337 million europe’s operating profit represented 173 of europe segment revenues as compared to 161 in 2020 europe segment operating profit was positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates predominantly the euro and british pound as well as the recognition of 65 million in revenues from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods partially offset by a higher level of accrued variable compensation during the year ended december 31 2020 segment operating profit was negatively impacted by temporary discounts provided to certain customers experiencing challenging economic conditions due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the following table presents europe segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 



financial services remained the largest industry vertical in the europe segment during the year ended december 31 2021 the europe segment benefited from 606 growth in travel  consumer during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to strong demand from several retail customers and recovery in demand from certain customers in the travel industry for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 business information  media vertical experienced slower relative growth at several clients where revenues from certain engagements plateaued compared to the prior year revenues in software  hitech increased during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the expansion of services provided to one of our top 20 customers and revenues from companies acquired during 2021 

russia segment 

during 2021 revenues from our russia segment increased 551 million relative to 2020 and represent 44 of total segment revenues during 2021 compared with 42 in 2020 operating profits of our russia segment increased 267 million as compared to 2020 expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues the segment’s operating profits were 197 and 53 in 2021 and 2020 respectively this increase is attributable to a net benefit in 2021 as compared to the corresponding period of last year from revenues from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods and a benefit from the change in the valuation of the russian ruble relative to the us dollar 

the following table presents russia segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 



revenues in the russia segment are generally subject to fluctuations and are impacted by the timing of revenue recognition associated with the execution of contracts and the foreign currency exchange rate of the russian ruble to the us dollar revenues in the financial services vertical primarily benefited from increased revenues from customers in the banking and insurance sector during 2021 as compared to 2020 revenues in the travel  consumer vertical benefited in 2021 from increased revenues from a single retailer there have been no significant changes in the other individual verticals during 2021 as compared to 2020 

currency fluctuations of the russian ruble typically impact the results in the russia segment ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and the volatility of the russian ruble can significantly impact reported revenues and profitability in this segment we continue to monitor geopolitical forces economic and trade sanctions and other issues involving this region 

discussion of segment results from 2020 as compared to 2019 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

effects of inflation 

economies in some countries where we operate have periodically experienced high rates of inflation periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business as of december 31 2021 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 14466 million as well as 6750 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility see note 9 “debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the terms of our revolving credit facility and information about debt 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2021 increased 279 million or 51 to 5723 million as compared to 2020 primarily driven by the increase in net income as well as an increase in accrued variable compensation expense in 2021 the increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during 2021 largely attributable to the 413 growth in revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2021 was 3689 million compared to 1672 million used in the same period in 2020 the cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to 3150 million used during 2021 for the acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired compared to 189 million used for the acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired during 2020 cash used for capital expenditures was 1115 million in 2021 compared to cash used for capital expenditures of 688 million during the comparable period in 2020 additionally net cash used in investing activities was positively impacted by the maturity of 600 million of time deposits during 2021 and negatively impacted by the 600 million use of cash to purchase these time deposits during 2020 furthermore 25 million was used for purchases of nonmarketable securities during 2021 compared to 205 million used in 2020 

financing activities 

during the year ended december 31 2021 net cash used in financing activities was 596 million compared to 08 million net cash used in financing activities in 2020 during 2021 we received cash from the exercises of stock options issued under our longterm incentive plans of 263 million compared to 264 million received in the corresponding period of 2020 these cash inflows were offset by cash used for the payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units of 416 million in 2021 compared to 201 million paid in 2020 additionally the year ended december 31 2021 included payments of 402 million attributable to the acquisitiondate fair value of contingent consideration compared to payments of 70 million attributable to acquisitiondate fair value of contingent consideration during the year ended december 31 2020 

discussion of the comparison of the cash flows between 2020 and 2019 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future however our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors including the impact of the covid19 pandemic as described elsewhere in this mda to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

borrowings 

see note 8 “leases” and note 9 “debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 15 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks primarily result from changes in concentration of credit risks interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in addition our operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and trade receivables 

we maintain our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 

we have cash in countries where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured as of december 31 2021 we had 2326 million of cash and cash equivalents in banks in russia belarus and ukraine representing 161 our total cash and cash equivalents we place our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions considered stable in the region limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold the company’s funds or sanctions may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect the company’s ability to complete banking transactions which could adversely affect our business and financial condition cash in these countries is used for the operational needs of the local entities and cash balances change with the expected operating needs of these entities we regularly monitor cash held in these countries and to the extent the cash held exceeds amounts required to support our operations in these countries the company distributes the excess funds into markets with more developed banking sectors 

trade receivables are generally dispersed across many customers operating in different industries therefore concentration of credit risk is limited and we do not believe significant credit risks existed at december 31 2021 though our results of operations depend on our ability to successfully collect payment from our customers for work performed historically credit losses and writeoffs of trade receivables have not been material to our consolidated financial statements if any of our customers enter bankruptcy protection or otherwise take steps to alleviate their financial distress including distress resulting from the covid19 pandemic our credit losses and writeoffs of trade receivables could increase which would negatively impact our results of operations 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is influenced by the changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalent deposits shortterm investments and paid on any outstanding balance on our borrowings mainly under our 2021 credit facility which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the currency and timing of funds borrowed we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to these deposits investments and borrowings 

foreign exchange risk 

our global operations are conducted predominantly in us dollars other than us dollars the company generates revenues in various currencies principally euros british pounds russian rubles swiss francs and canadian dollars and incurs expenditures principally in russian rubles polish zlotys euros swiss francs hungarian forints british pounds indian rupees chinese yuan renminbi and mexican pesos as a result currency fluctuations specifically the depreciation of the euro british pound and canadian dollar and the appreciation of the russian ruble hungarian forint polish zloty indian rupee and chinese yuan renminbi relative to the us dollar could negatively impact our results of operations 

during the year ended december 31 2021 our foreign exchange loss was 72 million compared to a 47 million loss reported last year during the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 348 of consolidated revenues and 456 of operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated operating expenses in the normal course of business we implemented a hedging program through which we enter into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts with durations of twelve months or less that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted russian ruble polish zloty hungarian forint and indian rupee transactions as of december 31 2021 the net unrealized loss from these hedges was 44 million 

management supplements results reported in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles referred to as gaap with nongaap financial measures management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating its performance when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared on the basis of “constant currency” which is a nongaap financial measure this measure excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we reported revenue growth of 413 over the prior year had our consolidated revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2020 we would have reported revenue growth of 399 during 2021 our revenues benefited from appreciation of the euro british pound russian ruble and canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2021 we reported net income growth of 472 over the previous year had our consolidated results been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2020 we would have reported net income growth of 412 net income was most positively impacted by appreciation of the euro and british pound relative to the us dollar and partially offset by the negative impact from the appreciation of the russian ruble relative to the us dollar

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting except as described below 

during the year ended december 31 2021 the company made certain business acquisitions as described more fully in note 2 “acquisitions” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k as permitted by the securities and exchange commission management has elected to exclude these acquired entities from its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 the company began to integrate these acquired companies into its internal control over financial reporting structure subsequent to their respective acquisition dates and expects to complete these integrations in 2022 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management has excluded certain business acquisitions from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 since these entities were acquired in business combinations in 2021 these businesses are included in our 2021 consolidated financial statements and constituted 151 of total assets as of december 31 2021 and 30 of revenues for the year then ended 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in “part iv item 15 exhibits financial statement schedule” of this annual report on form 10k 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

global delivery model 

we believe the development of a robust global delivery model creates a key competitive advantage enabling us to better understand and meet our customers’ diverse needs and to provide a compelling value proposition we continuously grow our delivery platform both organically and through strategically acquired locations and personnel with diversified skills that support our strategy we had 36737 delivery personnel as of december 31 2020 which mainly includes our core information technology professionals as well as designers consultants and scientists 

we serve our customers through onsite offsite and offshore locations across the world and use strategically located delivery centers to offer a strong diversified and costeffective delivery platform our largest delivery centers are located in belarus ukraine and russia and our delivery model has not been materially affected by the political and economic uncertainty in these locations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 9638 delivery professionals located in belarus the majority of these delivery professionals are located in minsk the capital of belarus which is wellpositioned to serve as a prime it outsourcing destination given its strong industrial base and established educational infrastructure furthermore the government in belarus encourages investment in this sector through various longterm tax incentives 

our locations in ukraine and russia offer many of the same benefits as belarus including educational infrastructure availability of qualified software engineers and government support of the technology industry as of december 31 2020 we had 9115 delivery professionals in ukraine and 6348 delivery professionals in russia 

our other significant locations with delivery professionals are the united states with 2292 india with 2052 poland with 1721 hungary with 1534 mexico with 607 and china with 534 as of december 31 2020 

human capital 

our more than 41000 employees are a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and serve our customers therefore our ability to identify attract hire and retain people who are highly skilled in information technology as delivery professionals as well as individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive finance legal human resources and other key management positions is critical to our success we believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our customers and investors to attract retain and motivate our employees we offer a challenging work environment a culture that values the individual ongoing skills development initiatives attractive career advancement with continuous rotation and promotion opportunities while providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we had a total of 41168 36739 and 30156 employees respectively of these employees as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 36737 32561 and 26760 of those employees were delivery professionals 

health safety and wellness we invest in programs designed to improve the physical mental and social wellbeing of our employees so we can offer a safe welcoming and productive workplace our health and safety programs are designed to comply with the regulations and address the conditions in the multiple jurisdictions where we have people and facilities and further designed to be compatible with the working necessities of our delivery and administrative operations in response to the covid19 pandemic we implemented significant changes that were consistent with public health guidance and were in the best interest of our employees our customers and the communities where we work and live our primary changes were to ask the vast majority of our employees to work from home to implement additional safety measures at our offices and delivery centers and to develop new technologies for employees who were required to report to work in our or our customers’ facilities 

recognizing that the abrupt changes associated with the covid19 pandemic and remote working had the potential to significantly disrupt the worklife balance and wellness of our employees we increased awareness of existing programs that focus on enhancing our employees’ mental wellbeing we also developed new programs such as a parenting resource group where peers could share tips resources and ideas to support each other while schools and child and elder care facilities were closed and broadcast live town hallstyle forums where our senior leadership could listen to and quickly address employees’ questions and concerns 

recruitment training and utilization as an innovationdriven business in a competitive industry our success depends on hiring the most talented employees in the industry and effectively training and deploying them using utilization practices and technologies to satisfy the demands of our customers we actively monitor our utilization rates to balance the needs of our customers the availability location and skill sets of our employees and the need for our employees to engage in diverse and challenging work we have dedicated fulltime employees who oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including talent acquisition teams whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced professionals around the world we manage utilization through strategic hiring and efficiently staffing projects for our customers at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the full year utilization rates of our delivery professionals were approximately 798 780 and 781  respectively we are continuously exploring new geographies and markets as sources of talent 

epam invests significant resources in training and developing our employees through our learning and development programs our largest learning and development investment has been directed towards developing our engineering talent including targeted training programs innovation labs and significant internal production projects our employees consumed over 16 million learning hours in 2020 we deliver learning opportunities and content through our unique learning ecosystem that promotes learning in the daily workflow to improve retention and productivity and through dedicated events including our weeklong global learning event which featured approximately 200 online sessions we have also built relationships with laboratories and technical universities so our employees can be exposed to the current thinking in academia we regularly host or participate in “hackathons” so our employees can build technical skills and foster communities around specific technologies and areas of interest 

we deliver learning and development content through proprietary platforms that make learning and development content easily available to all of our employees our digital learning platform provides our employees with an interface to meet our employees’ learning and training needs and includes a recommendation engine that suggests courses and materials based on employee role level location and skills our electronic library platform makes books and publications available to all of our employees and we celebrate learning achievements through our recognition portal where we promote our employees’ learning accomplishments and employees can recognize each other for their teamwork initiative and unique valuable skills 

diversity and inclusion epam provides our customers with the skills of our talented personnel which includes people with varied and diverse backgrounds and characteristics to drive innovation and thought diversity in delivering our services we believe that innovation comes from the unique perspectives knowledge and experiences of our global employees so we strive to create an inclusive culture by offering comprehensive language learning programs and providing structured education in communication skills and cultural sensitivity and awareness 

increasing diversity in executive and key operational leadership roles is an organizational priority that starts at the top of our organization for example women currently represent approximately 29 of the independent directors on our board we have developed programs both within epam and externally so we can continuously retain and supply a pipeline of qualified diverse candidates to foster our goals our programs include dedicating resources and personnel in our talent acquisition team to identify recognize and use diverse and inclusive sources for hiring including associating with organizations that are focused on promoting underrepresented groups in engineering it and business we also developed the emerging engineers lab an internship program for entrylevel talent sourced from a variety of diverse technology programs across the us participants who successfully complete the paid training program are ready to engage on billable customer engagements with the rest of our delivery professionals we also supplemented our mandatory annual training with materials geared towards eliminating unconscious bias in our professional interactions 

our employees have driven the creation of discussion forums focused on diversity and inclusion topics important to them and organized participation in global and local events including international women’s day and pride celebrations recognizing that improving the number of underrepresented people in the software and technology industries starts with access to science technology engineering and mathematics “stem” education epam has associated with technical universities in our largest employee population geographies to bolster postsecondary stem education we also created the epam ekids program where our employees volunteer their time to teach elementary school age children of any gender race or ethnic identity stem concepts and introductory software coding skills as of the end of 2020 we offered the epam ekids program in 13 countries 

employee engagement and retention we are committed to respecting our employees fundamental human rights at work and accordingly are a participant in the united nations global compact we believe that retaining skilled talent requires substantially more than meeting basic employment and labor rights and that employees who are fairly compensated feel supported in their career development and are engaged with their employer are more likely to remain with that employer that is why we strive to provide pay and benefits that demonstrate the value of our employees to us including a competitive salary flexible worklife balance paid time off health coverage ongoing training programs relocation options and recognition opportunities for open source software contributions 

we believe that the career development programs we offer both attract new talent and help retain existing employees 

our career development programs create detailed and progressive training plans for our employees and help them choose from internal and external training options mentoring programs and handson opportunities to experience emerging technology areas these programs are housed in proprietary platforms that provide our employees with a framework for the skill development they will need to build their career path identify skill gaps and set professional development goals we designed our career development programs to enable our employees to develop the best engineering practices and influence engineering culture develop thought leadership in technical and strategic skills and introduce them to leaders in the field at our industry conferences our career development programs also give our employees opportunities to earn accreditation and relevant expertise in various technology fields including software and project management certifications and recognition and credentialing from the industry’s primary software and cloud services providers 

epam focuses on retaining and engaging top talent by focusing on hiring people with the skill sets our customers need and who also fit our values so we can build longterm employee satisfaction we endeavor to recruit for careers not for shortterm projects and actively foster feedback from our employees so we can improve the epam employee experience identify opportunities to strengthen our culture and improve retention and help our people develop their careers we believe our ability to effectively hire engage and retain highskilled personnel is a principal competitive factor in our business which is evidenced by our 2020 voluntary attrition rate of 108 which decreased compared to our 2019 and 2018 voluntary attrition rate of 133  and 148  respectively moreover our employees have demonstrated their satisfaction with our approach by giving their highest ratings in our 2020 annual employee survey to the following areas trust in management 934100 good working environment 930100 cooperation between teams 898100 and employee contribution to epam’s success 896100 receiving and responding to employee feedback plays a critical role in engaging and retaining our employees because it offers us an opportunity to improve our operations and for our employees to continually enhance their skills 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our services through our senior management sales and business development teams account managers and professional staff our client service professionals and account managers who maintain direct customer relationships play an integral role in engaging with current customers to identify and pursue potential business opportunities this strategy has been effective in promoting repeat business and growth from within our existing customer base and we believe that our reputation as a reliable provider of software engineering solutions drives additional business from inbound requests and referrals in addition to effective client management our sales model also utilizes an integrated sales and marketing approach that leverages a dedicated sales team to identify and acquire new accounts 

we maintain a marketing team which coordinates corporatelevel branding efforts such as participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events as well as sponsorship of programming competitions we have been recognized by many top global independent research agencies such as forrester gartner zinnov and hfs and by publications such as forbes and fortune 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as eastern europe india and china we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings a reputation for and a track record of highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to customers’ business needs scale financial stability and price 

we face competition from various technology services providers such as accenture atos capgemini cognizant technology solutions deloitte digital dxc technology exlservice genpact globallogic globant hcl technologies hp enterprise ibm services infosys mindtree perficient tata consultancy services virtusa corporation and wipro among others additionally we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate 

we believe that our focus on complex and innovative software product development solutions our technical employee base and our development and continuous improvement in process methodologies applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future 

quality management and information security 

we are continuously investing in applications tools and infrastructure to manage all aspects of our global delivery process in order to manage quality and security risks while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our customers we maintain processes and infrastructure to protect our customers’ and their customers’ confidential and sensitive information and allocate resources to ensure information security cybersecurity and data privacy we have made significant investments in the appropriate people processes and technology to establish and manage compliance with confidentiality policies laws and regulations governing our activities such as the european union data protection legal framework referred to as the general data protection regulation “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” and others

we have developed sophisticated project management techniques facilitated through our proprietary project management tools a webbased collaborative environment for software development which we consider critical for visibility into project deliverables resource management team messaging and projectrelated documents these tools promote collaboration and effective oversight reduce work time and costs and increase quality for our it management and our customers 

corporate and social responsibility 

we are committed to integrating positive social environmental and ethical practices into our business operations and strategy this commitment is key to our continual development as a business and drives value for our employees customers business partners the community and other stakeholders we practice the principles established in our code of ethical conduct by making positive contributions to the communities in which we operate and championing corporate social responsibility efforts 

through our focused efforts in the areas of education environment and community we are committed to sharing the expertise and attributes of our highly skilled global workforce to effectively support the needs of and positively add to the world at large and the communities where we work and live by understanding our impact on local regional and global communities we strive to create positive change and opportunities in areas where it is needed most such efforts include our global technology education initiatives through which we provide innovative industryrelevant technology training and mentorship programs to students globally as well as through other technology conferences seminars and hackathon events where we encourage social innovation and jumpstart collaboration among our local tech communities we maintain strong relationships with the leading technical institutions in eastern europe and we support these universities through epambranded research labs developing training courses and curriculum providing teaching equipment and engaging students to identify their talents in information technology 

we believe responsible stewardship of the environment is critical and we take this responsibility seriously we continually strive to improve our environmental performance through implementation of sustainable development and environmental practices including recycling and upcycling electronics and computers and designing and releasing a carbon footprint calculator to our employees and the general public in addition as an innovationdriven business epam’s success depends on hiring the most talented employees in the industry we are committed to respecting our employees fundamental human rights at work we similarly expect our suppliers vendors and subcontractors and all other thirdparty companies that comprise epam’s supply chain to respect human rights and to avoid complicity in human rights abuses and have adopted a code of conduct for our suppliers and vendors accordingly 

intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our customers we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us which assign to us all deliverable intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or provision of services these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential 

we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our customers these customary agreements cover our use of our customers’ software systems and platforms as our customers usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them furthermore we often grant a nonexclusive license to our customers to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary to use the software or systems we develop for them 

regulations 

due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations several foreign and us federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business see “item 1a risk factors — risks related to regulation and legislation” we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and similar anticorruption laws and data privacy regulations compliance with these laws requires significant resources and noncompliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock listed below not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence are the most significant risk factors applicable to us additionally forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “forwardlooking statements” 

risks related to covid19 

our results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility in the price of our common stock uncertainty in customer demand for our services and widespread economic disruption the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will further impact our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous factors that are frequently changing or unknown and that we may not be able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals’ responses or planned responses to the pandemic including availability and administration rates of vaccines the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and any interventions or government relief or stimulus intended to mitigate decreased economic activity the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products services and solutions our ability to sell and provide our products services and solutions including as a result of travel restrictions personnel working from home or with diminished technology and communication abilities and social distancing the ability of our customers to pay timely if at all for our services and solutions with or without discounts requested by our customers bankruptcy or other insolvency procedures among our customers and closures of our and our customers’ offices and facilities the closure of our customers’ facilities restrictions that prevent our customers from accessing those facilities or their own customers and broad disruptions in our customers’ markets and customer base has disrupted and could continue to disrupt the demand for our products services and solutions and result in among other things termination of customer contracts delays or interruptions in the performance of contracts losses of revenues and an increase in bad debt expense customers may also slow or halt decision making delay planned work or suspend terminate fail to renew or reduce existing contracts or services travel and immigration restrictions may delay or prevent our personnel from accessing worksites and workfromhome or remote working arrangements could reduce profitability or increase information security cyber security and connectivity vulnerabilities in addition when covid19related restrictions on businesses and consumers are eased our ability to deliver services to our customers could be affected by any outbreak of illness among employees returning to our facilities or to our customers’ facilities moreover there may be additional costs that we will have to incur in connection with further changes to or a return to normal operating conditions to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section of this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 including but not limited to those relating to our operations in emerging markets our ability to execute on our growth strategy through strategic acquisitions our dependency on third parties for network infrastructure attracting hiring and retaining personnel the effects on movements in foreign currency exchange rates and the effects that changes to fiscal political regulatory and other federal policies may have on epam each of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor stock price 

risks related to our personnel and growth 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management systems resources and results of operations 

we have grown rapidly and significantly expanded our business over the past several years both organically and through strategic acquisitions our growth has resulted in part from managing larger and more complex projects for our customers but consequently requires that we invest substantial amounts of cash in human capital and the infrastructure to support them including training administration and facilities our rapid growth places significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure and creates challenges including 

• recruiting training and retaining sufficiently skilled professionals and management personnel 

• planning resource utilization rates on a consistent basis and efficiently using onsite offsite and offshore staffing 

• maintaining close and effective relationships with a larger number of customers in a greater number of industries and locations 

• controlling costs and minimizing cost overruns and project delays in delivery center and infrastructure expansion 

• effectively maintaining productivity levels and implementing process improvements across geographies and business units and 

• improving our internal administrative operational and financial infrastructure 

we intend to continue our expansion and pursue available opportunities for the foreseeable future as we introduce new services enter into new markets and take on increasingly large and complex projects our business may face new risks and challenges if customers do not choose us for large and complex projects or we do not effectively manage those projects our reputation business and financial goals may be damaged we need to generate business and revenues to support new investments and infrastructure projects if the challenges associated with expansion negatively impact our anticipated growth and margins our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we must successfully attract hire train and retain qualified personnel to service our customers’ projects and we must productively utilize those personnel to remain profitable 

identifying recruiting hiring and retaining professionals with diverse skill sets across our broad geography of operations is critical to maintaining existing engagements and obtaining new business if we are unable to recruit skilled professionals and if we do not deploy those professionals and use computers and other fixedcost resources productively our profitability will be significantly impacted we must manage the utilization levels of the professionals that we hire and train by planning for future needs effectively and staffing projects appropriately while accurately predicting the general economy and our customers’ need for our services if we are unable to attract hire train and retain highly skilled personnel and productively deploy them on customer projects we will jeopardize our ability to meet our customers’ expectations and develop ongoing and future business which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

competition for highly skilled professionals is intense in the markets where we operate and we may experience significant employee turnover rates due to such competition if we are unable to retain professionals with specialized skills our revenues operating efficiency and profitability will decrease cost reductions such as reducing headcount or voluntary departures that result from our failure to retain the professionals we hire could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire personnel to meet our business requirements price increases resulting from increasing compensation to retain personnel could lead to a decline in demand for our services 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of some of our personnel or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

in several countries certain of our personnel are retained as independent contractors the criteria to determine whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary by jurisdiction as can the interpretation of the applicable laws if a government authority changes the applicable laws or a court makes any adverse determination with respect to independent contractors in general or one or more of our independent contractors specifically we could incur significant costs including for prior periods for tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and increase the difficulty in attracting and retaining personnel 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions we may not be able to replace them easily or at all if any of our senior executives or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose customers suppliers knowhow and other key personnel to those competitors if we are unable to attract new senior executives or key personnel due to the intense competition for talent in our industry it could disrupt our business operations and growth 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if acquisitions do not perform to our expectations our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

strategic acquisitions are part of our expansion strategy but these transactions involve significant risks acquired companies may not advance our business strategy or achieve a satisfactory return on our investment we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired employees and business culture customer relationships or operations and acquisitions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business furthermore contracts between our acquisition targets and their customers may lack terms and conditions that adequately protect us against the risks associated with the services we provide which may increase our potential exposure to damages if not effectively managed the disruption of our ongoing business increases in our expenses including significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and difficulty and complexity of effectively integrating acquired operations may adversely affect our overall growth and profitability 

risks related to our operations 

instability in geographies where we have significant operations and personnel or where we derive substantial amounts of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business customers service delivery and financial results 

several countries in which we operate are experiencing or may continue to experience civil and political unrest more than half of our revenues come from customers located in north america particularly the united states and we have significant operations in the emerging market economies of eastern europe we had almost 220 employees in armenia as of december 31 2020 and more than half of our global delivery administrative and support personnel are located in ukraine russia and belarus 

in the united states political and civil discord the election of a new presidential administration and popular and regulatory scrutiny of the technology companies that form a part of our customer base have resulted in a period of social instability and potentially lasting change in the technology industry belarus has experienced numerous and continued public protest activities and civil unrest since the presidential election in early august 2020 with active government and policeforce intervention the extent and duration of the instability in belarus remains uncertain russia has also experienced similar public protest activities and civil unrest related to political matters with uncertain extent and duration continuing armed conflict in parts of eastern ukraine and weak economic conditions that deteriorated because of the covid19 pandemic have fueled ongoing economic uncertainty in ukraine and armenia and azerbaijan recently agreed to a ceasefire after a longterm conflict erupted into open military engagement between the two countries in october 2020 our personnel are not located in the volatile regions of eastern ukraine or armenia however economic civil and political uncertainty exists and may continue in many of the regions where we operate and derive our revenue international responses including european union and us sanctions against officials individuals regions and industries in belarus ukraine and russia prolonged political and civil instability in the us and each country’s potential response to such sanctions and tensions could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

epam is actively monitoring and enhancing the security of our people and the stability of our infrastructure and the general infrastructure in the countries where we operate and responding to outages in communications and internet availability according to our multilayer business continuity plans to date we have not experienced any significant interruptions in our infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our customers we have developed and in some cases implemented additional contingency plans to relocate work andor personnel to other locations and add new locations as appropriate our business continuity plans are designed to address known contingency scenarios to ensure that we have adequate processes and practices in place to protect the safety of our people and to handle potential impacts to our delivery capabilities our crisis management procedures business continuity plans and disaster recovery capabilities may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of prolonged or multiple crises such as civil unrest military conflict and a pandemic in a concentrated geographic area the current events in the regions where we operate and where we derive a significant amount of our business may pose security risks to our people our facilities our operations and infrastructure such as utilities and network services and the disruption of any or all of them could materially adversely affect our operations andor financial results whether in these countries or in others in which we operate civil unrest political instability or uncertainty military activities or broadbased sanctions should they continue for the long term or escalate could require us to rebalance our geographic concentrations and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

increases in wages equity compensation and other compensation expenses could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage increase our costs and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wages for technology professionals in the emerging markets where we have significant operations and delivery centers are lower than comparable wages in more developed countries however wages in the technology industry in these countries may increase at a faster rate than in the past which may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our people if we increase operations and hiring in more developed economies our compensation expenses will increase because of the higher wages demanded by technology professionals in those markets wage inflation whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary course pay increases may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability if we are not able to pass those costs on to our customers or charge premium prices when justified by market demand 

we expect to continue our practice of granting equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and paying other stockbased compensation the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may make issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plans less attractive to us but if we reduce the amount or value of equity award grants we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel conversely if we grant more or higher value equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the equity compensation expenses could materially adversely affect our results of operations new regulations volatility in our stock and dilution to our stockholders could diminish our use and the value of our equitybased awards this could put us at a competitive disadvantage or cause us to reconsider our compensation practices 

our operations in emerging markets subject us to greater economic financial and banking risks than we would face in more developed markets 

our significant operations in emerging market economies in eastern europe india and certain other asian countries are vulnerable to market and economic volatility to a greater extent than more developed markets which presents risks to our business and operations a majority of our revenues are generated in north america and western europe however most of our personnel and delivery centers are located in lower cost locations including emerging markets this exposes us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues compensation purchases capital expenditures receivables and other balancesheet items as we continue to leverage and expand our global delivery model into other emerging markets a larger portion of our revenues and incurred expenses may be in currencies other than us dollars currency exchange volatility caused by economic instability or other factors could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

the economies of certain emerging market countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns we have cash in banks in countries such as belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan georgia armenia and uzbekistan where the banking sector generally does not meet the banking standards of more developed markets bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured and the banking system remains subject to instability a banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that receive or hold our funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in that region in addition some countries where we operate may impose regulatory or practical restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies within their banking systems which would limit our ability to use cash across our global operations and increase our exposure to currency fluctuations emerging market vulnerability and especially its impact on currency exchange volatility and banking systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense and increasing competition for customers and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services and other consulting companies if we are unable to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the market for our services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations customers tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues or place significant downward pressure on pricing among competing it services providers customers may prefer service providers that have more locations more personnel more experience in a particular country or market or that are based in countries that are more costcompetitive or have the perception of being more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate 

current or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore service providers which could harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our customers operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources therefore we may be unable to retain our customers or successfully attract new customers increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business 

complying with a wide variety of legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate can create risks to our operations and financial condition including liquidation of the subsidiaries that operate our major delivery centers 

our global operations require us to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions inflation unstable political and military situations labor issues and legal systems that make it more difficult to enforce intellectual property contractual or corporate rights certain legal provisions in russia belarus and ukraine where our local subsidiaries operate important delivery centers and employ a significant number of billable and support professionals may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if we fail to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of our local subsidiaries in court and creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims demand early performance of legal obligations and demand compensation for any damages involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided to companies in our industry by the governments of belarus and other countries 

in belarus one local subsidiary is a member along with other technology companies of hightechnologies park members have a full exemption from belarus income tax and value added tax until 2049 and are taxed at reduced amounts on obligatory social contributions and a variety of other taxes in russia our local subsidiary along with other qualified it companies benefit from paying obligatory social contributions to the government at a significantly reduced rate as well as an exemption from value added tax in certain circumstances if these tax benefits are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our operating expenses andor our effective income tax rate could increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provision for income taxes” 

risks related to regulation and legislation 

existing policy and substantial changes to fiscal political regulatory and other federal policies may adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in general economic or political conditions in the united states could adversely affect our business legacy us policy with respect to a variety of issues including international trade agreements conducting business offshore import and export regulations tariffs and customs duties foreign relations immigration laws and travel restrictions and corporate governance laws could have a positive or negative impact on our business 

the majority of our professionals are offshore companies that outsource services to organizations operating in other countries remains a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues the united states congress periodically proposes legislation that could impose restrictions on offshore outsourcing and on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to customer locations both of which could adversely impact our business such legislative measures could broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and contracts and impact private industry with tax disincentives intellectual property transfer restrictions and restrictions on the use or availability of certain work visas 

some of our projects require our personnel to obtain visas to travel and work at customer sites outside of our personnel’s home countries and often in the united states our reliance on visas to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed makes us vulnerable to legislative and administrative changes in the number of visas to be issued in any particular year and other work permit laws and regulations the process to obtain the required visas and work permits can be lengthy and difficult and variations due to political forces and economic conditions in the number of permitted applications as well as application and enforcement processes may cause delays or rejections when trying to obtain visas delays in obtaining visas may result in delays in the ability of our personnel to travel to meet with and provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely basis in addition the availability of a sufficient number of visas without significant additional costs could limit our ability to provide services to our customers on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could delays in or the unavailability of visas and work permits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in privacy and data protection regulations could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance 

epam is subject to the gdpr and the ccpa each of which imposes significant restrictions and requirements relating to the processing of personal data these and other national and international data protection laws are more burdensome than historical privacy standards especially in the united states the ccpa and gdpr each established complex legal obligations that organizations must follow with respect to the processing of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information to third parties or to other countries and the imposition of additional notification security and other control measures 

enforcement actions taken by the european union data protection authorities in the case of gdpr or by individuals or the california regulatory authorities in the case of the ccpa as well as audits or investigations by one or more individuals organizations or foreign government agencies could result in penalties and fines for noncompliance or direct claims against us in the event of any loss or damage as a result of a breach of these regulations the burden of compliance with additional data protection requirements may result in significant additional costs complexity and risk in our services and customers may seek to shift the potential risks resulting from the implementation of data privacy legislation to us we are required to establish processes and change certain operations in relation to the processing of personal data as a result of gdpr and ccpa which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws compliance with these laws requires significant resources and noncompliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

we are subject to many laws and regulations that restrict our international operations including laws that prohibit activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions the us office of foreign assets control or ofac and other international bodies have imposed sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are also subject to the fcpa and antibribery and anticorruption laws in other countries all of which prohibit companies and their intermediaries from bribing government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under us and other antibribery laws 

our compliance program contains controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac and other sanctions and laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of our compliance program may be time consuming expensive and could result in the discovery of compliance issues or violations by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents including third parties we associate with or companies we acquire could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in us under certain state laws 

risks related to our industry and customers 

we generally do not have longterm commitments from our customers our customers may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts and we are not guaranteed payment for services performed under contract a loss of business or nonpayment from significant customers could materially affect our results of operations 

our ability to maintain continuing relationships with our major customers and successfully obtain payment for our services is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific customer is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our customers’ exclusive it services provider and we generally do not have longterm commitments from customers to purchase our services we may also fail to adequately or accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers our customers’ ability to terminate engagements with or without cause and our customers’ inability or unwillingness to pay for services we performed makes our future revenues and profitability uncertain although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from customers who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our customers are typically for projects that are singular in nature therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end 

there are a number of factors relating to our customers that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate or not renew a contract or project with us or be unable to pay us including 

• financial difficulties 

• corporate restructuring or mergers and acquisitions activity 

• our inability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues 

• change in strategic priorities or economic conditions resulting in elimination of the impetus for the project or a reduced level of technology related spending 

• change in outsourcing strategy resulting in moving more work to the customer’s inhouse technology departments or to our competitors and 

• replacement of existing software with packaged software supported by licensors 

termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and thus compress our margins until we are able to reallocate our headcount customers that delay payment request modifications to their payment arrangements or fail to meet their payment obligations to us could increase our cash collection time cause us to incur bad debt expense or cause us to incur expenses in collections actions the loss of any of our major customers a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or price they are willing or able to pay us if not replaced by new service engagements and revenue could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our customers are concentrated in five specific industry verticals financial services software  hitech business information  media travel  consumer and life sciences  healthcare our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from customers in these five industry verticals and other industries that we target or may target in the future and also depends on trends in these industries to outsource the type of services we provide 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations other developments in the industries in which we operate may increase the demand for lower cost or lower quality it services and decrease the demand for our services or increase the pressure our customers put on us to reduce pricing we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes which could adversely affect our results of operations 

furthermore developments in the industries we serve could shift customer demand to new services solutions or technology if our customers demand new services solutions or technologies we may be less competitive in these new areas or may need to make significant investments to meet that demand additionally as we expand into serving new industry verticals our solutions and technology may be used by or generally affect a broader base of customers and end users which may expose us to new business and operational risks 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts and setting terms with our customers our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts assumptions and predictions about our projects the marketplace global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility and the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies larger and more complex projects that involve multiple engagements or stages heighten those pricing risks because a customer may choose not to retain us for additional stages or delay forecasted engagements which disrupts our planned project resource requirements if our pricing for a project includes dedicated personnel or facilities and the customer were to slow or stop that project we may not be able to reallocate resources to other customers our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated longterm cost savings that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract because of such inherent uncertainties we may underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts such as defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules the risk of underpricing our services or underestimating the costs of performing the work is heightened in fixedprice contracts and in contracts that require our customer to receive a productivity benefit as a result of the services performed under the contract if we fail to accurately estimate the resources time or quality levels required to complete such engagements or if the cost to us of employees facilities or technology unexpectedly increases we could be exposed to cost overruns any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of the services including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable 

our industry is sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies further weaken or are slow to recover from their current condition pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology related spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our services before potential customers commit to use our services they require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our customers’ decision to select another service provider or inhouse resources to perform the services the timing of our customers’ budget cycles and customer procurement and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it could negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth in certain cases we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract which may cause fluctuations in recognizing revenues between periods or jeopardize our ability to collect payment from customers 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our customers and us our current and future customers may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential customers despite devoting significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services processes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose customers and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our products and services our ability to anticipate developments in our industry enhance our existing services develop and introduce new services provide enhancements and new features for our products and keep pace with changes and developments are critical to meeting changing customer needs developing solutions for our customers is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with anticipate or respond to changes and developments is subject to a number of risks including that 

• we may not be able to develop new or update existing services applications tools and software quickly or inexpensively enough to meet our customers’ needs 

• we may find it difficult or costly to make existing software and products work effectively and securely over the internet or with new or changed operating systems 

• we may find it challenging to develop new or update existing software services and products to keep pace with evolving industry standards methodologies and regulatory developments in the industries where our customers operate at a pace and cost that is acceptable to our customers and 

• we may find it difficult to maintain high quality levels with new technologies and methodologies 

we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services products technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services products technologies or methodologies that our competitors develop may render our services or products noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and products and to develop and introduce new services and products to promptly address the needs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of business or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect or correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current customers revenues market share or customer data a failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance and could divert development resources and increase support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our customers and us errors will not be found in the software products we develop or the services we perform any such errors could result in claims for damages against us litigation and reputational harm that could materially adversely affect our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we collect store process transmit and view sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property or proprietary business information or personally identifiable information belonging to us our customers respective employees and other end users this information is stored in our data centers and networks or in the data centers and networks of thirdparty providers physical security and the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy some of our customers are seeking additional assurances for the protection of their sensitive information including personally identifiable information and attach greater liability in the event that their sensitive information is disclosed 

despite security measures information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error employee misconduct or malfeasance system failure or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks or the networks of our thirdparty providers and the information stored there could be accessed held for ransom publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen such a breach misappropriation or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by these events any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under applicable laws and regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

if we cause disruptions to our customers’ businesses provide inadequate service or breach contractual obligations our customers may have claims for substantial damages against us and our reputation may be damaged our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against such claims 

if our professionals make errors in the course of delivering services or we fail to meet contractual obligations to a customer these errors or failures could disrupt the customer’s business or expose confidential or personally identifiable information any of these events could result in a reduction in our revenues damage to our reputation and could also result in a customer terminating our engagement and making claims for substantial damages against us some of our customer agreements do not limit our potential liability for occurrences such as breaches of confidentiality and intellectual property infringement indemnity and we cannot generally limit liability to third parties with which we do not have a contractual relationship in some cases breaches of confidentiality obligations including obligations to protect personally identifiable information may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief 

although we maintain professional liability insurance product liability insurance commercial general and property insurance business interruption insurance workers’ compensation coverage and umbrella insurance for certain of our operations our insurance coverage does not insure against all risks in our operations or all claims we may receive damage claims from customers or third parties brought against us or claims that we initiate due to the disruption of our business litigation or natural disasters may not be covered by our insurance may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources even if insured some types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate and we cannot insure against damage to our reputation the assertion of one or more large claims against us whether or not successful and whether or not insured could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant failure in our systems telecommunications or it infrastructure could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenues and otherwise disrupt our business 

our service model relies on maintaining active voice and data communications online resource management financial and operational record management customer service and data processing systems between our customer sites our delivery centers and our customer management locations our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these technologies which could be due to software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrades damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control our crisis management procedures business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions particularly in the case of a catastrophic event loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete customer projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenues or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

our ability to generate and retain business could depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to customers and prospective customers based on a number of factors including reputation our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our customers’ evaluation of whether to engage our services our customers’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former customers and employees competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about us even if untrue could adversely affect our business could cause damage to our reputation and be challenging to repair could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new engagements and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark patent unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as in other countries with more developed intellectual property protections 

we require our employees and independent contractors to assign to us all intellectual property and work product they create in connection with their employment or engagement these assignment agreements also obligate our personnel to keep proprietary information confidential if these agreements are not enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate we cannot ensure that we will own the intellectual property they create or that our proprietary information will not be disclosed our customers and certain vendors are generally obligated to keep our information confidential but if these contractual obligations are not entered or are breached or deemed unenforceable our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information may be subject to unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our customers’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable unauthorized parties to benefit from our or our customers’ technologies tools and applications without payment and may make us liable to our customers for damages and compensation which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors we have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote additional resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks if we do enforce our trademarks and our other intellectual property rights through litigation we may not be successful and the litigation may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies products and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be unaware of intellectual property rights relating to our products or services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us if those intellectual property rights are potentially relevant to our service offerings we may need to license those rights in order to continue to use the applicable technology but the holders of those intellectual property rights may be unwilling to license those rights to us on commercially acceptable terms if at all there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that if subject to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties may become unavailable to us if such third parties obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property 

we typically indemnify customers who purchase our products services and solutions against potential infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk and cost of defending the underlying infringement claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers regardless of the merits of these claims and our indemnification obligations are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages intellectual property litigation could also divert our management’s attention from our business and existing or potential customers could defer or limit their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until we resolve such litigation if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing products services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property that such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our customers may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

expense related to our liabilityclassified restricted stock units which are subject to marktomarket accounting and the calculation of the weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding in accordance with the treasury method are both affected by our stock price any fluctuations in the price of our stock will affect our future operating results 

we may need additional capital and a failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions that we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another or larger credit facility and we cannot be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders and additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service costs and obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

our hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with a number of counterparties as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract during an economic downturn the counterparty’s financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure in the event of a counterparty default we could incur significant losses which may harm our business and financial condition in the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate our customers and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in the geographic regions where we operate war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake pandemics and other regional or global health crises storm or disease may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for the services we provide and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles our crisis management procedures business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disasters particularly in the case of a catastrophic event these events pose significant security risks to our people the facilities where they work our operations electricity and other utilities communications travel and network services and the disruption of any or all of them could materially adversely affect our financial results travel restrictions resulting from natural or manmade disruptions and political or social conflict increase the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified professionals and could unexpectedly increase our labor costs and expenses both of which could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in one or more jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including but not limited to a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our results of operations business and profitability in addition any significant changes enacted by the new us presidential administration to the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” enacted in 2017 or to regulatory guidance associated with the us tax act could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate

business update regarding covid19 

the covid19 pandemic continued to cause substantial global public health and economic challenges during the fourth quarter of 2020 and our employees communities and business operations as well as the global economy and financial markets all continue to be affected we cannot accurately predict the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to directly and indirectly impact our business results of operations and financial condition future developments and actions to contain the public health and economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on the markets we serve are rapidly evolving and highly uncertain 

to the extent that the remainder of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” refers to a financial or performance metric that has been affected by a trend or activity that reference is in addition to any impact of the covid19 pandemic disclosed in and supplemented by this section the information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our present awareness or control 

our covid19 pandemic response 

since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic we have made the safety and wellbeing of our employees our top priority as governments lift and reimpose restrictions on group gatherings commercial operations and travel and as vaccines and therapeutics become available we have applied those changing requirements to our business to maintain the health and safety of our employees and serve our customers consistent with appropriate public health considerations our business continuity plans are designed to ensure the safety and wellbeing of approximately 41000 epam professionals while supporting the operations of hundreds of customers around the world 

our employees 

the vast majority of our employees are able to productively and securely work from a remote location and our remaining personnel are providing services to us or our customers from our offices or our customers’ facilities we therefore do not expect that covid19 related restrictions on group gatherings and nonessential businesses will have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or productively deliver services to our customers nor on our financial reporting systems internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures with the increase in remote access to our systems and networks we have accelerated some ongoing security initiatives and programs 

many of the countries where our personnel regularly conduct business have extended or expanded restrictions on travel and immigration from other countries including a suspension of most immigration and nonimmigration visas issued by the united states further extensions or tightening of these travel and immigration restrictions may continue to impact our operations however we do not believe that the current travel and immigration restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

our customers 

our adaptive global delivery model enables us to deliver our services and solutions to our customers from remote locations so we continue to provide our customers with the products services and solutions they seek to deliver their business results we continually assess our customers’ current and future needs for epam personnel to work at their facilities and our global delivery centers so that we can deploy resources safely and in accordance with covid19 mitigation efforts 

the prolonged deterioration of economic conditions for some of our customers could materially reduce our sales and profitability reduced demand from our customers and their customers persistent financial distress in our customer base and the continued volatility in macroeconomic conditions has and could continue to adversely impact revenues and decrease the collectability of our trade receivables any or all of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations depending on the duration of the covid19 pandemic and the timing and speed of economic recovery reduced revenue growth relative to prior years could extend beyond the fourth quarter of 2020

overview of 2020 and financial highlights 

the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2020 were as follows 

• we recorded revenues of 27 billion or a 159 increase from 23 billion in the previous year negatively impacted by 08 million or 01 due to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year 

• income from operations grew 253 to 3793 million from 3029 million in 2019 expressed as a percentage of revenues income from operations was 143 compared to 132 the increase in income from operations as a percentage of revenues during the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by a reduction in travelrelated expenses reported in cost of revenues and a reduction in travelrelated recruitment and facilities expenses reported in selling general and administrative expenses which was partially offset by an increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues attributable to temporary discounts provided to certain customers experiencing challenging economic conditions due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

• our effective tax rate was 136 compared to 128 in the previous year the provision for income taxes was impacted primarily by the excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stockbased awards in 2020 and 2019 

• net income increased 253 to 3272 million compared to 2611 million in 2019 expressed as a percentage of revenues net income increased 09 compared to last year which was largely driven by the improvement in income from operations and partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 

• diluted earnings per share increased 236 to 560 for the year ended december 31 2020 from 453 in 2019 

• cash provided by operations increased 2570 million or 894 to 5444 million during 2020 as compared to last year this increase is largely driven by the increase in net income improvements in collections from customers and reduced income tax payments compared to 2019 

the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report additional information on our policies is in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k 

revenues — we recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price variable consideration usually takes the form of volumebased discounts service level credits price concessions or incentives determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported 

we derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to customers by combining software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements we generate the majority of our revenues under timeandmaterial contracts which are billed using hourly daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the customer we apply a practical expedient and revenues related to timeandmaterial contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed 

fixedprice contracts include maintenance and support arrangements which may exceed one year in duration maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period fixedprice contracts also include application development arrangements where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period 

revenues from licenses which have significant standalone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer revenues from licenses which do not have standalone functionality are recognized over time if there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is one year or less 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

business combinations  — we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions used include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates customer attrition rates the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finitelived assets there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain the acquired assets typically include customer relationships software trade names noncompetition agreements and assembled workforce and as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

if the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date revisions to the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings 

leases — we determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception we perform an assessment and classify the lease as either an operating lease or a financing lease at the lease commencement date with a rightofuse asset “rou asset” and a lease liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under both classifications 

lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid the present value is determined by applying the readily determinable rate implicit in the lease or if not available the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee we determine the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee on a leasebylease basis by developing an estimated centralized us dollar borrowing rate for a fully collateralized obligation with a term similar to the lease term and adjust the rate to reflect the incremental risk associated with the currency in which the lease is denominated the development of this estimate includes the use of recovery rates us riskfree rates foreign currencycountry base rate yields and a synthetic corporate credit rating of the company developed using regression analysis our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease we include such options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option rou assets are recognized based on the initial measurement of the lease liabilities plus initial direct costs less lease incentives lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term rou assets are subject to periodic impairment tests 

we have elected a practical expedient to account for lease and nonlease components together as a single lease component in addition we elected the shortterm lease recognition exemption for all classes of lease assets

results of operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 





1 includes 32785 37580 and 27245 of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

2 includes 42453 34456 and 31943 of stockbased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

revenues 

we continue to expand our presence across multiple geographies and verticals both organically and through strategic acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2020 our total revenues grew 159 over the previous year to 27 billion this growth resulted from our ability to retain existing customers and increase the level of services we provide to them and our ability to produce revenues from new customer relationships during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced an increase in customer concentration as compared to the previous year with revenues from our top five top ten and top twenty customer groups increasing as a percentage of total revenues as we met higher demand from our larger customers revenues have been positively impacted by our acquisitions in 2020 which contributed 03 to our revenue growth and negatively impacted by the fluctuations in foreign currency which decreased our revenue growth by 01 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the previous year 

we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical customer location service arrangement type and customer concentration 

revenues by vertical 

we assign our customers into one of our five main vertical markets or a group of various industries where we are increasing our presence which we label as “emerging verticals” including energy utilities manufacturing automotive telecommunications and several others 

the following table presents our revenues by vertical and revenues as a percentage of total revenues by vertical for the periods indicated 



business information  media became our largest vertical during 2020 growing 332 as compared to 2019 largely driven by growth in one of our top 5 customers and the expansion of services to a customer which was previously in our top 50 customers and is now in our top 10 customers financial services grew at a slower rate of 109 in 2020 over the prior year largely due to a change in certain customers’ business models associated with lowcost trading platforms travel  consumer also grew at a slower rate of 44 during 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to declining demand from certain customers adversely affected by the decline in global travel due to worldwide travel restrictions as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

revenues by customer location 

our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets north america europe cis and apac we present and discuss our revenues by customer location based on the location of the specific customer site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the customer or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed revenues by customer location is different from revenues by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report segments are not based on the geographic location of the customers but instead they are based on the location of the company’s management responsible for a particular customer or market 

the following table sets forth revenues by customer location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 





1 cis includes revenues from customers in russia belarus kazakhstan ukraine and georgia 

2 apac or asia pacific includes revenues from customers in east asia southeast asia and australia 

during the year ended december 31 2020 revenues in our largest geography north america were 15951 million growing 2051 million or 148 from 13900 million reported for the year ended december 31 2019 revenues from this geography accounted for 600 of total revenues in 2020 a decrease from 606 in the prior year the united states continued to be our largest customer location contributing revenues of 15237 million in 2020 compared to 13217 million in 2019 

revenues in our europe geography were 8798 million an increase of 1330 million or 178 over 7469 million in the previous year revenues in this geography accounted for 331 of consolidated revenues in 2020 as compared to 326 in the previous year the top three revenue contributing customer location countries in europe were the united kingdom switzerland and the netherlands generating revenues of 3312 million 2034 million and 1147 million in 2020 respectively compared to 2900 million 1527 million and 885 million in 2019 respectively fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the us dollar particularly the euro and the british pound during 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year positively impacted revenue growth in the european geography by 19 

during 2020 revenues in the cis geography increased 142 million or 142 from the previous year the increase in cis revenues came from customers in russia contributing 149 million of revenue growth in 2020 compared to the previous year partially offset by decreases in revenues in other cis countries 

revenues from customers in locations in the apac region comprised 26 of total revenues in 2020 a level consistent with the prior year 

discussion of revenues from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

revenues by customer concentration 

we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers and we seek to grow revenues from our existing customers by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon beginning or completion of multiyear projects we believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing customers in addition we remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more customers to our client mix however the covid19 pandemic disrupted the economic landscape during 2020 and influenced business decisions of our existing and potential customers we were able to capitalize on demand for our services at our larger customers whereas we realized less revenue growth from our smaller customers however over the longterm we expect revenue concentration from our top customers to decrease 

the following table presents revenues contributed by our customers by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 



the following table shows the number of customers grouped by revenues recognized by the company for each year presented 



revenues by service offering 

our service arrangements have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our customers where we combine software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services we are continually expanding our service capabilities moving beyond traditional services into business consulting design and physical product development 

the following table shows revenues by service offering as an amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the years indicated 



see note 11 “revenues” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our contract types and related revenue recognition policies 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation projectrelated travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to customer projects salaries and other compensation expenses of our delivery professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing customer services during a given period our employees are a critical asset necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs 

we manage the utilization levels of our delivery professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects some of these professionals are hired and trained to work for specific customers or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific customers or projects our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services 

during the year ended december 31 2020 cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 17325 million representing an increase of 164 from 14882 million reported last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 168 growth in the average number of production headcount for the year partially offset by a lower level of accrued variable compensation in 2020 as compared to the previous year 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 651 and 649 during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the yearoveryear increase is primarily due to declining profitability on certain accounts due to temporary discounts provided to certain customers experiencing challenging economic conditions due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by a reduction in travelrelated expenses due to the restrictions of travel attributable to the covid19 pandemic 

discussion of cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business these expenses include the costs of salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation severance bad debt travel legal and accounting services insurance facilities including operating leases advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hightechnologies park 

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased due to our continuously expanding operations strategic business acquisitions and the hiring of necessary personnel to support our growth during the year ended december 31 2020 selling general and administrative expenses were 4848 million representing an increase of 60 as compared to 4574 million reported last year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2020 was primarily due to a 440 million increase in personnelrelated costs which include stockbased compensation expense primarily driven by an increase in headcount and partially offset by a reduction in talent acquisition and development expenses and a 35 million decrease in costs for software licenses 

expressed as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses decreased 17 to 182 for the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 07 decrease in travel and entertainment expenses as a percentage of revenues resulting from the worldwide restriction on travel due to covid19 a 06 decrease in facilityrelated expenses as a percentage of revenues reduced talent acquisition and development expenses attributable to reduced hiring efforts in the first half of the year in response to the covid19 pandemic as well as reduced costs for software licenses partially offset by an increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense 

discussion of selling general and administrative expenses from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

depreciation and amortization expense 

during the year ended december 31 2020 depreciation and amortization expense was 629 million representing an increase of 176 million from 453 million reported last year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth and the purchase of certain longerterm software licenses depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finitelived intangible assets expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense increased to 24 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 20 in 2019 

discussion of depreciation and amortization expense from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and employee housing loans gains and losses from certain financial instruments interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration there were no material changes in interest and other income net in 2020 as compared to 2019 and 2018 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment we consider factors that may contribute favorably or unfavorably to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future these factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items 

as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2020 2019 and 2018 we had 2781 million 2342 million and 2052 million respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest and penalty expense tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

in belarus member technology companies of hightechnologies park including our local subsidiary have a full exemption from belarus income tax on qualifying income through january 2049 however beginning february 1 2018 the earnings of the company’s belarus local subsidiary became subject to us income taxation due to the company’s decision to change the tax status of the subsidiary consequently there was less income tax benefit from the belarus tax exemption during 2018 compared to the previous year there was no aggregate dollar benefit derived from this tax holiday for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 and the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated 14 million for the year ended december 31 2018 there was no impact on diluted net income per share for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated 002 for the year ended december 31 2018 

the provision for income taxes was 513 million in 2020 and 385 million in 2019 the increase was primarily driven by the increase in pretax income year over year partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recorded upon vesting or exercise of stockbased awards which were 366 million in 2020 compared to 284 million in 2019 the effective tax rate increased from 128 in 2019 to 136 in 2020 primarily due to mix in profitability in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the tax treatment of certain acquisitionrelated costs 

discussion of the provision for income taxes from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

foreign exchange gain  loss 

for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — foreign exchange risk” 

results by business segment 

our operations consist of three reportable segments north america europe and russia the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and segment operating profits segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses certain corporate expenses are not allocated to specific segments as these expenses are not controllable at the segment level such expenses include certain types of professional fees certain taxes included in operating expenses including the belarus hightechnologies park membership fee compensation to nonemployee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses including compensation of specific groups of nonproduction employees in addition the company does not allocate amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations goodwill and other asset impairment charges stockbased compensation expenses acquisitionrelated costs and certain other onetime charges these unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations 

we manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for the client base and market as managerial responsibility for a particular customer relationship generally correlates with the customer’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between customer locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some cases managerial responsibility for a particular customer is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between customer executives and particular members of epam’s senior management team in such cases the customer’s activity would be reported through the respective management team member’s reportable segment our europe segment includes our business in the apac region which is managed by the same management team 

segment revenues from external customers and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe and russia segments for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



north america segment 

during 2020 north america segment revenues increased 2209 million or 160 over last year revenues from our north america segment represented 602 of total segment revenues during both 2020 and 2019 during 2020 as compared to 2019 north america segment operating profits increased 514 million or 175 to 3452 million expressed as a percentage of revenue north america segment operating profit increased to 216 in 2020 as compared to 213 in 2019 

the following table presents north america segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 



software  hitech remained the largest industry vertical in the north america segment during the year ended december 31 2020 growing 186 as compared to the prior year which was a result of the continued focus on working with our technology customers revenues from the business information  media vertical grew 273 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year and largely benefited from expansion of services to a single customer which was previously one of our top 50 customers and is now one of our top 10 customers financial services grew at a slower rate of 82 in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a change in certain customers’ business models associated with lowcost trading platforms emerging verticals experienced slower growth during 2020 compared to the prior year largely due to slower growth from energy customers in the us who were adversely impacted by deteriorating economic conditions 

europe segment 

during 2020 europe segment revenues were 9473 million reflecting an increase of 1266 million or 154 from last year revenues were positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2020 had our europe segment revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2019 we would have reported revenue growth of 136 revenues from our europe segment represent 356 and 358 of total segment revenues during 2020 and 2019 respectively during 2020 this segment’s operating profits increased 380 million or 331 as compared to last year to 1529 million europe’s operating profit represented 161 of europe segment revenues as compared to 140 in 2019 segment operating profit was positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during 2020 and reduced selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by temporary discounts provided to certain customers experiencing challenging economic conditions due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the following table presents europe segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 



the europe segment benefited from strong growth in the business information  media vertical of 425 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 largely driven by growth in revenues from one of our top five customers financial services remained the largest industry vertical in the europe segment during the year ended december 31 2020 revenues in travel  consumer decreased during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to declining demand from certain customers adversely impacted by the decline in global travel due to worldwide travel restrictions as a result of the covid19 pandemic revenues in software  hitech also decreased during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a change in the estimate of variable consideration associated with a single customer 

russia segment 

during 2020 revenues from our russia segment increased 182 million relative to 2019 and represent 42 of total segment revenues during 2020 compared with 40 in 2019 operating profits of our russia segment decreased 115 million as compared to 2019 expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues the segment’s operating profits were 53 and 188 in 2020 and 2019 respectively this decrease is primarily attributable to costs incurred without recognizing corresponding revenues due to the delays in the timing of execution of contracts during 2020 

the following table presents russia segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 



revenues in the russia segment are generally subject to fluctuations and there have been no significant changes in the individual verticals during 2020 as compared to 2019 russia segment revenues were mainly impacted by the timing of revenue recognition associated with the execution of contracts and the devaluation of the russian ruble relative to the us dollar had our russia segment revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2019 we would have reported revenue growth of 361 

currency fluctuations of the russian ruble typically impact the results in the russia segment ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and the volatility of the russian ruble can significantly impact reported revenues and profitability in this segment we continue to monitor geopolitical forces economic and trade sanctions and other issues involving this region 

discussion of segment results from 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in “part ii item 7 results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

effects of inflation 

economies in some countries where we operate particularly belarus russia kazakhstan uzbekistan ukraine and india have periodically experienced high rates of inflation periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business as of december 31 2020 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 13221 million shortterm investments of 600 million as well as 2750 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we have cash in banks in belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan armenia georgia and uzbekistan where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured as of december 31 2020 the total amount of cash held in these countries was 1462 million and of this amount 529 million was located in belarus the company regularly monitors cash held in these countries and to the extent the cash held exceeds amounts required to support our operations in these countries the company distributes the excess funds into markets with more developed banking sectors 

as of december 31 2020 we had 2750 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and had outstanding debt of 250 million as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all covenants specified under the credit facility and anticipate being in compliance for the foreseeable future see note 9 “longterm debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our longterm debt 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility 

based on currently available information and management’s current expectations we anticipate that we have sufficient cash on hand and sufficient access to capital to continue to fund our operations for a significant period of time however covid19 and related measures to contain its impact have caused material disruptions in both national and global financial markets and economies the future impact of covid19 and the covid19 containment measures cannot be predicted with certainty and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2020 increased 2570 million or 894 to 5444 million as compared to 2019 primarily driven by the increase in net income and a larger improvement in days sales outstanding during 2020 compared to 2019 which resulted in higher cash collections during 2020 as compared to 2019 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2020 was 1672 million compared to 1454 million used in the same period in 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to 600 million of net cash invested into time deposits classified as shortterm investments partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of 305 million 

financing activities 

during the year ended december 31 2020 net cash used in financing activities was 08 million compared to 204 million net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 during 2020 we received 106 million less cash from exercises of stock options issued under our longterm incentive plans we paid 59 million more in contingent consideration related to acquisitions of businesses and we paid 46 million more of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units compared to 2019 

discussion of the comparison of the cash flows between 2019 and 2018 is included in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 





as of december 31 2020 we had 33 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters in addition we had recorded 75 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2020 related to the acquisitions of businesses that are not included in the table above due to the uncertainty involved with the potential payments 

see note 15 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 for information regarding contractual obligations 

future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future however our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors including the impact of the covid19 pandemic as described elsewhere in this mda to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 15 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks primarily result from changes in concentration of credit risks interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and trade receivables 

we maintain our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we have cash in banks in countries such as belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan armenia georgia and uzbekistan where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured as of december 31 2020 1462 million of total cash was kept in banks in these countries of which 529 million was held in belarus in this region and particularly in belarus a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the region which could adversely affect our business and financial condition cash in this region is used for shortterm operational needs and cash balances in those banks move with the needs of the local entities the company regularly monitors cash held in these countries and to the extent the cash held exceeds amounts required to support our operations in these countries the company distributes the excess funds into markets with more developed banking sectors 

trade receivables are generally dispersed across many customers operating in different industries therefore concentration of credit risk is limited and we do not believe significant credit risks existed at december 31 2020 though our results of operations depend on our ability to successfully collect payment from our customers for work performed historically credit losses and writeoffs of trade receivables have not been material to our consolidated financial statements if any of our customers enter bankruptcy protection or otherwise take steps to alleviate their financial distress including distress resulting from the covid19 pandemic our credit losses and writeoffs of trade receivables could increase which would negatively impact our results of operations 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is influenced by the changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalent deposits shortterm investments and paid on any outstanding balance on our borrowings mainly under our 2017 credit facility which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the currency and timing of funds borrowed we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to these deposits investments and borrowings 

foreign exchange risk 

our global operations are conducted predominantly in us dollars other than us dollars the company generates revenues in various currencies principally euros british pounds russian rubles swiss francs and canadian dollars and incurs expenditures principally in russian rubles polish zlotys euros swiss francs hungarian forints british pounds indian rupees chinese yuan renminbi and mexican pesos as a result currency fluctuations specifically the depreciation of the euro british pound and canadian dollar and the appreciation of the russian ruble hungarian forint polish zloty indian rupee and chinese yuan renminbi relative to the us dollar could negatively impact our results of operations 

during the year ended december 31 2020 our foreign exchange loss was 47 million compared to a 120 million loss reported last year during the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 317 of consolidated revenues and 414 of operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated operating expenses in the normal course of business we implemented a hedging program through which we enter into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts with durations of twelve months or less that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted russian ruble polish zloty and indian rupee transactions as of december 31 2020 the net unrealized gain from these hedges was 47 million 

management supplements results reported in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles referred to as gaap with nongaap financial measures management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating its performance when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared on the basis of “constant currency” which is a nongaap financial measure this measure excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we reported revenue growth of 159 over the prior year had our consolidated revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2019 we would have reported revenue growth of 160 during 2020 revenues have been negatively impacted by the depreciation of the russian ruble relative to the us dollar partially offset by the appreciation of the euro british pound and swiss franc relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2020 we reported net income growth of 253 over the previous year had our consolidated results been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2019 we would have reported net income growth of 177 net income benefited primarily from the appreciation of the euro and depreciation of the hungarian forint russian ruble and mexican peso relative to the us dollar

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management has excluded certain business acquisitions from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 since these entities were acquired in business combinations in 2020 these businesses are included in our 2020 consolidated financial statements and constituted 15 of total assets as of december 31 2020 and 02 of revenues for the year then ended

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our customers we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us which assign to us all deliverable intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or provision of services these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential 

we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our customers these customary agreements cover our use of our customers’ software systems and platforms as our customers usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them furthermore we often grant a perpetual worldwide royaltyfree nonexclusive transferable and nonrevocable license to our customers to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we develop for them 

regulations 

due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations several foreign and us federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business see “item 1a risk factors — risks relating to our business” we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and similar anticorruption laws and data privacy regulations compliance with these laws requires significant resources and noncompliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock listed below not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence are the most significant risk factors applicable to us additionally forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “forwardlooking statements” 

risks relating to our business 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management systems resources and results of operations 

we have grown rapidly and significantly expanded our business over the past several years both organically and through strategic acquisitions our growth has resulted in part from managing larger and more complex projects for our customers but consequently requires that we invest substantial amounts of cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure our rapid growth places significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure and creates challenges including 

 we intend to continue our expansion and pursue available opportunities for the foreseeable future as we introduce new services enter into new markets and take on increasingly large and complex projects our business may face new risks and challenges if customers do not choose us for large and complex projects or we do not effectively manage those projects our reputation business and financial goals may be damaged we need to generate business and revenues to support new facilities and infrastructure projects if the challenges associated with expansion negatively impact our anticipated growth and margins our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we must successfully attract hire train and retain qualified personnel to service our customers’ projects and we must productively utilize those personnel to remain profitable 

hiring and retaining professionals with diverse skill sets across our broad geography of operations is critical to maintaining existing engagements and obtaining new business if we do not deploy those professionals and use computers office space and other fixedcost resources productively our profitability will be significantly impacted we must manage the utilization levels of the professionals that we hire and train by planning for future needs effectively and staffing projects appropriately while accurately predicting the general economy and our customers’ need for our services if we are unable to attract hire train and retain highly skilled personnel and productively deploy them on customer projects we will jeopardize our ability to meet and develop ongoing and future business and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

competition for highly skilled professionals is intense in the markets where we operate and we may experience significant employee turnover rates due to such competition if we are unable to retain professionals with specialized skills our revenues operating efficiency and profitability will decrease cost reductions such as reducing headcount or voluntary departures that result from our failure to retain the professionals we hire could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire personnel to meet our business requirements price increases could lead to a decline in demand for our services 

increases in wages equity compensation and other compensation expenses could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage increase our costs and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wages for technology professionals in the emerging markets where we have significant operations and delivery centers are lower than comparable wages in more developed countries however wages in the technology industry in these countries may increase at a faster rate than in the past which may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our people if we increase operations and hiring in more developed economies our compensation expenses will increase because of the higher wages demanded by technology professionals in those markets wage inflation whether driven by competition for talent or ordinary course pay increases may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability if we are not able to pass those costs on to our customers or charge premium prices when justified by market demand 

we expect to continue our practice of granting equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and paying other stockbased compensation the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may make issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plans less attractive to us but if we reduce the amount or value of equity award grants we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel conversely if we grant more or higher value equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the equity compensation expenses could materially adversely affect our results of operations new regulations volatility in our stock and dilution to our stockholders could diminish our use and the value of our equitybased awards this could put us at a competitive disadvantage or cause us to reconsider our compensation practices 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions we may not be able to replace them easily or at all if any of our senior executives or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose customers suppliers knowhow and other key personnel to those competitors if we are unable to attract new senior executives or key personnel due to the intense competition for talent in our industry it could disrupt our business operations and growth 

our operations in emerging markets subject us to greater economic financial and banking risks than we would face in more developed markets 

we have significant operations in certain emerging market economies in eastern europe india and other asian countries emerging markets are vulnerable to market and economic volatility to a greater extent than more developed markets which presents risks to our business and operations a majority of our revenues are generated in north america and western europe however most of our personnel and delivery centers are located in lower cost locations including emerging markets this exposes us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues compensation purchases capital expenditures receivables and other balancesheet items as we continue to leverage and expand our global delivery model into other emerging markets a larger portion of our revenues and incurred expenses may be in currencies other than us dollars currency exchange volatility caused by economic instability or other factors could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

the economies of certain emerging market countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns we have cash in banks in countries such as belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan armenia and uzbekistan where the banking sector generally does not meet the banking standards of more developed markets bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured and the banking system remains subject to instability a banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that receive or hold our funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in that region in addition some countries where we operate may impose regulatory or practical restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies within their banking systems which would limit our ability to use cash across our global operations and increase our exposure to currency fluctuations emerging market vulnerability and especially its impact on currency exchange volatility and banking systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters including the ongoing conflict in ukraine may affect the markets in which we operate our customers and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in the geographic regions where we operate war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake pandemics and other regional or global health crises storm or disease may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for the services we provide and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles our crisis management procedures business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disasters particularly in the case of a catastrophic event these events pose significant security risks to our people the facilities where they work our operations electricity and other utilities communications travel and network services and the disruption of any or all of them could materially adversely affect our financial results travel restrictions resulting from natural or manmade disruptions and political or social conflict increase the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified professionals and could unexpectedly increase our labor costs and expenses both of which could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

in particular continuing military activities in ukraine and ukraine’s weak economic conditions have fueled ongoing economic uncertainty in ukraine russia and other markets and the uncertainty is exacerbated by existing and threatened economic sanctions imposed by the european union united states and other nations on certain russian entities in the energy defense and financial sectors we have delivery centers in both ukraine and russia and between 35 and 40 of our billable professionals have been located in those two countries since the military activities began in 2014 although none are located in the most volatile regions of eastern ukraine long term disputes over russia’s supply of oil and gas to belarus have also reemerged to date we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our customers we continue to monitor the situation closely and have developed contingency plans to relocate work andor personnel to other locations and add new locations as appropriate but prolonged political instability in ukraine sanctions against russia russia’s potential response to such sanctions and tension between russia and belarus over energy supply could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the us congress and trump administration may make substantial changes to fiscal political regulatory and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in general economic or political conditions in the united states could adversely affect our business for example the administration under president donald trump has put forth and may continue to propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues including international trade agreements and conducting business offshore import and export regulations tariffs and customs duties foreign relations immigration laws and travel restrictions and corporate governance laws that could have a positive or negative impact on our business 

the majority of our professionals are offshore companies that outsource services to organizations operating in other countries remains a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues proposed legislation in the united states could impose restrictions on offshore outsourcing and on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to customer locations both of which could adversely impact our business such legislative measures could broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and contracts and impact private industry with tax disincentives intellectual property transfer restrictions and restrictions on the use or availability of certain work visas 

some of our projects require our personnel to obtain visas to travel and work at client sites outside of our personnel’s home countries our reliance on visas to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed makes us vulnerable to legislative and administrative changes in visa and work permit laws and regulations the process to obtain the required visas and work permits can be lengthy and difficult and variations in application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions may cause delays or rejections when trying to obtain visas delays in obtaining visas may result in delays in the ability of our personnel to travel to meet with and provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely basis in addition the availability of a sufficient number of visas without significant additional costs could limit our ability to provide services to our customers on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could delays in or the unavailability of visas and work permits could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we do not have longterm commitments from our customers our customers may terminate contracts before completion choose not to renew contracts and we are not guaranteed payment for services performed under contract a loss of business or nonpayment from significant customers could materially affect our results of operations 

our ability to maintain continuing relationships with our major customers and successfully obtain payment for our services is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific customer is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our customers’ exclusive it services provider and we generally do not have longterm commitments from customers to purchase our services we may also fail to adequately or accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers our customers’ ability to terminate engagements with or without cause and our customers’ inability or unwillingness to pay for services we performed makes our future revenues and profitability uncertain although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from customers who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our customers are typically for projects that are singular in nature therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end 

there are a number of factors relating to our customers that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate or not renew a contract or project with us or be unable to pay us including 

 termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and thus compress our margins until we are able to reallocate our headcount customers that delay payment request modifications to their payment arrangements or fail to meet their payment obligations to us could increase our cash collection time or cause us to incur bad debt expense the loss of any of our major customers a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or price they are willing or able to pay us if not replaced by new service engagements and revenue could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our customers are concentrated in five specific industry verticals financial services software  hitech business information  media travel  consumer and life sciences  healthcare our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from customers in these five industry verticals and other industries that we target or may target in the future and also depends on trends in these industries to outsource the type of services we provide 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations other developments in the industries in which we operate may increase the demand for lower cost or lower quality it services and decrease the demand for our services or increase the pressure our customers put on us to reduce pricing we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes which could adversely affect our results of operations 

furthermore developments in the industries we serve could shift customer demand to new services solutions or technology if our customers demand new services solutions or technologies we may be less competitive in these new areas or may need to make significant investments to meet that demand additionally as we expand into serving new industry verticals our solutions and technology may be used by or generally affect a broader base of customers and end users which may expose us to new business and operational risks 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts and setting terms with our customers our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts assumptions and predictions about our projects the marketplace global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility and the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies larger and more complex projects that involve multiple engagements or stages heighten those pricing risks because a customer may choose not to retain us for additional stages or delay forecasted engagements which disrupts our planned project resource requirements if our pricing for a project includes dedicated personnel or facilities and the customer were to slow or stop that project we may not be able to reallocate resources to other customers our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated longterm cost savings that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract because of these inherent uncertainties we may underprice our projects fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts such as defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules the risk of underpricing our services or underestimating the costs of performing the work is heightened in fixed price contracts and in contracts that require our customer to receive a productivity benefit as a deliverable under the contract if we fail to accurately estimate the resources time or quality levels required to complete such engagements or if the cost to us of employees facilities or technology unexpectedly increases we could be exposed to cost overruns any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of the services including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable 

our industry is sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology related spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our services before potential customers commit to use our services they require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our customers’ decision to select another service provider or inhouse resources to perform the services the timing of our customers’ budget cycles and customer procurement and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it could negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth in certain cases we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract which may cause fluctuations in recognizing revenues between periods or jeopardize our ability to collect payment from customers 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our customers and us our current and future customers may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential customers despite devoting significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services processes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we face intense and increasing competition for customers and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services and other consulting companies if we are unable to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the market for our services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations customers tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues or place significant downward pressure on pricing among competing it services providers customers may prefer service providers that have more locations more personnel more experience in a particular country or market or that are based in countries that are more costcompetitive or have the perception of being more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate 

current or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore service providers which could harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our customers operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources therefore we may be unable to retain our customers or successfully attract new customers increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose customers and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our products and services our ability to anticipate developments in our industry enhance our existing services develop and introduce new services provide enhancements and new features for our products and keep pace with changes and developments are critical to meeting changing customer needs developing solutions for our customers is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with anticipate or respond to changes and developments is subject to a number of risks including that 

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services products technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services products technologies or methodologies that our competitors develop may render our services or products noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and products and to develop and introduce new services and products to promptly address the needs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of business or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect or correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current customers revenues market share or customer data a failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance and could divert development resources and increase support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our customers and us errors will not be found in the software products we develop or the services we perform any such errors could result in claims for damages against us litigation and reputational harm that could materially adversely affect our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we collect store process transmit and view sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property or proprietary business information or personally identifiable information belonging to us our customers respective employees and other end users this information is stored in our data centers and networks or in the data centers and networks of thirdparty providers physical security and the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy some of our customers are seeking additional assurances for the protection of their sensitive information including personally identifiable information and attach greater liability in the event that their sensitive information is disclosed 

despite security measures information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error employee misconduct or malfeasance system failure or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks or the networks of our thirdparty providers and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen such a breach misappropriation or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by these events any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under applicable laws and regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

if we cause disruptions to our customers’ businesses provide inadequate service or breach contractual obligations our customers may have claims for substantial damages against us and our reputation may be damaged our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against such claims 

if our professionals make errors in the course of delivering services or we fail to meet contractual obligations to a customer these errors or failures could disrupt the customer’s business or expose confidential or personally identifiable information any of these events could result in a reduction in our revenues damage to our reputation and could also result in a customer terminating our engagement and making claims for substantial damages against us some of our customer agreements do not limit our potential liability for occurrences such as breaches of confidentiality and intellectual property infringement indemnity and we cannot generally limit liability to third parties with which we do not have a contractual relationship in some cases breaches of confidentiality obligations including obligations to protect personally identifiable information may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief 

although we maintain professional liability insurance product liability insurance commercial general and property insurance business interruption insurance workers’ compensation coverage and umbrella insurance for certain of our operations our insurance coverage does not insure against all risks in our operations or all claims we may receive damage claims from customers or third parties brought against us or claims that we initiate due to the disruption of our business litigation or natural disasters may not be covered by our insurance may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources even if insured some types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate and we cannot insure against damage to our reputation the assertion of one or more large claims against us whether or not successful and whether or not insured could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant failure in our systems telecommunications or it infrastructure could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenues and otherwise disrupt our business 

our service model relies on maintaining active voice and data communications online resource management financial and operational record management customer service and data processing systems between our client sites our delivery centers and our customer management locations our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these technologies which could be due to software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrades damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control our crisis management procedures business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions particularly in the case of a catastrophic event loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete customer projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenues or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

our ability to generate and retain business could depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to customers and prospective customers based on a number of factors including reputation our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our customers’ evaluation of whether to engage our services our customers’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former customers and employees competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about us even if untrue could adversely affect our business could cause damage to our reputation and be challenging to repair could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new engagements and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if acquisitions do not perform to our expectations our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

strategic acquisitions are part of our expansion strategy but these transactions involve significant risks acquired companies may not advance our business strategy or achieve a satisfactory return on our investment we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired employees and business culture customer relationships or operations and acquisitions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business furthermore contracts between our acquisition targets and their customers may lack terms and conditions that adequately protect us against the risks associated with the services we provide which may increase our potential exposure to damages if not effectively managed the disruption of our ongoing business increases in our expenses including significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and difficulty and complexity of effectively integrating acquired operations may adversely affect our overall growth and profitability 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark patent unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as in the united states or other countries with more developed intellectual property protections 

we require our employees and independent contractors to assign to us all intellectual property and work product they create in connection with their employment or engagement these assignment agreements also obligate our personnel to keep proprietary information confidential if these agreements are not enforceable in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate we cannot ensure that we will own the intellectual property they create or that our proprietary information will not be disclosed our customers and certain vendors are generally obligated to keep our information confidential but if these contractual obligations are not entered or are breached or deemed unenforceable our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information may be subject to unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our customers’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable unauthorized parties to benefit from our or our customers’ technologies tools and applications without payment and may make us liable to our customers for damages and compensation which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors we have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote additional resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks if we do enforce our trademarks and our other intellectual property rights through litigation we may not be successful and the litigation may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies products and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be unaware of intellectual property rights relating to our products or services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us if those intellectual property rights are potentially relevant to our service offerings we may need to license those rights in order to continue to use the applicable technology but the holders of those intellectual property rights may be unwilling to license those rights to us on commercially acceptable terms if at all there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that if subject to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties may become unavailable to us if such third parties obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property 

we typically indemnify customers who purchase our products services and solutions against potential infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk and cost of defending the underlying infringement claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers regardless of the merits of these claims and our indemnification obligations are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages intellectual property litigation could also divert our management’s attention from our business and existing or potential customers could defer or limit their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until we resolve such litigation if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing products services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property that such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our customers may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws compliance with these laws requires significant resources and noncompliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

we are subject to many laws and regulations that restrict our international operations including laws that prohibit activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions the us office of foreign assets control or ofac and other international bodies have imposed sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are also subject to the fcpa and antibribery and anticorruption laws in other countries all of which prohibit companies and their intermediaries from bribing government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under us and other antibribery laws 

our compliance program contains controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac and other sanctions and laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of our compliance program may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of compliance issues or violations by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents including third parties we associate with or companies we acquire could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in us under certain state laws 

changes in privacy and data protection regulations could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance 

epam is subject to the gdpr and the ccpa each of which imposes significant restrictions and requirements relating to the processing of personal data these and other recent international data protection laws are more burdensome than historical privacy standards especially in the united states the ccpa and gdpr each established complex legal obligations that organizations must follow with respect to the processing of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information to third parties or to other countries and the imposition of additional notification security and other control measures 

enforcement actions taken by the european union data protection authorities in the case of gdpr or by individuals or the california regulatory authorities in the case of the ccpa as well as audits or investigations by one or more individuals organizations or foreign government agencies could result in penalties and fines for noncompliance or direct claims against us in the event of any loss or damage as a result of a breach of these regulations the burden of compliance with additional data protection requirements may result in significant additional costs complexity and risk in our services and customer may seek to shift the potential risks resulting from the implementation of data privacy legislation to us we are required to establish processes and change certain operations in relation to the processing of personal data as a result of gdpr and ccpa which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business 

complying with a wide variety of legal requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate can create risks to our operations and financial condition including liquidation of the subsidiaries that operate our major delivery centers 

our global operations require us to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions inflation unstable political and military situations labor issues and legal systems that make it more difficult to enforce intellectual property contractual or corporate rights certain legal provisions in russia belarus and ukraine where our local subsidiaries operate important delivery centers and employ a significant number of billable professionals may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if we fail to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of our local subsidiaries in court and creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims demand early performance of the company’s obligations and demand compensation for any damages involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in one or more jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including but not limited to a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our results of operations business and profitability in addition any significant changes to the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” enacted in 2017 or to regulatory guidance associated with the us tax act could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided to companies in our industry by the governments of belarus and other countries 

in belarus our local subsidiary along with other member technology companies of hightechnologies park have a full exemption from belarus income tax and value added tax until 2049 and are taxed at reduced rates on a variety of other taxes in russia our local subsidiary along with other qualified it companies benefit from paying obligatory social contributions to the government at a significantly reduced rate as well as an exemption from value added tax in certain circumstances if these tax benefits are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses could increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provision for income taxes” 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of some of our personnel or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

in several countries certain of our personnel are retained as independent contractors the criteria to determine whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary by jurisdiction as can the interpretation of the applicable laws if a government authority or court makes any adverse determination with respect to independent contractors in general or one or more of our independent contractors specifically we could incur significant costs including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and increase the difficulty in attracting and retaining personnel 

we may need additional capital and a failure to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions that we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another or larger credit facility and we cannot be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders and additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service costs and obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations 

our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

expense related to our liabilityclassified restricted stock units which are subject to marktomarket accounting and the calculation of the weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding in accordance with the treasury method are both affected by our stock price any fluctuations in the price of our stock will affect our future operating results 

our hedging program is subject to counterparty default risk 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with a number of counterparties as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults on its performance under the contract during an economic downturn the counterparty’s financial condition may deteriorate rapidly and with little notice and we may be unable to take action to protect our exposure in the event of a counterparty default we could incur significant losses which may harm our business and financial condition in the event that one or more of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to eventually recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty

the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2019 were as follows 

 the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report 

revenues — as discussed in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k on january 1 2018 we adopted the new accounting standard asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” topic 606 as amended using the modified retrospective method this resulted in different revenue recognition accounting policies applied to the years presented in our consolidated financial statements 

for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

we recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price variable consideration usually takes the form of volumebased discounts service level credits price concessions or incentives determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported 

we derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to customers by combining software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements we generate the majority of our revenues under timeandmaterial contracts which are billed using hourly daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the customer we apply a practical expedient and revenues related to timeandmaterial contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed 

fixedprice contracts include maintenance and support arrangements which may exceed one year in duration maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period fixedprice contracts also include application development arrangements where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period 

revenues from licenses which have significant standalone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer revenues from licenses which do not have standalone functionality are recognized over time if there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is one year or less 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

for the year ended december 31 2017 

we recognized revenue when the following criteria were met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed 2 delivery had occurred 3 the sales price was fixed or determinable and 4 collectability was reasonably assured determining whether and when some of these criteria had been satisfied often involved assumptions and judgments that could have had a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenues reported 

we derived our revenues from a variety of service offerings which represent specific competencies of our delivery professionals contracts for these services had different terms and conditions based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement which required management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition fees for these contracts may have been in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements if there was uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services revenue was deferred until the uncertainty was sufficiently resolved at the time revenue was recognized we provided for any contractual deductions and reduced revenue accordingly the company reported gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we deferred amounts billed to our customers for revenues not yet earned such amounts were anticipated to be recorded as revenues when services were performed in subsequent periods revenues were recorded when services had been provided but billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms 

the majority of our revenues 903 of revenues in 2017 were generated under timeandmaterial contracts whereby revenues were recognized as services were performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues the majority of such revenues were billed using hourly daily or monthly rates as actual time was incurred on the project revenues from fixedprice contracts 83 of revenues in 2017 included fixedprice maintenance and support arrangements which may have exceeded one year in duration and revenues from maintenance and support arrangements were generally recognized ratably over the expected service period fixedprice contracts also included application development arrangements and revenues from these arrangements were primarily determined using the proportional performance method in cases where final acceptance of the product system or solution was specified by the customer and the acceptance criteria were not objectively determinable to have been met as the services were provided revenues were deferred until all acceptance criteria had been met in the absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue was recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the customer assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could have affected the amount of revenues receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period 

business combinations  — we account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed the allocation of the purchase price utilizes significant estimates in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets the significant estimates and assumptions used include the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows anticipated growth rates client attrition rates the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and the determination of useful lives for finitelived assets there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain the acquired assets typically include customer relationships software trade names noncompetition agreements and assembled workforce and as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

if the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date revisions to the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings 

leases — we determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception we perform an assessment and classify the lease as either an operating lease or a financing lease at the lease commencement date with a rightofuse asset “rou asset” and a lease liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheet under both classifications 

lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid the present value is determined by applying the readily determinable rate implicit in the lease or if not available the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee we determine the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee on a leasebylease basis by developing an estimated centralized us dollar borrowing rate for a fully collateralized obligation with a term similar to the lease term and adjust the rate to reflect the incremental risk associated with the currency in which the lease is denominated the development of this estimate includes the use of recovery rates us riskfree rates foreign currencycountry base rate yields and a synthetic corporate credit rating of the company developed using regression analysis our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease we includes such options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option rou assets are recognized based on the initial measurement of the lease liabilities plus initial direct costs less lease incentives lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term rou assets are subject to periodic impairment tests 

we have elected a practical expedient to account for lease and nonlease components together as a single lease component in addition we elected the shortterm lease recognition exemption for all classes of lease assets

results of operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 





revenues 

we continue to expand our presence across multiple geographies and verticals both organically and through strategic acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2019  our total revenues grew 245 over the previous year to 23 billion  this growth resulted from our ability to retain existing customers and increase the level of services we provide to them and our ability to produce revenues from new customer relationships customer concentration continued to decrease with revenues from our top five top ten and top twenty clients declining as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the previous year revenue has been positively impacted from the acquisition of test io and other 2019 acquisitions which contributed 02 and 05  respectively to our revenue growth and negatively impacted by the fluctuations in foreign currency that decreased our revenue growth by 13 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the previous year 

we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical customer location service arrangement type and customer concentration 

revenues by vertical 

we assign our customers into one of our five main vertical markets or a group of various industries where we are increasing our presence which we label as “emerging verticals” emerging verticals include customers in multiple industries such as energy utilities manufacturing automotive telecommunications and several others 

the following table presents our revenues by vertical and revenues as a percentage of total revenues by vertical for the periods indicated 



revenues by customer location 

our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets north america europe cis and apac we present and discuss our revenues by customer location based on the location of the specific customer site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the customer or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed revenues by customer location is different from revenues by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report segments are not based on the geographic location of the customers but instead they are based on the location of the company’s management responsible for a particular customer or market 

the following table sets forth revenues by customer location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 





during the year ended december 31 2019  revenues in our largest geography north america were 13900 million growing 2908 million  or 265  from 10992 million reported for the year ended december 31 2018  revenues from this geography accounted for 606 of total revenues in 2019  an increase from 596 in the prior year the united states continued to be our largest customer location contributing revenues of 13217 million in 2019 compared to 10293 million in 2018 

revenues in our europe geography were 7469 million  an increase of 1344 million  or 219  over 6125 million in the previous year revenues in this geography accounted for 326 of consolidated revenues in 2019 as compared to 332 in the previous year the top three revenue contributing customer location countries in europe were the united kingdom switzerland and the netherlands generating revenues of 2900 million  1527 million and 885 million in 2019 respectively compared to 2009 million  1444 million and 703 million in 2018 respectively fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the us dollar particularly the euro and the british pound during 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year negatively impacted revenue growth in the european geography by 32 

during 2019 revenues in the cis geography increased 188 million  or 230  from the previous year the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers in russia contributing 188 million of revenue growth in 2019 compared to the previous year 

revenues from customers in locations in the apac region comprised 24 of total revenues in 2019  a level consistent with the prior year 

discussion of revenues from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in “part ii item 7 results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 

revenues by customer concentration 

we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers and we seek to grow revenues from our existing customers by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon completion of multiyear projects while we believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing customers we continue to focus on diversification of our customer concentration and building up a portfolio of new accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential we anticipate the contribution of these new accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid to longterm and offset the potential slower growth rate of some of our largest customers as those accounts mature 

we expect customer concentration from our top customers to continue to decrease over the longterm the following table presents revenues contributed by our customers by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

the following table shows the number of customers from which we earned revenues for each year presented 

revenues by service offering 

effective january 1 2018 the company adopted asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 as amended the adoption of this standard required various disaggregated levels of revenue to be disclosed as presented in note 9 “revenues” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k the standard also required us to consider how management views the business and provide the appropriate disclosures that would be relevant and informative under those views 

our service arrangements have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our customers where we combine software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services we are continually expanding our service capabilities moving beyond traditional services into business consulting design and physical product development as more of our projects involve multiple competencies and different types of specialized professionals working collaboratively it has been increasingly difficult to classify our projects into the specific service offerings that we historically presented given the market demand for integrated customer solutions and our management’s view of the business we changed our presentation of service offerings to better reflect our business model 

our professional services engagement models vary based on the type of services provided to a customer the mix and locations of delivery professionals involved and pricing type which is either timeandmaterial or fixedprice historically the majority of our professional services revenues have been generated under timeandmaterial contracts and we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the foreseeable future 

the following table shows revenues by service offering as an amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the years indicated 





 see note 9 “revenues” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our contract types and related revenue recognition policies 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation projectrelated travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to customer projects salaries and other compensation expenses of our delivery professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing customer services during a given period our employees are a critical asset necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs 

we manage the utilization levels of our delivery professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects some of these professionals are hired and trained to work for specific customers or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific customers or projects our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services 

during the year ended december 31 2019  cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 14882 million  representing an increase of 254 from 11869 million reported last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 192 growth in the average number of production headcount for the year and a higher level of accrued variable compensation in 2019 as compared to the prior year 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 649 and 644 during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects the impact from lower utilization rates and increased stock compensation expense 

discussion of cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business these expenses include the costs of salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation severance bad debt travel legal and accounting services insurance facilities including operating leases advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hightechnologies park we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but generally to remain steady as a percentage of our revenues in the foreseeable future 

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased due to our continuously expanding operations strategic business acquisitions and the hiring of necessary personnel to support our growth during the year ended december 31 2019  selling general and administrative expenses were 4574 million  representing an increase of 224 as compared to 3736 million reported last year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2019 was primarily driven by a 448 million increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense and talent acquisition and development expenses and a 280 million increase in facilities and infrastructure related expenses to support our growth 

expressed as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses decreased 04 to 199 for the year ended december 31 2019  the decrease was primarily driven by the slower growth of 197 in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense as compared to revenue growth of 245  

discussion of selling general and administrative expenses from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 

depreciation and amortization expense 

during the year ended december 31 2019  depreciation and amortization expense was 453 million  representing an increase of 87 million from 366 million reported last year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finitelived intangible assets expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent at 20 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018 

discussion of depreciation and amortization expense from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and employee housing loans gains and losses from certain financial instruments interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration there were no material changes in interest and other income net in 2019 as compared to 2018 and 2017 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment we consider factors that may contribute favorably or unfavorably to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future these factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items 

as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2019  2018 and 2017  we had 2342 million  2052 million and 1809 million  respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest and penalty expense tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

in belarus member technology companies of hightechnologies park including our local subsidiary have a full exemption from belarus income tax on qualifying income through january 2049 however beginning february 1 2018 the earnings of the company’s belarus local subsidiary became subject to us income taxation due to the company’s decision to change the tax status of the subsidiary consequently there was less income tax benefit from the belarus tax exemption during 2018 compared to the previous year there was no aggregate dollar benefit derived from this tax holiday for the year ended december 31 2019  and the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated 14 million and 155 million for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively there was no impact on diluted net income per share for the year ended december 31 2019  the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated 002 and 028 for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  respectively 

the provision for income taxes was 385 million in 2019 and 95 million in 2018  partially driven by the increase in pretax income year over year the effective tax rate increased from 38 in 2018 to 128 in 2019 primarily due to onetime benefits in 2018 partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits associated with equity award exercises and vesting which were 284 million in 2019 compared to 174 million in 2018 the provision for income taxes in 2018 included the following onetime net tax benefits 

 discussion of the provision for income taxes from 2018 as compared to 2017 is disclosed in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018

results by business segment 

our operations consist of three reportable segments north america europe and russia the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and segment operating profits segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses certain corporate expenses are not allocated to specific segments as these expenses are not controllable at the segment level such expenses include certain types of professional fees noncorporate taxes compensation to nonemployee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses including compensation of specific groups of nonproduction employees in addition the company does not allocate stockbased compensation expenses amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisitionrelated expenses these unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations 

we manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for the client base and market as managerial responsibility for a particular customer relationship generally correlates with the customer’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between customer locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some cases managerial responsibility for a particular customer is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between customer executives and particular members of epam’s senior management team in such cases the customer’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company changed its management reporting of segment revenues to exclude other income prior year amounts presented below have been changed to conform to that presentation 

segment revenues from external customers and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe and russia segments for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were as follows 



during the year ended december 31 2018 the company began to allocate certain staff recruitment and development expenses into segment operating profit as these expenses became part of the evaluation of segment management’s performance these costs were not previously allocated to segments and were included in unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated income before provision for income taxes the effect of this reclassification was not material to segment operating profit and had no impact on total income from operations for the year ended december 31 2018 

north america segment 

2019 compared to 2018 

during 2019 north america segment revenues increased 3040 million  or 282  over last year revenues from our north america segment represent 602 and 584 of total segment revenues during 2019 and 2018 respectively during 2019 as compared to 2018  the north america segment’s operating profits increased 719 million  or 324  to 2938 million  north america’s operating profit represented 213 of north america segment revenues as compared to 206 in 2018 

revenues were negatively impacted by the reassignment of a certain customer to the europe segment from the north america segment as a result of a change in managerial responsibility without this reassignment north america segment revenue growth would have been 346 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018  

the following table presents north america segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 

software  hitech remained the largest industry vertical in the north america segment during the year ended december 31 2019 growing 316 as compared to the prior year which was a result of the continued focus on working with our technology customers revenues from the financial services vertical grew in excess of 50 during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 revenues from the business information  media vertical grew 45 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the corresponding period from the prior year and were adversely impacted by the reassignment of a certain customer to the europe segment without this reassignment the business information  media vertical would have grown 318 during the year 2019 compared to the previous year 

2018 compared to 2017 

north america segment revenues increased 2809 million  or 353  over 2017 revenues from our north america segment represent 584 and 549 of total segment revenues during 2018 and 2017 respectively during 2018 as compared to 2017 the north america segment’s operating profits increased 525 million  or 310  to 2218 million  north america’s operating profit represented 206 of north america segment revenues as compared to 213 in 2017 

the following table presents north america segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 

software  hitech remained the largest industry vertical in the north america segment during the year ended december 31 2018 growing 273 as compared to the prior year which was a result of the continued focus on working with our technology customers revenues from the financial services and emerging verticals grew in excess of 50 during the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2017 substantially driven by customers we began serving in the prior 24 months 

europe segment 

our europe segment includes the business in the apac region which is managed by the same management team 

2019 compared to 2018 

during 2019 europe segment revenues were 8207 million  reflecting an increase of 1279 million  or 185  from last year revenues from our europe segment represent 358 and 376 of total segment revenues during 2019 and 2018  respectively during 2019  this segment’s operating profits decreased 10 million  or 09 as compared to last year to 1149 million  europe’s operating profit represented 140 of europe segment revenues as compared to 167 in 2018 

revenues benefited from the reassignment of a certain customer to the europe segment from the north america segment as a result of a change in managerial responsibility without this reassignment europe segment revenue growth would have been 86 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018 

the following table presents europe segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 

the europe segment benefited from strong growth in the business information  media vertical of 1165 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018 this is primarily due to the reassignment of a certain customer to the europe segment from the north america segment as a result of a change in managerial responsibility without this reassignment business information  media growth would have been 227 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2019 financial services remained the largest industry vertical in the europe segment however revenues in financial services decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to slower demand for our services by certain banks in europe revenues in software  hitech also decreased during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of 2018 primarily due to a change in the estimate of variable consideration associated with a single customer 

2018 compared to 2017 

europe segment revenues were  6928 million  reflecting an increase of 1013 million  or 171  from 2017 revenues from our europe segment represented 376 and 408 of total segment revenues during 2018 and 2017 respectively during 2018 this segment’s operating profits increased 238 million  or 258 as compared to 2017 to 1159 million  europe’s operating profit represented 167 of the europe segment revenues as compared to 156 in 2017 

the following table presents europe segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 

the europe segment benefited from strong growth in the travel  consumer vertical of 301 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 financial services remained the largest industry vertical in the europe segment revenues in financial services grew less than 10 as compared to 2017 primarily due to decreasing revenues from certain customers outside of our top 5 customers 

russia segment 

2019 compared to 2018 

during 2019 revenues from our russia segment increased 190 million relative to 2018 and represent 40 of total segment revenues during both 2019 and 2018  operating profits of our russia segment increased 60 million when compared to 2018  expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues the segment’s operating profits were 188 and 156 in 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the following table presents russia segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 

the depreciation of the russian ruble against the us dollar during 2019 as compared to 2018 unfavorably impacted revenues in this segment however segment operating profit as a percentage of revenues improved primarily due to realized gains on our foreign currency hedges currency fluctuations of the russian ruble typically impact the results in the russia segment ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and the volatility of the russian ruble can significantly impact reported revenues and profitability in this segment we continue to monitor geopolitical forces economic and trade sanctions and other issues involving this region 

2018 compared to 2017 

revenues from our russia segment increased 102 million relative to 2017 and represent 40 and 43 of total segment revenues during 2018 and 2017 respectively operating profits of our russia segment decreased 25 million when compared to 2017 expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues the segment’s operating profits were 156 and 221 in 2018 and 2017 respectively 

the depreciation of the russian ruble against the us dollar during 2018 as compared to 2017 significantly impacted the revenues in this segment which were not similarly offset with the costs due to realized losses on our foreign currency hedges 

effects of inflation 

economies in some countries where we operate particularly belarus russia kazakhstan ukraine and india have periodically experienced high rates of inflation periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business as of december 31 2019  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 9366 million and 2747 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we have cash in banks in belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan armenia and uzbekistan where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems in these countries generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured as of december 31 2019  the total amount of cash held in these countries was 2065 million and of this amount 1234 million was located in belarus 

as of december 31 2019  we had 2747 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and had outstanding debt of 250 million  as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all covenants specified under the credit facility and anticipate being in compliance for the foreseeable future see note 8 “longterm debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our longterm debt 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2019 decreased 48 million  or 16  to 2875 million  as compared to 2018 primarily driven by the payout of a higher level of variable compensation related to 2018 performance partially offset by the increase in net income additionally a larger improvement in days sales outstanding during 2018 compared to 2019 resulted in higher relative collections during 2018 as compared to 2019 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2019 was 1454 million compared to 1121 million used in the same period in 2018  during 2019  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of 617 million compared to the same period last year partially offset by a decrease in net cash used to acquire businesses of 349 million  

financing activities 

during the year ended december 31 2019  net cash provided by financing activities was 204 million  representing a 26 million decrease from 230 million cash provided by financing activities in 2018  the decrease was primarily driven by 78 million in higher payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units partially offset by a 35 million repayment of debt in 2018 and 22 million of higher cash received in 2019 from the exercises of stock options issued under our longterm incentive plans compared to 2018 

discussion of the comparison of the cash flows between 2018 and 2017 is disclosed in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  





as of december 31 2019  we had 29 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters in addition we had recorded 105 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2019 related to the acquisitions of businesses that are not included in the table above due to the uncertainty involved with the potential payments 

see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 for information regarding contractual obligations 

future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future however our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 14 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks primarily result from changes in concentration of credit risks interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash cash equivalents and trade receivables 

we maintain our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we have cash in banks in countries such as belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan armenia and uzbekistan where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured as of december 31 2019  2065 million of total cash was kept in banks in these countries of which 1234 million was held in belarus in this region and particularly in belarus a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the region which could adversely affect our business and financial condition cash in this region is used for shortterm operational needs and cash balances in those banks move with the needs of those entities 

trade receivables are generally dispersed across many customers operating in different industries therefore concentration of credit risk is limited and we do not believe significant credit risks existed at december 31 2019  though our results of operations depend on our ability to successfully collect payment from our customers for work performed historically credit losses and writeoffs of trade receivables have not been material to our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is influenced by the changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalent deposits and paid on any outstanding balance on our borrowings mainly under our 2017 credit facility which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the currency and timing of funds borrowed we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to these deposits and borrowings 

foreign exchange risk 

our global operations are conducted predominantly in us dollars other than us dollars we generate revenues principally in euros british pounds swiss francs canadian dollars and russian rubles other than us dollars we incur expenditures principally in russian rubles hungarian forints polish zlotys british pounds swiss francs euros indian rupees and chinese yuan renminbi as a result currency fluctuations specifically the depreciation of the euro british pound and canadian dollar and the appreciation of russian rubles hungarian forints polish zlotys indian rupees and chinese yuan renminbi relative to the us dollar could negatively impact our results of operations 

during the year ended december 31 2019  our foreign exchange loss was 120 million compared to a 05 million gain reported last year during the year ended december 31 2019  approximately 323 of consolidated revenues and 405 of operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

during 2018 we implemented a hedging program through which we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted russian ruble indian rupee and polish zloty transactions we entered into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated operating expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly they are not speculative in nature as of december 31 2019  the net unrealized gain from these hedges was 1667  

management supplements results reported in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles referred to as gaap with nongaap financial measures management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating its performance when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared on the basis of “constant currency” which is a nongaap financial measure this measure excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 

during the year ended december 31 2019  we reported revenue growth of 245  had our consolidated revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2018 we would have reported revenue growth of 258  during 2019 revenues have been negatively impacted by the depreciation of the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2019  we reported net income growth of 87 over the previous year had our consolidated results been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2018 we would have reported net income growth of 73  net income has been positively impacted by the depreciation of the hungarian forint polish zloty and russian ruble relative to the us dollar partially offset by the depreciation of the euro and british pound relative to the us dollar

 item 9a controls and procedures 

conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

based on management’s evaluation with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this report these officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting except as described below 

beginning january 1 2019 we adopted the new lease standard and implemented significant new lease accounting systems processes and internal controls over lease accounting to assist us in the application of the new lease standard 

during the year ended december 31 2019 the company acquired test io together with its subsidiary and made certain other business acquisitions as described more fully in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k as permitted by the securities and exchange commission management has elected to exclude these acquired entities from its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 the company began to integrate these acquired companies into its internal control over financial reporting structure subsequent to their respective acquisition dates and expects to complete these integrations in 2020 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2019 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management has excluded test io together with its subsidiary and other acquired businesses from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 since these entities were acquired in business combinations in 2019 these businesses are included in our 2019 consolidated financial statements and constituted 30 of total assets as of december 31 2019 and 10 of revenues for the year then ended 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears in “part iv item 15 exhibits financial statement schedule” of this annual report on form 10k 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

employees 

our employees are a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and serve our customers we have dedicated fulltime employees who oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including a professional talent acquisition team whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced it professionals within various epam locations it is critical that we effectively plan our shortterm and longterm recruitment needs and deploy the necessary personnel and processes to optimize utilization and quickly satisfy the demands of our customers as our business grows we also focus on hiring and retaining individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive finance legal hr and other key management positions

in our competitive industry the ability to hire and retain highlyskilled information technology professionals is critical to our success we believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our customers to attract retain and motivate our it professionals we offer a challenging work environment ongoing skills development initiatives attractive career advancement and promotion opportunities thus providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance 

we dedicate significant resources to the training continuing education and career development programs of our entrylevel and experienced it professionals we believe in the importance of supporting educational initiatives and we sponsor employees’ participation in internal and external training and certifications entrylevel it professionals undergo a rigorous training program that consists of approximately three to six months of classroom training as well as numerous hours of handson training through actual engagements this comprehensive program results in employees who are highly proficient and possess deep technical expertise that enables them to immediately serve our customers’ needs for our midlevel and senior it professionals we offer continuing education programs aimed at helping them advance in their careers we also provide mentoring opportunities management and soft skills training intensive workshops and management and technical advancement programs in order to support the development of middle and senior management through formal leadership training evaluation development and promotion

 we believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and our employees have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements other than broad industrywide agreements as required in certain countries in europe and mexico or engaged in any labor disputes 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as eastern europe india and china we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings reputation and track record for highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to customers’ business needs scale financial stability and price 

we face competition from various technology services providers such as accenture atos capgemini cognizant technology solutions deloitte digital dxc technology exlservice genpact globallogic globant hcl technologies hp enterprise ibm services infosys luxoft holding inc mindtree perficient tata consultancy services virtusa corporation and wipro among others additionally we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate 

we believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions our technical employee base and our development and continuous improvement in process methodologies applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future 

quality management and information security 

we are continuously investing in applications tools and infrastructure to manage all aspects of our global delivery process in order to manage quality and security risks while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our customers we maintain processes and infrastructure to protect our clients’ and their customers’ confidential and sensitive information and allocate resources to ensure information security cybersecurity and data privacy we have made significant investments in the appropriate people processes and technology to establish and manage compliance with confidentiality policies laws and regulations governing our activities such as the european union data protection legal framework referred to as the general data protection regulation “gdpr” among others

intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our customers we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us which assign to us all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential 

we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our customers these customary agreements cover our use of our customers’ software systems and platforms as our customers usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them furthermore we usually grant a perpetual worldwide royaltyfree nonexclusive transferable and nonrevocable license to our customers to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them 

regulations 

due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations several foreign and us federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business see “item 1a risk factors — risks relating to our business — we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anticorruption laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures”

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock listed below not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence are the most significant risk factors applicable to us additionally forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks relating to our business 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources 

we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business over the past several years both organically and through strategic acquisitions our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure continued expansion increases the challenges we face in 

 moreover we intend to continue our expansion for the foreseeable future and pursue available opportunities as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological operational compliance and administrative risks and challenges as a result of these and other challenges associated with expansion we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth and our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to successfully attract hire train and retain new personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future customers could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to those customers 

the ability to hire and retain highly skilled information technology professionals including project managers it engineers and other technical personnel is critical to our success to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business we must attract hire train and retain personnel with diverse skill sets and competencies including those with management experience across the geographically diverse locations in which we operate competition for highly skilled professionals is intense in the markets where we operate and we may experience significant employee turnover rates due to such competition if we are unable to attract hire train or retain highly skilled personnel our ability to meet and develop ongoing and future business could be jeopardized and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 a significant increase in the attrition rate among professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services in addition any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire personnel to meet our business requirements may suffer 

increases in wages for our people and other compensation expense could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wage costs for industry professionals in the emerging markets in which we have significant operations and delivery centers are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the service industry in these countries may increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our people wage inflation may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability 

additionally we have granted certain equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and entered into other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past and expect to continue this practice the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness to us of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the value of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations furthermore any new regulations volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish our use and the value of our equitybased awards this could put us at a competitive disadvantage or cause us to consider changes to our pay structure the issuance of equitybased compensation also results in additional dilution to our stockholders 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted if any of our senior executives or key personnel such as business development managers joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose customers suppliers knowhow and key personnel to them 

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization and productivity levels 

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization and productivity levels of fixedcost resources such as our professionals as well as other resources such as computers and office space our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming professionals to plan effectively for future needs to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any customer or on any project for which we have dedicated personnel or facilities we may not be able to reallocate these assets to other customers and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks 

we are a global company with substantial international operations the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks 

risks inherent in conducting international operations include 

 our global operations are conducted predominantly in us dollars however we generate a significant portion of our revenues and incur expenditures in various currencies other than us dollars the majority of our customers are in north america and western europe while most of our personnel and delivery centers are located in lower cost locations these factors expose us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues compensation purchases capital expenditures receivables and other balancesheet items as we continue to leverage our global delivery model a larger portion of our revenues and incurred expenses may be in currency other than us dollars in some countries we may be subject to regulatory or practical restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies which would limit our ability to use cash across our global operations and increase our exposure to currency fluctuations this risk could increase as we continue expanding our global operations which may include entering emerging markets that may be more likely to impose these types of restrictions currency exchange volatility caused by political or economic instability or other factors could also materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

our industry is sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our customers may reduce or postpone their technology related spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate our customers and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which we operate regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease such events may cause customers to delay their decisions on spending for the services we provide and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our customers which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our customers travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled personnel we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks 

we have significant operations in certain emerging market economies in eastern europe india and other asian countries emerging markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including those that may result from foreign laws and regulations the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions tax increases fluctuations in exchange rates inflation unstable political and military situations labor issues and less established legal systems the economies of certain countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns such economic instability and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations may be adversely affected by ongoing conflict in ukraine 

continuing military activities in ukraine have combined with ukraine’s weak economic conditions to fuel ongoing economic uncertainty in ukraine russia and other markets the european union united states and other nations have imposed and may continue imposing further economic sanctions including specific sanctions on certain russian entities specifically in the energy defense and financial sectors prolonged political instability in ukraine sanctions against russia and russia’s potential response to such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our operations we have delivery centers in ukraine employing 5836  billable professionals as of december 31 2018 none of which is located in the most volatile regions of eastern ukraine we also have delivery centers in russia employing 4438  billable professionals as of december 31 2018 located in various cities including moscow and st petersburg to date we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our customers we continue to monitor the situation closely our contingency plans include relocating work andor personnel to other locations and adding new locations as appropriate 

the us congress and trump administration may make substantial changes to fiscal political regulatory and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business and financial results 

changes in general economic or political conditions in the united states or other regions could adversely affect our business for example the administration under president donald trump has put forth and may continue to propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues including international trade agreements import and export regulations tariffs and customs duties foreign relations immigration laws and corporate governance laws that could have a positive or negative impact on our business 

we do not have longterm commitments from our customers and our customers may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts a loss of business from significant customers could materially affect our results of operations 

our ability to maintain continuing relationships with our major customers is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific customer is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our customers’ exclusive it services provider and we generally do not have longterm commitments from customers to purchase our services the ability of our customers to terminate engagements with or without cause makes our future revenues uncertain although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from customers who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our customers are typically for projects that are singular in nature therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end 

there are a number of factors relating to our customers that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including 

 termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and thus compress our margins until we are able to reallocate our headcount the loss of any of our major customers or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them if not replaced by new service engagements could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our customers is concentrated in five specific industry verticals financial services software  hitech business information  media travel  consumer and life sciences  healthcare our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from customers in these five industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource the type of services we provide 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes decreased demand for our services or increased pricing pressure on us from our customers in these key industries could adversely affect our results of operations 

furthermore developments in the industries we serve and our expansion into new industries could shift customer demand to new services solutions or technology if our customers demand new services solutions or technologies we may be less competitive in these new areas or may need to make significant investments to meet that demand additionally as we expand into serving new verticals our solutions and technology may be used by or generally affect a broader base of customers and end users which may expose us to new business and operational risks 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts and setting terms with our customers our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts assumptions and predictions about our projects the marketplace global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility and the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated longterm cost savings that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract because of these inherent uncertainties we may underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we are not able to pass on to our customers increases in compensation costs whether driven by competition for talent or ordinarycourse pay increases or charge premium prices when justified by market demand or the type of service our profitability may suffer 

in addition a number of our contracts contain conditions in pricing terms that are dependent on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules our failure to meet these specified conditions or our failure to meet customer expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements 

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

to successfully perform larger and more complex projects we need to establish and maintain effective close relationships with our customers continue high levels of customer satisfaction and develop a thorough understanding of our customers’ operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including 

 our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our professionals in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a customer may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements failure to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business compress our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our services before potential customers commit to use our services they require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our customers’ decision to select another service provider or inhouse resources to perform the services and the timing of our customers’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth in certain cases we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other evidence that the parties to the agreement have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements may cause fluctuations in recognized revenues between periods 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our customers and us our current and future customers may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential customers to whom we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services processes could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our customers our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our customers of the amounts they owe us for work performed there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers if our customers suffer financial difficulties it could cause them to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of customer balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of or inability to collect accounts receivable and in such cases our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we face intense and increasing competition for customers and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services and other consulting companies if we are unable to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the market for our services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations customers tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues to the extent that customers obtain services from competing companies customers may prefer services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate 

current or prospective customers may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore service providers which could seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our customers operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources therefore we may be unable to retain our customers while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could have a material adverse effect on our business customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers with less emphasis on quality 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose customers and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in our industry enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing customer needs the process of developing our customer solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with anticipate or respond to these changes is subject to a number of risks including that 

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of business or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect or correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current customers and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of customer data a failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our customers and us errors will not be found in new software product development solutions any such errors could result in litigation other claims for damages against us as well as reputational harm and thus could materially adversely affect our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we have access to collect store process and transmit sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks physical security and the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen such a breach or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by these events any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under applicable laws and regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

we may be liable to our customers for damages caused by the disclosure of confidential information system failures or errors 

 if any person including any of our personnel misappropriates sensitive or confidential customer information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our customers or from our customers’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws some of our customer agreements do not limit our potential liability for certain types of occurrences including breaches of confidentiality and infringement indemnity furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief any such breach or misappropriation resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers 

if we cause disruptions to our customers’ businesses or provide inadequate service our customers may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose customers have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

if our billable professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our customers or fail to consistently meet the service requirements of a customer these errors or failures could disrupt the customer’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us and could also result in a customer terminating our engagement any failure in a customer’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the customer could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure the assertion of one or more large claims against us whether or not successful could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant failure in our systems telecommunications or it infrastructure could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenues and otherwise disrupt our business 

our service model relies on maintaining active voice and data communications online resource management financial and operational record management customer service and data processing systems between our client sites our delivery centers and our customer management locations our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these technologies which could be due to software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrades damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete customer projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenues or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

our ability to generate and retain business could depend on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to customers and prospective customers based on a number of factors since many of our specific customer engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our customers’ evaluation of whether to engage our services and our customers’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former customers and employees competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if untrue could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be challenging to repair could make potential or existing customers reluctant to select us for new engagements and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

we may invest substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

to support the continued growth of our business we may invest in new facilities and physical infrastructure we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies do not perform to our expectations our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

part of our expansion strategy includes strategic acquisitions these transactions involve significant challenges including the risk that an acquisition does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve a satisfactory return on our investment that we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company’s employees customer relationships and operations and that the transactions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and making it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties 

the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including but not limited to a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business in addition any significant changes to the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” enacted in 2017 or to regulatory guidance associated with the us tax act could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided to companies in our industry by the governments of belarus and other countries 

in belarus our local subsidiary along with other member technology companies of hightechnologies park have a full exemption from belarus income tax and value added tax until 2049 and are taxed at reduced rates on a variety of other taxes in russia our local subsidiary along with other qualified it companies benefit from paying obligatory social contributions to the government at a significantly reduced rate as well as an exemption from value added tax in certain circumstances if these tax benefits are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — provision for income taxes” 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of some of our personnel or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

in several countries certain of our personnel are retained as independent contractors the criteria to determine whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary by jurisdiction as can the interpretation of the applicable laws if a government authority or court makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses 

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources 

most of the agreements we have entered into with our customers require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate 

the banking and financial systems in less developed markets where we hold funds remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have cash in banks in countries such as belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan and armenia where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured a banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in that region which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our customers we could be subject to legal liability if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability as a result we might face significant legal liability and payment obligations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected furthermore as we expand our business through strategic acquisitions and organically our new and existing contracts with customers may contain terms that do not fully protect us against new risks which may increase our potential exposure to losses 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as in the united states or other countries with more mature legal systems 

when personnel start with epam we require our employees and independent contractors to enter into written agreements which assign to epam all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or engagement with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential these agreements may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions in which we operate and we cannot ensure that we would be successful in defending a challenge by our current or former employees or independent contractors to such agreements we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our customers and certain vendors however these agreements may not fully protect our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our customers’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our customers’ technologies tools and applications without paying them for doing so and our customers may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks 

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties 

we typically indemnify customers who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property that such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our customers may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms in addition we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies 

parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our customers against infringement claims in certain instances any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anticorruption laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

as a company with international operations we are subject to many laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and antibribery and anticorruption laws in other countries we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under us and other antibribery laws 

we have a compliance program with controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and other sanctions laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of the program may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws 

changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance 

epam is subject to the european gdpr which imposes significant restrictions and requirements relating to the processing of personal data that are more burdensome than current privacy standards in the united states gdpr establishes complex legal obligations that organizations must follow with respect to the processing of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the european union to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security and the imposition of additional notification security and other control measures 

our customers and we are at risk of enforcement actions taken by the european union data protection authorities and we may face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations which could result in penalties and fines for noncompliance moreover individuals or organizations can make direct claims against us in the event of any loss or damage as a result of a breach of these regulations 

some customers are seeking additional assurances from us about our processing of personal data provided or made available by our customers to us in the course of our business the burden of compliance with additional customer requirements may result in significant additional cost complexity and risk in our services we may experience changes in customer behaviors due to the potential risks resulting from the implementation of gdpr we are required to establish processes and change certain operations in relation to the processing of personal data as a result of gdpr which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business 

antioutsourcing legislation and restrictions on immigration if adopted may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to customers in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the majority of our professionals are offshore some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our customers’ facilities which may require our personnel to obtain work authorizations to travel and work at client sites outside of our personnel’s home countries the ability of our employees to work in necessary locations around the world depends on their ability to obtain the required visas and work permits and this process can be lengthy and difficult immigration laws are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions moreover delays in the process to obtain visas may result in delays in the ability of our personnel to travel to meet with our customers provide services to our customers or to continue to provide services on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues it is possible that pending legislation in the united states regarding offshore outsourcing may impose restrictions on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to customer locations which could adversely impact our business if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain work visas 

our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our customers on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

our subsidiaries in belarus russia and ukraine can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements 

we operate in belarus russia and ukraine primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of the other countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if the company fails to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation for any damages if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility and we cannot be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders and additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 

our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

our liabilityclassified restricted stock units which are subject to marktomarket accounting and the calculation of weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding in accordance with the treasury method are both affected by our stock price any fluctuations in the price of our stock will affect our future operating results

overview of 2018  and financial highlights 

the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2018  were as follows 

 the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report 

revenues  — as discussed in note 1  “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we adopted the new accounting standard asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” topic 606 as amended using the modified retrospective method this resulted in different revenue recognition accounting policies applied to the years presented in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2018 

we recognize revenues when control of goods or services is passed to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services such control may be transferred over time or at a point in time depending on satisfaction of obligations stipulated by the contract consideration expected to be received may consist of both fixed and variable components and is allocated to each separately identifiable performance obligation based on the performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price variable consideration usually takes the form of volumebased discounts service level credits price concessions or incentives determining the estimated amount of such variable consideration involves assumptions and judgment that can have an impact on the amount of revenues reported 

we derive revenues from a variety of service arrangements which have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to customers by combining software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements we generate the majority of our revenues under timeandmaterial contracts which are billed using hourly daily or monthly rates to determine the amounts to be charged directly to the customer we apply a practical expedient and revenues related to timeandmaterial contracts are recognized based on the right to invoice for services performed 

fixedprice contracts include maintenance and support arrangements which may exceed one year in duration maintenance and support arrangements generally relate to the provision of ongoing services and revenues for such contracts are recognized ratably over the expected service period fixedprice contracts also include application development arrangements where progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured using input or output methods and input methods are used only when there is a direct correlation between hours incurred and the end product delivered assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used to measure progress could affect the amount of revenues receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period 

 revenues from licenses which have significant standalone functionality are recognized at a point in time when control of the license is transferred to the customer revenues from licenses which do not have standalone functionality are recognized over time 

if there is an uncertainty about the receipt of payment for the services revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we apply a practical expedient and do not assess the existence of a significant financing component if the period between transfer of the service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is one year or less 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 

we recognized revenue when the following criteria were met 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed 2 delivery had occurred 3 the sales price was fixed or determinable and 4 collectability was reasonably assured determining whether and when some of these criteria had been satisfied often involved assumptions and judgments that could have had a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenues reported 

we derived our revenues from a variety of service offerings which represent specific competencies of our it professionals contracts for these services had different terms and conditions based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement which required management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition fees for these contracts may have been in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements if there was uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services revenue was deferred until the uncertainty was sufficiently resolved at the time revenue was recognized we provided for any contractual deductions and reduced revenue accordingly the company reported gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

we deferred amounts billed to our customers for revenues not yet earned such amounts were anticipated to be recorded as revenues when services were performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues was recorded when services had been provided but billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms 

the majority of our revenues 903 of revenues in 2017 and 882 in 2016 were generated under timeandmaterial contracts whereby revenues were recognized as services were performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues the majority of such revenues were billed using hourly daily or monthly rates as actual time was incurred on the project revenues from fixedprice contracts 83 of revenues in 2017 and 104 in 2016 included fixedprice maintenance and support arrangements which may have exceeded one year in duration and revenues from maintenance and support arrangements were generally recognized ratably over the expected service period fixedprice contracts also included application development arrangements and revenues from these arrangements were primarily determined using the proportional performance method in cases where final acceptance of the product system or solution was specified by the customer and the acceptance criteria were not objectively determinable to have been met as the services were provided revenues were deferred until all acceptance criteria had been met in the absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue was recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the customer assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could have affected the amount of revenues receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period 

business combinations — we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805 “business combinations” we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain the acquired assets typically include customer relationships trade names noncompetition agreements and assembled workforce and as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

if the initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings 

goodwill and other intangible assets — we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october 31 and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value when conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment we use a twostep process the first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances in performing this assessment we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business industry and market trends as well as the overall future financial performance of a reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment we perform a second step consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment this quantitative assessment requires us to estimate impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

historically a significant portion of the purchase consideration related to our acquisitions was allocated to customer relationships in valuing customer relationships we typically utilize the multiperiod excess earnings method a form of the income approach the principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the aftertax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset only we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives on a straightline basis or if reliably determinable the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected discounted future cash flows amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives that predominantly range from five to ten years we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 

we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified in assessing fair value we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges if the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 

accounting for income taxes — we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes we estimate separately our deferred tax assets related valuation allowances current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the us internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes 

the realizability of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized a reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the us tax act which subjects a us shareholder to taxes on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” earned by certain foreign subsidiaries the fasb staff qa topic 740 no 5 “accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income” states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred during the year ended december 31 2018 we elected to provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred this election did not have a material impact on the financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 

stockbased compensation  — we recognize the cost of equitysettled stockbased incentive awards based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant net of estimated forfeitures the cost is expensed evenly over the service period the service period is the period over which the employee performs the related services which is normally the same as the vesting period quarterly the forfeiture assumption is adjusted and such adjustment may affect the timing of expense of the total amount recognized over the vesting period 

 adjusting stockbased compensation expense for estimated forfeitures requires judgment if we change our assumptions stockbased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past stockbased compensation expense in a period could be impacted favorably or unfavorably by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unvested stockbased compensation expense 

equitybased awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the end of each reporting period future stockbased compensation expense related to our liabilityclassified awards may increase or decrease as a result of changes in the market price for our stock adding to the volatility in our operating results 

our adoption of asu 201609 “compensation — stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” effective january 1 2017 increased income tax expense volatility our future operating results will be impacted by fluctuations in the stock price on the dates the awards vest or options are exercised and the magnitude of transactions occurring in each reporting period among other factors 

effective january 1 2018 we changed the methodology for estimating the volatility input used in the blackscholes option valuation model prior to january 1 2018 we estimated the volatility of our common stock by using the historical volatility of peer public companies including the company’s historical volatility in the first quarter of 2018 we began exclusively using our own historical volatility as we believe this is a more accurate estimate of future volatility of the price of epam’s common stock we did not change the methodology for estimating any other blackscholes option valuation model assumptions as disclosed in note 12  “stockbased compensation” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k

revenues 

we continue to expand our presence in multiple geographies and verticals both organically and through strategic acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2018  our total revenues grew 271  over the previous year to 18 billion  this growth resulted from our ability to retain existing customers and increase the level of services we provide to them and our ability to produce revenues from new customer relationships customer concentration continued to decrease with revenues from our top five top ten and top twenty clients declining as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the previous year revenue has been positively impacted from the acquisition of continuum innovation llc and think limited which contributed 18  and 01  respectively to our revenue growth and by the fluctuations in foreign currency that increased our revenue growth by 02  during the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the previous year 

we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by vertical customer location service arrangement type and customer concentration 

revenues by vertical 

our customers operate in five main industry verticals as well as in a number of verticals in which we are increasing our presence and label them as emerging verticals emerging verticals include customers in other industries such as energy utilities manufacturing auto telecommunications and several others 

 the following table presents our revenues by vertical and each vertical’s revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 



revenues by customer location 

our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets north america europe cis and apac we present and discuss our revenues by customer location based on the location of the specific customer site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the customer or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed revenues by customer location is different from revenues by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report segments are not based on the geographic location of the customers but instead they are based on the location of the company’s management responsible for a particular customer or market 

the following table sets forth revenues by customer location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 





2018  compared to 2017   

during the year ended december 31 2018  revenues in our largest geography north america were 10992 million  growing 2585 million  or 307  from 8407 million  reported for the year ended december 31 2017  revenues from this geography accounted for 596  of total revenues in 2018  an increase from 580 in the prior year the united states continued to be our largest customer location contributing revenues of 10293 million  in 2018 compared to 7836 million  in 2017 

revenues in our europe geography were 6125 million  an increase of 1012 million  or 198  over 5113 million  in the previous year revenues in this geography accounted for 332  of consolidated revenues in 2018  as compared to 352  in the previous year the top three revenue contributing customer location countries in europe were the united kingdom switzerland and germany generating revenues of 2009 million  1444 million  and 808 million  in 2018 respectively compared to 1890 million  1233 million  and 602 million  in 2017 respectively revenues in the european geography were positively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the us dollar particularly the euro and the british pound during 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year 

during 2018 revenues in the cis geography increased 133 million  or 195  from the previous year the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers in russia contributing 100 million  of revenue growth in 2018 compared to the previous year the revenues in the cis geography were negatively affected by currency fluctuations primarily russian rubles decreasing yearoveryear growth of reported revenues in this geography by 97 in 2018 

revenues from customers in locations in the apac region comprised 28  of total revenues in 2018  a level consistent with the prior year 

2017  compared to 2016   

during the year ended december 31 2017 revenues in our largest geography north america were 8407 million growing 1701 million or 254 from 6706 million reported for the year ended december 31 2016 revenues from this geography accounted for 580 of total revenues in 2017 a level consistent with the prior year 

within north america we experienced strong growth across all verticals with the business information  media vertical contributing 317 of total growth in the north america geography in addition our traditionally strong software  hitech portfolio grew 196 year over year we saw continued growth in emerging verticals with 442 growth in revenues with 297 of the growth coming from customers who have been with us less than one year 

revenues in our europe geography were 5113 million an increase of 935 million or 224 over 4178 million in the prior year revenues in this geography accounted for 352 of consolidated revenues in 2017 as compared to 360 in the prior year europe experienced strong growth in the business information  media life sciences  healthcare and emerging verticals each of which grew over 55 during 2017 over 70 of the growth in our europe geography in 2017 came from customers who have been with us less than two years financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography accounting for 411 of the europe geography’s revenues in 2017 as compared to 477 in 2016 

revenues in the cis geography increased 223 million or 483 from last year the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and emerging verticals revenues in this geography benefited by 59 million from the appreciation of the russian ruble relative to the us dollar 

revenues by customer concentration 

we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers and we seek to grow revenues from our existing customers by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon completion of multiyear projects while we believe there is a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within existing customers we continue to focus on diversification of our customer concentration and building up a portfolio of new accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential we anticipate the contribution of these new accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid to longterm and offset the potential slower growth rate of some of our largest customers as those accounts mature 

we expect customer concentration from our top customers to continue to decrease over the longterm the following table presents revenues contributed by our customers by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 



 the following table shows the number of customers from which we earned revenues for each year presented 

revenues by service offering 

effective january 1 2018 the company adopted asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  as amended the adoption of this standard required various disaggregated levels of revenue to be disclosed as presented in note 9  “revenues” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k the standard also required us to consider how management views the business and provide the appropriate disclosures that would be relevant and informative under those views 

our service arrangements have been evolving to provide more customized and integrated solutions to our customers where we combine software engineering with customer experience design business consulting and technology innovation services we are continually expanding our service capabilities moving beyond traditional services into business consulting design and physical product development as more of our projects involve multiple competencies and different types of specialized professionals working collaboratively it has been increasingly difficult to classify our projects into the specific service offerings that we historically presented given the market demand for integrated customer solutions and our management’s view of the business we changed our presentation of service offerings to better reflect our business model 

our professional services engagement models vary based on the type of services provided to a customer the mix and locations of professionals involved and pricing type which is either timeandmaterial or fixedprice historically the majority of our professional services revenues have been generated under timeandmaterial contracts and we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future 

the following table shows revenues by service offering as an amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the years indicated   





 see note 9  “revenues” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding our contract types and related revenue recognition policies 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation expense projectrelated travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to customer projects salaries and other compensation expenses of our revenue generating professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing customer services during a given period our employees are a critical asset necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs 

we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects some of our it professionals are hired and trained to work for specific customers or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific customers or projects our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our customers and their business decisions regarding the use of our services 

2018 compared to 2017 

during the year ended december 31 2018  cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 11869 million  representing an increase of 288  from 9214 million  reported last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of an 181  growth in the average number of production headcount for the year and a higher level of accrued variable compensation 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 644  and 635  during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects a higher level of accrued variable compensation based on the stronger relative performance in 2018 the impact from lower utilization rates and increased stock compensation expense 

2017 compared to 2016 

during the year ended december 31 2017 cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 9214 million representing an increase of 250 from 7372 million reported last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 150 growth in the average number of production headcount for the year as well as a 23 impact from appreciation of foreign currencies 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 635 and 636 during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively our utilization in 2017 improved by 38 as compared to 2016 which was offset by higher compensation expense and the unfavorable impact of appreciation of the russian ruble hungarian forint and polish zloty as compared to the us dollar 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general and administrative functions of our business these expenses include the costs of salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation expense severance travel legal and audit services insurance operating leases including lease exit costs advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hightechnologies park we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but generally to remain steady as a percentage of our revenues in the foreseeable future 

2018 compared to 2017 

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased due to our continuously expanding operations strategic business acquisitions and the hiring of necessary personnel to support our growth during the year ended december 31 2018  selling general and administrative expenses were 3736 million  representing an increase of 140  as compared to 3276 million  reported last year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2018  was primarily driven by a 274 million  increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense and talent acquisition and development expenses and a 160 million  increase in facilities and infrastructure related expenses to support our growth 

expressed as a percentage of revenues selling general and administrative expenses decreased 23  to 203  for the year ended december 31 2018  the decrease was primarily driven by the slower growth of 137 in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense as compared to revenue growth of 271  

2017 compared to 2016 

as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth our selling general and administrative expenses have been increasing during the year ended december 31 2017 selling general and administrative expenses were 3276 million  representing an increase of 232  as compared to 2659 million  reported in the prior year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2017 was driven by a 346 million  increase in personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense and talent acquisition and development expenses and a 166 million increase in facility and infrastructure expenses to support the increased headcount 

expressed as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased 03  to 226  for the year ended december 31 2017 

depreciation and amortization expense 

2018 compared to 2017 

during the year ended december 31 2018  depreciation and amortization expense was 366 million  representing an increase of 81 million  from 286 million  reported last year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finitelived intangible assets expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent during the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to 2017 

2017 compared to 2016 

during the year ended december 31 2017 depreciation and amortization expense was 286 million representing an increase of 52 million from 234 million reported last year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finitelived intangible assets expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net includes interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and employee housing loans gains and losses from certain financial instruments interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration there were no material changes in interest and other income net in 2018 as compared to 2017 and 2016 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and any potential related valuation allowances involves judgment we consider factors that may contribute favorably or unfavorably to the overall annual effective tax rate in the current year as well as the future these factors include statutory tax rates and tax law changes in the countries where we operate and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards as well as consideration of any significant or unusual items 

as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2018  2017  and 2016  we had 2052 million  1809 million  and 1358 million  respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest and penalty expense tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

in belarus member technology companies of hightechnologies park including our subsidiary have a full exemption from belarus income tax through january 2049 however beginning february 1 2018 the earnings of the company’s belarus local subsidiary are subject to u s income taxation due to the company’s decision to change the tax status of the subsidiary consequently there was less income tax benefit from the belarus tax exemption for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to previous years the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated 14 million 155 million  and 136 million  for the years ended december 31 2018 2017  and 2016  respectively the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated 002 028  and 026  for the years ended december 31 2018 2017  and 2016  respectively 

2018 compared to 2017 

the provision for income taxes was 95 million  in 2018  and 1015 million  in 2017  the decrease in the effective tax rate from 583  in 2017  to 38  in 2018  was primarily due to a provisional onetime 746 million charge in 2017 as a result of the us tax act and 300 million in onetime benefits in 2018 primarily resulting from our decision to change the tax status and to classify most of our foreign subsidiaries as disregarded for us income tax purposes as well as adjustments to the 2017 provisional charge 

the us tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 this rate reduction yielded lower taxes on us earnings in 2018 but was offset by us tax imposed on foreign subsidiary earnings due to our decision to file entity classification elections with the internal revenue service for the majority of our foreign subsidiaries to change the tax status and to classify most of our foreign subsidiaries as disregarded for us income tax purposes this change subjects the income of the disregarded foreign subsidiaries to us income taxation and reduces the impact of new taxes under the us tax act on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain related party payments which are referred to as gilti and the base erosion and antiabuse tax “beat” respectively a onetime tax benefit of 260 million was recorded to reflect the establishment of net deferred tax assets as a result of the entity classification elections 

the onetime 746 million charge in 2017 was comprised of a 643 million  provisional charge due to a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax as well as a 103 million  provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the us statutory tax rate from 350 to 210 in the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized as a result of the us tax act the provisional charge due to the onetime transition tax was reduced in 2018 to a final charge of 594 million this tax reduction resulted in a 49 million tax benefit in 2018 the provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the us statutory tax rate on the valuation of the net deferred tax assets was increased to a final charge of 112 million which resulted in a 09 million tax charge in 2018 

in 2017 we reassessed our accumulated foreign earnings in light of the us tax act and determined 970 million of our accumulated earnings in belarus were no longer indefinitely reinvested as a result we recorded a charge of 49 million in the provision for income taxes during the year ended december 31 2017 for the withholding tax payable to belarus when the earnings are distributed based on proposed tax regulations issued by the us treasury department during 2018 it was determined that a us foreign tax credit could be claimed for the withholding tax paid to belarus resulting in a net 49 million tax benefit recognized in 2018 this 49 million tax charge in 2017 and offsetting benefit in 2018 also contributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 

excess tax benefits associated with equity award exercises and vesting were 174 million  in 2018 and 93 million in 2017 due to the entity classification elections for us tax purposes the benefit from the equity awards to employees outside the us contributed to the increase in excess tax benefits for 2018 and also contributed to the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 

2017 compared to 2016 

the provision for income taxes was 1015 million in 2017 and 272 million in 2016 the increase in the effective tax rate from 215 in 2016 to 583 in 2017 was primarily due to the provisional 746 million charge as a result of the us tax act the us tax act significantly changed us corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 and the creation of a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax in addition the us tax act created new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain related party payments which are referred to as the global intangible lowtaxed income tax and the base erosion tax respectively the charge was comprised of a 643 million provisional charge due to the onetime transition tax as well as a 103 million provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the us statutory tax rate from 350 to 210 in the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized as a result of the us tax act 

in 2017 we also reassessed our accumulated foreign earnings in light of the us tax act and determined 970 million of our accumulated earnings in belarus are no longer indefinitely reinvested as a result we recorded a charge of 49 million in the provision for income taxes during the year ended december 31 2017 for the withholding tax payable to belarus when the earnings are distributed 

these charges were partially offset by the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017 whereby excess tax benefits of 93 million were recognized for the year ended december 31 2017 in the income tax provision rather than additional paidincapital 

other factors impacting our effective tax rate include changes in the geographic mix of our earnings attributable to foreign operations toward jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates as well as small decreases in statutory tax rates in hungary ukraine and the united kingdom

results by business segment 

our operations consist of three reportable segments north america europe and russia the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses such expenses include certain types of professional fees noncorporate taxes compensation to nonemployee directors and certain other general and administrative expenses including compensation of specific groups of nonproduction employees in addition the company does not allocate amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets goodwill and other asset impairment charges stockbased compensation expenses acquisitionrelated costs and certain other onetime charges these unallocated amounts are combined with total segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated income from operations 

we manage our business primarily based on the managerial responsibility for its client base and market as managerial responsibility for a particular customer relationship generally correlates with the customer’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between customer locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some cases managerial responsibility for a particular customer is assigned to a management team in another region and is usually based on the strength of the relationship between customer executives and particular members of epam’s senior management team in such cases the customer’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment 

segment revenues from external customers and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe and russia segments for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



during the year ended december 31 2018 the company began to allocate certain staff recruitment and development expenses into segment operating profit as these expenses became part of the evaluation of segment management’s performance these costs were previously not allocated to segments and were included in unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated income before provision for income taxes the effect of this reclassification was not material to segment operating profit and had no  impact on total income from operations for the year ended december 31 2018

2018  compared to 2017 

during 2018 revenues from our russia segment increased 102 million relative to 2017  and represent 40  and 43  of total segment revenues during 2018 and 2017  respectively 

the following table presents russia segment revenues by industry vertical for the periods indicated 

operating profits of our russia segment decreased 25 million  when compared to 2017  expressed as a percentage of russia segment revenues the segment’s operating profits were 156  and 221  in 2018 and 2017 respectively the depreciation of the russian ruble against the us dollar during 2018 as compared to 2017 significantly impacted the revenues in this segment which were not similarly offset with the costs due to realized losses on our foreign currency hedges currency fluctuations of the russian ruble typically impact the results in the russia segment ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and the volatility of the russian ruble can significantly impact reported revenues in this geography we continue to monitor geopolitical forces economic and trade sanctions and other issues involving this region 

     2017  compared to 2016 

revenues from our russia segment increased 194 million relative to 2016 operating profits of our russia segment increased 64 million when compared to 2016 expressed as a percentage of revenues the russia segment’s operating profits were 221 and 173 in 2017 and 2016 respectively this growth is partially attributable to the strengthening of the russian ruble against the us dollar during 2017 as compared to 2016 ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in this region as well as significant volatility of the russian ruble impact this segment 

effects of inflation 

economies in some countries where we operate particularly belarus russia kazakhstan ukraine and india have periodically experienced high rates of inflation periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business as of december 31 2018  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 7706 million  and 2746 million  of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and as of december 31 2018  all cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating needs and we have no intention of repatriating those funds as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor our mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances and we may decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states in the future during the year ended december 31 2018 we repatriated 1675 million of cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to the united states if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends in the future 2428 million  would be subject to foreign withholding taxes we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be sufficient to fund our domestic operations and obligations for the foreseeable future 

we have cash in banks in belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan and armenia where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured as of december 31 2018  the total amount of cash held in these countries was 1795 million  and of this amount 1197 million  was located in belarus 

as of december 31 2018  we had 2746 million  available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and our outstanding debt of 250 million  represents the minimal required borrowing to keep the credit facility active as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all covenants specified under the credit facility and anticipate being in compliance for the foreseeable future see note 8  “longterm debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our longterm debt 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

2018  compared to 2017 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2018  increased 994 million  or 515  to 2922 million  as compared to 2017  primarily driven by the 1675 million  increase in net income and 8 day improvement in days sales outstanding partially offset by the payout of a higher level of variable compensation related to 2017 performance and a noncash increase in net deferred tax assets of 260 million  as a result of our decision to change the tax status and to classify most of our foreign subsidiaries as disregarded for us income tax purposes 

2017  compared to 2016 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017 increased 256 million  or 153  to 1928 million  as compared to 2016 primarily driven by the 393 million increase in income from operations the 743 million increase in the provision for income taxes had minimal impact on cash flow as it was offset by a 705 million increase in taxes payable primarily attributable to the us tax act which are expected to be paid over the next 8 years 

investing activities 

2018  compared to 2017 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2018  was 1121 million  compared to 362 million  used in the same period in 2017  during 2018  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the net 743 million  cash used to acquire continuum innovation llc and think limited and an increase in capital expenditures of 78 million  compared to the same period last year 

2017  compared to 2016   

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2017 was 362 million compared to 93 million used in the same period in 2016 during 2017 the investing cash outflow was primarily attributed to capital expenditures of 298 million and was consistent with capital expenditures of 293 million in 2016 our capital expenditures during 2017 were driven by our continuous investment in facilities and computer equipment to support our increased headcount cash inflows during 2016 included a 300 million increase in cash upon maturity of certain time deposits while there were no material time deposit maturities during 2017 

financing activities 

2018  compared to 2017 

during the year ended december 31 2018  net cash provided by financing activities was 230 million  representing a 267 million  decrease from 497 million  cash provided by financing activities in 2017  during 2018  net cash received from the exercises of stock options issued under our longterm incentive plans was 348 million  a decrease of 191 million  from the 540 million  during 2017  

2017  compared to 2016   

during the year ended december 31 2017 net cash provided by financing activities was 497 million representing a 393 million increase from 105 million cash provided by financing activities in 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from increased exercises of stock options issued under our longterm incentive plans during 2017 stock option exercises contributed 540 million of cash compared to 180 million during 2016 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  





as of december 31 2018  we had 14 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters in addition we had recorded 75 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2018  related to the acquisitions of businesses that are not included in the table above due to the uncertainty involved with the potential payments 

letters of credit 

at december 31 2018  we had one irrevocable standby letter of credit totaling 04 million under the 2017 credit facility which is required to secure commitments for office rent the letter of credit expires on august 2 2019 with a possibility of extension for an additional period of one year from the present or any future expiration date 

future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future however our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 14  “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks result primarily from concentrations of credit changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues 

we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 

we have cash in banks in countries such as belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan and armenia where the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities are not insured as of december 31 2018  1795 million  of total cash was kept in banks in these countries of which 1197 million  was held in belarus in this region and particularly in belarus a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the region which could adversely affect our business and financial condition cash in this region is used for shortterm operational needs and cash balances in those banks move with the needs of those entities 

accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across many customers operating in different industries therefore concentration of credit risk is limited there were no customers individually exceeding 10 of our accounts receivable or unbilled revenues as of december 31 2018  there were no  customers individually exceeding 10 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 during the year ended december 31 2016  the company had one  customer ubs ag  which contributed revenues of 1376 million  and accounted for more than 10 of total revenues in the period indicated 

during the year ended   december 31 2018  our top five customers accounted for 223  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 316  of our total revenues during the year ended   december 31 2017  our top five customers accounted for 240  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 339  of our total revenues 

 though our results of operations depend on our ability to successfully collect payment from our customers for work performed historically credit losses and writeoffs of accounts receivable balances have not been material to our consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is influenced by the changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalent deposits and paid on any outstanding balance on our borrowings mainly under our 2017 credit facility which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the type and timing of funds borrowed we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to these deposits and borrowings 

foreign exchange risk 

our global operations are conducted predominantly in us dollars other than us dollars we generate revenues principally in euros british pounds swiss francs canadian dollars and russian rubles other than us dollars we incur expenditures principally in russian rubles hungarian forints polish zlotys british pounds swiss francs euros indian rupees and chinese yuan renminbi associated with the location of our delivery centers as a result currency fluctuations specifically the depreciation of the euro british pound and canadian dollar and the appreciation of russian rubles hungarian forints polish zlotys chinese yuan renminbi and indian rupees relative to the us dollar could negatively impact our results of operations 

during the year ended december 31 2018  our foreign exchange gain was 05 million  compared to a 32 million  loss reported last year 

during the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 355  of consolidated revenues and 415  of operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

 during 2018 we implemented a hedging program through which we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted russian ruble indian rupee and polish zloty transactions we entered into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated operating expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly they are not speculative in nature as of december 31 2018  the net unrealized loss from these hedges was 33 million  

management supplements results reported in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles referred to as gaap with nongaap financial measures management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating its performance when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared on the basis of “constant currency” which is a nongaap financial measure this measure excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 

during the year ended december 31 2018  we reported revenue growth of 271  had our consolidated revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2017 we would have reported revenue growth of 269  during 2018 revenues have benefited from the appreciation of the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar which was partially offset by the depreciation of the russian ruble relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2018  we reported net income growth of 2302  over the previous year had our consolidated results been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2017 we would have reported net income growth of 2263  net income has been positively impacted by appreciation of the euro and the depreciation of the russian ruble partially offset by the appreciation of the polish zloty relative to the us dollar

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management has excluded continuum innovation llc together with its subsidiaries and think limited from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 since these entities were acquired in business combinations in 2018 these businesses are included in our 2018 consolidated financial statements and constituted 60 of total assets as of december 31 2018 and 20 of revenues for the year then ended

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

our delivery model 

we believe the development of a robust global delivery model creates a key competitive advantage enabling us to better understand and meet our clients’ diverse needs and to provide a compelling value proposition we serve clients through onsite offsite and offshore locations across the world in belarus ukraine russia hungary poland india china kazakhstan mexico bulgaria armenia czech republic slovakia the united states canada the united kingdom germany sweden switzerland netherlands the united arab emirates singapore hong kong austria spain ireland and australia our delivery centers are located strategically to offer a strong diversified and costeffective delivery platform to serve clients across north america europe and apac our largest delivery centers are located in belarus russia and ukraine we continuously grow our delivery platform both organically and through acquired delivery centers and client management locations our revenue generating personnel numbered 22998  as of december 31 2017  

as of december 31 2017  we had 7372  it professionals located in belarus the majority of these it professionals are located in minsk the capital of belarus which is wellpositioned to serve as a prime it outsourcing destination given its strong industrial base and established educational infrastructure furthermore the it industry in belarus has been strongly supported by its government which has taken steps to encourage investment in the it sector through longterm tax incentives 

our locations in ukraine and russia offer many of the same benefits as belarus including educational infrastructure availability of qualified software engineers and government support of the it industry as of december 31 2017  we had 4818  it professionals in ukraine and 3802  it professionals in russia our delivery model has not been materially affected by the political and economic uncertainty in russia or ukraine to date 

our other significant locations with it professionals are hungary with 1460  the united states with 1316  poland with 1167  india with 822  and china with 509  as of december 31 2017  

human capital 

attracting and retaining employees is a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and meet our clients’ needs we have dedicated fulltime employees that oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including a professional talent acquisition team whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced it professionals within various epam locations it is critical that we effectively plan our shortterm and longterm recruitment needs and deploy the necessary personnel and processes to optimize utilization and quickly satisfy the demands of our clients as our business grows we also focus on hiring and retaining individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive finance legal hr and other key management positions 

at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we had a total of 25962  22383  and 18354 employees respectively of these employees as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 22998  19670  and 16078 were revenue generating it professionals 

in our competitive industry the ability to hire and retain highlyskilled information technology professionals is critical to our success we believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our clients to attract retain and motivate our it professionals we offer a challenging work environment ongoing skills development initiatives attractive career advancement and promotion opportunities thus providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance 

historically we developed our base of it professionals by hiring highlyqualified experienced it professionals from the cis and cee regions and by recruiting students from the regions’ leading universities the quality and academic prestige of the cis and cee educational systems are renowned worldwide and we have strong relationships with the leading institutions in these geographies we have established epam delivery centers near many of these university campuses our ongoing involvement with these universities includes supporting epambranded research labs developing training courses providing teaching equipment actively supporting curriculum development and engaging students to identify their talents and interests our relationships with these technical institutions provide us access to a highlyqualified talent pool 

 we believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and our employees have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements other than broad industrywide agreements as required in certain countries in europe and mexico or engaged in any labor disputes 

training and development 

we dedicate significant resources to the training and development of our it professionals we believe in the importance of supporting educational initiatives and we sponsor employees’ participation in internal and external training and certifications 

we provide training continuing education and career development programs for both entrylevel and experienced it professionals entrylevel it professionals undergo a rigorous training program that consists of approximately three to six months of classroom training as well as numerous hours of handson training through actual engagements this comprehensive program results in employees who are highly proficient and possess deep technical expertise that enables them to immediately serve our clients’ needs for our midlevel and senior it professionals we offer continuing education programs aimed at helping them advance in their careers we also provide mentoring opportunities management and soft skills training intensive workshops and management and technical advancement programs in order to support the development of middle and senior management through formal leadership training evaluation development and promotion 

quality and process management 

we have invested resources in developing a proprietary suite of internal applications and tools to manage all aspects of our delivery process these applications and tools are targeted to reduce costs and security risks while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our clients in addition these applications tools methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions to global clients further strengthening our relationships with them 

we are an isae 3402 type 2 certified it services provider this certification is a widely recognized auditing standard developed by the american institute of certified public accountants and it serves as additional assurance to our clients regarding the control environment and the security of their sensitive data furthermore this is an important certification for firms in data and informationintensive industries as well as any organization that is subject to the internal controls certification requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended or the sarbanesoxley act our isae 3402 type 2 certification in addition to our multiple iso 270012013 and iso 90012015 attestations underscores our focus on establishing stringent security standards and internal controls 

our proprietary iso 90012015 and cmmicertified quality management system has been documented implemented and maintained to ensure the timely delivery of software development services to our clients we have also developed sophisticated project management techniques facilitated through our project management center a webbased collaborative environment for software development which we consider critical to meeting or exceeding the service levels required by our clients 

our quality management system ensures that we provide timely delivery of software development services to enhance client satisfaction by enabling 

 our proprietary project management center supports our software development delivery model our project management center is effective in reducing risks and providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages based on the following features 

 the transparency and visibility into software development project deliverables resource management team messaging and projectrelated documents and files provided by our project management center promotes collaboration and strengthens our relationships with our clients improved traceability enables significant time savings and cost reductions for business users and it management during change management for the software development lifecycle the combination of our project management center with our other proprietary internal applications enhances our offering by reducing errors increasing quality effectiveness and oversight and improving maintenance time 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as cee india and china we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings reputation and track record for highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to clients’ business needs scale financial stability and price 

we face competition primarily from accenture atos origin capgemini cognizant technology solutions deloitte digital dxc technology exlservice genpact globallogic globant sa hcl technologies hp enterprise ibm global services infosys technologies luxoft holding inc mindtree syntel inc perficient tata consultancy services virtusa corporation and wipro among others additionally we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate 

we believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions our technical employee base and the development and continuous improvement in process methodologies applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future 

intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our clients we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us which assign to us all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential 

we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients these customary agreements cover our use of the clients’ software systems and platforms as our clients usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them furthermore we usually grant a perpetual worldwide royaltyfree nonexclusive transferable and nonrevocable license to our clients to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them 

regulations 

due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations several foreign and us federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business see “item 1a risk factors — risks relating to our business — we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anticorruption laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures”

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described below which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock you should carefully review the following discussion of the most significant risk factors applicable to us which we have listed below and are not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence additionally forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks relating to our business 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources 

we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business over the past several years both organically and through acquisitions our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure continued expansion increases the challenges we face in 

 moreover we intend to continue our expansion for the foreseeable future and pursue available opportunities as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological operational compliance and administrative risks and challenges as a result of these challenges associated with expansion we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth and our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to successfully attract train and retain new it professionals with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to those clients 

the ability to hire and retain highlyskilled information technology professionals is critical to our success to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business we must attract train and retain skilled it professionals including those with management experience competition for it professionals can be intense in the markets where we operate if we are unable to hire or retain all of the it professionals necessary to meet our ongoing and future business needs we may have to forgo projects due to lack of resources 

 a significant increase in the attrition rate among it professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services in addition any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire it professionals to meet our business requirements may suffer 

increases in wages for our it professionals and other compensation expense could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wage costs for it professionals in cis cee and apac and certain other geographies in which we operate are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the service industry in these countries may increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our it professionals wage inflation may also increase our cost of providing services and reduce our profitability 

additionally we have granted certain equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and entered into other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past and expect to continue this practice the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness to us of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the value of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations the issuance of equitybased compensation also results in additional dilution to our stockholders 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted if any of our senior executives or key personnel such as business development managers joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients suppliers knowhow and key it professionals and staff members to them 

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization and productivity levels 

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization and productivity levels of fixedcost resources such as our professionals as well as other resources such as computers and office space our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals to plan effectively for future needs to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any client or on any project for which we have dedicated it professionals or facilities we may not be able to reallocate these it professionals and facilities to other clients and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks 

we are a global company with substantial international operations our revenues from clients outside north america represented 420  422  and 464  of our revenues including reimbursable expenses and other revenues for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the majority of our personnel along with our development and delivery centers are located in the cis and cee the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks 

risks inherent in conducting international operations include 

 we earn our revenues and incur our expenses in multiple currencies which exposes us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues receivables compensation purchases and capital expenditures currency exchange volatility caused by political or economic instability or other factors could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

the it services industry is particularly sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our clients may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate our clients and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which we operate regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for it services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified it professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled it professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks 

we have significant operations in cis and cee countries india and other asian countries which are generally considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including those that may result from foreign laws and regulations the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions tax increases fluctuations in exchange rates inflation unstable political and military situations labor issues and less established legal systems the economies of certain countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns such economic instability and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations may be adversely affected by ongoing conflict in ukraine 

continuing military activities in ukraine have combined with ukraine’s weak economic conditions to fuel ongoing economic uncertainty in ukraine russia and other markets the european union united states and other nations have imposed and may continue imposing further economic sanctions including specific sanctions on certain russian entities specifically in the energy defense and financial sectors prolonged political instability in ukraine sanctions against russia and russia’s potential response to such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our operations we have delivery centers in the ukraine employing 4818  it professionals as of december 31 2017 none of which are located in the most volatile regions of eastern ukraine we also have delivery centers in russia employing 3802  it professionals as of december 31 2017 located in various cities including moscow and st petersburg to date we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our clients we continue to monitor the situation closely our contingency plans include relocating work andor personnel to other locations and adding new locations as appropriate 

the us congress and trump administration may make substantial changes to fiscal political regulatory and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 

changes in general economic or political conditions in the united states or other regions could adversely affect our business for example the administration under president donald trump has indicated that it may propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues including international trade agreements import and export regulations tariffs and customs duties foreign relations immigration laws and corporate governance laws that could have a positive or negative impact on our business 

we do not have longterm commitments from our clients and our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts a loss of business from significant clients could materially affect our results of operations 

our ability to maintain continuing relationships with our major clients is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific client is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our clients’ exclusive it services provider and we generally do not have longterm commitments from clients to purchase our services the ability of our clients to terminate engagements with or without cause makes our future revenues uncertain although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from clients who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end 

there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including a client’s 

 termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and thus compress our margins until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount the loss of any of our major clients or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them if not replaced by new client engagements could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our clients is concentrated in five specific industry verticals financial services software and hitech media and entertainment travel and consumer and life sciences and healthcare our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these five industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource it services 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes decreased demand for our services or increased pricing pressure on us from our clients in these key industries could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts and setting terms with our clients our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts assumptions and predictions about our projects the marketplace global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility and the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated longterm cost savings that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract because of these inherent uncertainties we may underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we are not able to pass on to our clients increases in compensation costs whether driven by competition for talent or ordinarycourse pay increases or charge premium prices when justified by market demand or the type of service our profitability may suffer 

in addition a number of our contracts contain pricing terms that condition a portion of the payment of fees by the client on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules set forth in the contracts our failure to meet such performance goals service levels or completion schedules or our failure to meet client expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements 

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

to successfully perform larger and more complex projects we need to establish and maintain effective close relationships with our clients continue high levels of client satisfaction and develop a thorough understanding of our clients’ operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including 

 our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our management personnel and it professionals in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements failure to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business compress our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our it services before potential clients commit to use our services they require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients’ decision to select another it service provider or inhouse resources to perform the services and the timing of our clients’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth for certain clients we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our current and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to whom we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could materially adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients if our clients suffer financial difficulties it could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues we usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we face intense competition for clients and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services companies and increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

the market for it services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations clients tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other competing it services providers clients may prefer it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate 

current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore it services providers which could seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our clients operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources therefore we may be unable to retain our clients while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business client buying patterns can change if clients become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers with less emphasis on quality 

our ability to generate and retain business depends on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our service and our clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients and employees competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if untrue could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be challenging to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose clients and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in it services enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing client needs the process of developing our client solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with anticipate or respond to these changes is subject to a number of risks including that 

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our clients could materially adversely affect our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of business or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current clients and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of client data a failure to attract new clients or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our clients and us errors will not be found in new software product development solutions which could result in litigation other claims for damages against us as well as reputational harm and thus could materially adversely affect our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we have access to collect store process and transmit sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees in our data centers and on our networks physical security and the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen such a breach or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by these events any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under applicable laws and regulatory penalties and could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by the disclosure of confidential information system failures or errors 

 if any person including any of our personnel misappropriates sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws some of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for certain occurrences including breaches of confidentiality and infringement indemnity furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief any such breach or misappropriation resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

if we cause disruptions to our clients’ businesses or provide inadequate service our clients may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose clients have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

if our it professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our clients or fail to consistently meet the service requirements of a client these errors or failures could disrupt the client’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us and could also result in a client terminating our engagement any failure in a client’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure the assertion of one or more large claims against us whether or not successful could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant failure in our telecommunications or it infrastructure or systems could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenue and otherwise disrupt our business 

part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications financial control accounting customer service and other data processing systems between our clients’ offices our delivery centers and our client management locations moreover many of our key systems for corporate operations are internallydeveloped applications our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these internet it or communication systems which could be caused by among other things software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrading damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online or increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenue or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

we may invest substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

as our business grows we may invest in new facilities and physical infrastructure we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies do not perform to our expectations our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

part of our expansion strategy includes strategic acquisitions these transactions involve significant challenges including the risk that an acquisition does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve a satisfactory return on our investment that we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company’s employees client relationships and operations and that the transactions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and making it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties 

the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including but not limited to a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business 

the ongoing effects of the us tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” and the refinement of provisional estimates could make our results difficult to predict 

our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the us tax act which was enacted on december 22 2017 the us tax act introduces significant changes to us income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes accounting for the income tax effects of the us tax act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the us tax act 

due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the us tax act we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the us treasury department the internal revenue service “irs” and other standardsetting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the us tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the us tax act and any additional guidance issued by the irs or other standardsetting bodies we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus and other countries to companies in our industry 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from belarusian income tax which as of the date of this annual report was 18 and from the value added tax until 2049 and taxed at other reduced rates on a variety of other taxes our subsidiary in russia benefits from a substantially reduced rate on social contributions and an exemption on value added tax in certain circumstances which is a benefit to qualified it companies in russia if these tax benefits are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — provision for income taxes” 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of some of our personnel or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

certain of our personnel are retained as independent contractors in several countries the criteria to determine whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary by jurisdiction as can the interpretation of the applicable laws if a government authority or court makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we classify our us employees as “exempt” or “nonexempt” under the federal labor standards act “flsa” and the flsa criteria for these classifications are subject to change from time to time if it were determined that any of our us employees should be classified as “nonexempt” under the flsa we may incur costs and liabilities for back wages unpaid overtime fines or penalties andor be subject to employee litigation 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses 

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources 

most of the agreements we have entered into with our clients require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate 

the banking and financial systems in less developed markets where we hold funds remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore in russia belarus and other cis countries bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability a banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in that region which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability as a result we might face significant legal liability and payment obligations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as that in the united states or other countries with more mature legal systems 

we require our employees and independent contractors to enter into written agreements with us upon the commencement of their relationship with us which assign to epam all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or engagement with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients and certain vendors however these  a greements may not fully protect our trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our clients’ technologies tools and applications without paying us for doing so and our clients may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks 

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties 

we typically indemnify clients who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our clients redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property that such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our clients may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms in addition we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies 

further our current and former employees andor subcontractors could challenge our exclusive rights in the software they have developed in the course of their employment in russia and certain other countries in which we operate an employer is deemed to own the copyright in works created by its employees during the course and within the scope of their employment but the employer may be required to satisfy additional legal requirements in order to make further use and dispose of such works while we believe that we have complied with all such requirements and have fulfilled all requirements necessary to acquire all rights in software developed by our independent contractors andor subcontractors these requirements are often ambiguously defined and enforced as a result we cannot assure that we would be successful in defending against any claim by our current or former employees independent contractors andor subcontractors challenging our exclusive rights over the use and transfer of works those employees independent contractors andor subcontractors created or requesting additional compensation for such works 

parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential clients deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our clients against infringement claims in certain instances any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anticorruption laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

as a company with international operations we are subject to many laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and antibribery and anticorruption laws in other countries we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under us and other antibribery laws 

we have a compliance program with controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and other sanctions laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of such program may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws 

changes in the european regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection regulations could expose us to risks of noncompliance and costs associated with compliance 

in europe we are subject to the 1995 european union directive on data protection “1995 data protection directive” which requires european union member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that in some respects are more stringent and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses than current privacy standards in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines the european union member state regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the european union to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security on december 15 2015 the european parliament and the council of the european union reached a political agreement on the future european union data protection legal framework referred to as the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which will replace the 1995 data protection directive the gdpr will have significant impacts on how businesses can collect and process the personal data of european union individuals the gdpr will become effective in may 2018 

the company is undertaking measures to seek to comply with the gdpr by the effective date the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions alter the way we conduct business andor could otherwise have a material adverse impact on our results of operations we may be unsuccessful in establishing legitimate means of transferring data from the european economic area we may experience hesitancy reluctance or refusal by european or multinational customers to continue to use our services due to the potential risk exposure to such customers as a result of the implementation of gdpr and we and our customers are at risk of enforcement actions taken by the european union data protection authority until such point in time that we ensure that all data transfers to us from the european economic area are legitimized we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain euorigin data in the european economic area which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business further the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by such laws regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

antioutsourcing legislation and restrictions on immigration if adopted may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the majority of our employees are nationals of cis and cee countries some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our clients’ facilities which are sometimes located outside the cis and cee the ability of our employees to work in necessary locations around the world depends on their ability to obtain the required visas and work permits and this process can be lengthy and difficult immigration laws are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions 

in addition the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues it is possible that pending legislation in the united states regarding offshore outsourcing may impose restrictions on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to client locations which could adversely impact our business it is generally difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or maintaining business visas for our employees however if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain work visas 

our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our clients on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the 2017 us executive order “protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states” restricts entry into the united states of nonus nationals from a number of enumerated countries in the middle east and suspends a visa interview waiver program that was in place at us consulates worldwide while the travel restrictions do not extend to nationals of cis and cee countries it is possible that there could be delays in visa processing before cis and cee nationals can enter the united states and their wait times for visa interviews may increase significantly delays in the process to obtain visas may result in delays in the ability of our personnel to travel to meet with our clients provide services to our clients or to continue to provide services on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

similarly legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in european jurisdictions or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of services from an offshore location could also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union countries this legislation creates a risk that companies outsourcing their business in whole or in part to an it services provider effectively give the affected employees of the company or its previous it services provider whose positions have been impacted the right to become employees of the new it services provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment there is also a related risk of unfair dismissal claims arising from dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous it services provider immediately prior to the outsourcing this risk could materially affect our ability to obtain new business and provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and european union in a costeffective manner 

our cis subsidiaries can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements 

we operate in cis countries primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of other cis countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if the company fails to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation for any damages if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility and we cannot be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders and additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could impose operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 

our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

our liabilityclassified restricted stock units which are subject to marktomarket accounting and the calculation of weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding in accordance with the treasury method are both affected by our stock price any fluctuations in the price of our stock will affect our future operating results

overview of 2017 and financial highlights

the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2017  were as follows 



 the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report 

revenues  — we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report if there is uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved at the time revenues are recognized we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms 

we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings which represent specific competencies of our it professionals contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements 

the majority of our revenues  903  of revenues in 2017  882  in 2016  and 858  in 2015  are generated under timeandmaterial contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues the majority of such revenues are billed using hourly daily or monthly rates by which actual time incurred is charged directly to the client we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future 

revenues from fixedprice contracts  83  of revenues in 2017  104  in 2016  and 128  in 2015  include fixedprice maintenance and support arrangements which may exceed one year in duration as well as fixedprice application development arrangements revenues from maintenance and support arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the expected service period revenues from fixedprice application development arrangements are determined using the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the client revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in the absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates used in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could affect the amount of revenues receivables and deferred revenues at each reporting period 

business combinations — we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805 “business combinations” we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain 

if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings 

goodwill and other intangible assets — we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october 31st and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value effective january 1 2017 we earlyadopted asu 201704 which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill when measuring an impairment as a result when conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment we use a twostep process the first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances in performing this assessment we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business industry and market trends as well as the overall future financial performance of a reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment we perform a second step consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment this quantitative assessment requires us to estimate impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

historically a significant portion of the purchase consideration related to our acquisitions was allocated to customer relationships in valuing customer relationships we typically utilize the multiperiod excess earnings method a form of the income approach the principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the aftertax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset only we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives on a straightline basis or if reliably determinable the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected discounted future cash flows amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives that predominantly range from five to ten years we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 

we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified in assessing fair value we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges if the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 

accounting for income taxes — we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes we estimate separately our deferred tax assets related valuation allowances current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the us internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” the us tax act significantly changes us corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 and the creation of a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax in addition the tax act creates new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain related party payments which are referred to as the global intangible lowtaxed income tax and the base erosion antiabuse tax respectively 

due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the us tax act we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of december 31 2017  as we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the us tax act and any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies and further refine our calculations we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded we will complete our analysis over a oneyear measurement period ending in the second half of 2018 any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in the provision for income taxes in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined 

stockbased compensation  — stockbased compensation expense relating to the issuance of equityclassified sharebased awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant which is expensed over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures equitybased awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately 

adjusting stockbased compensation expense for estimated forfeitures requires judgment if we change our assumptions stockbased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 

stockbased compensation expense in a period could be impacted favorably or unfavorably by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unvested stockbased compensation expense 

equitybased awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the end of each reporting period future stockbased compensation expense related to our liabilityclassified awards may increase or decrease as a result of changes in the market price for our stock adding to the volatility in our operating results 

our adoption of asu 201609 effective january 1 2017 increased income tax expense volatility our future operating results will depend on the fluctuations in the stock price on the dates the awards vest or options are exercised and the magnitude of transactions occurring in each reporting period among other factors 

change in presentation of certain financial information  — as part of our discussion and analysis we analyze revenues by client location and by vertical prior to the first quarter of 2017 management did not include reimbursable expenses and other revenues in its discussion of revenue performance across locations and verticals effective in the first quarter of 2017 we have allocated reimbursable expenses and other revenues which primarily include travel and entertainment costs chargeable to clients to corresponding geographies and verticals we believe this change allows us to more effectively analyze our verticals and geographies by streamlining the presentation of revenues both internally and externally using a standardized approach these changes did not result in any adjustments to our previously issued financial statements and were applied retrospectively beginning on january 1 2015 comparative information for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 is presented in the following tables

results of operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 







revenues 

our revenues are derived primarily from providing software development services to our clients revenues include revenue from services as well as license revenues reimbursable expenses and other revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2017  our revenues were 145 billion  growing 250  over last year total revenues in 2017  and 2016  included 171 million  and 125 million  of reimbursable expenses and other revenues respectively which increased 369  in 2017  as compared to 2016  but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues growth in revenue is attributable to both the expansion of existing business with current clients and deeper penetration into verticals where we have an established and increasing presence 

during 2016  our revenues grew 269  over 2015  from 9141 million  to 116 billion  total revenues in 2016  and 2015  included 125 million  and 95 million  of reimbursable expenses and other revenues respectively which increased by 316  in 2016  as compared to 2015  but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues 

we discuss below the breakdown of our revenue by client location service offering vertical contract type and client concentration 

revenues by vertical 

we analyze our revenue by separating our clients into five main industry sectors or verticals as detailed in the following table also we serve clients in other industries such as oil and gas telecommunications and several others which are reported in the aggregate under emerging verticals 

prior to the first quarter of 2017 we did not include reimbursable expenses and other revenues in our revenue results across locations and verticals effective in the first quarter of 2017 we have allocated reimbursable expenses and other revenues which primarily include travel and entertainment costs chargeable to clients to corresponding geographies and verticals we believe this change allows us to more effectively analyze our verticals and geographies by streamlining the presentation of revenues both internally and externally using a standardized approach these changes did not result in any adjustments to our previously issued financial statements and were applied retrospectively effective january 1 2015 our revenues by vertical and as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented are as follows 







revenues by client location 

our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets north america europe cis and apac we present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed revenue by client location is different from the revenue by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report segments are not based on the geographic location of the clients but instead they are based on the location of the company’s management responsible for a particular client 

the following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 





2017  compared to 2016   

during the year ended december 31 2017  revenues in our largest geography north america closed at 8407 million  growing 1701 million  or 254  from 6706 million  reported for the year ended december 31 2016  revenues from this geography accounted for 580  of total revenues in 2017  a level consistent with the prior year 

within north america we experienced strong growth across all verticals with the media and entertainment vertical contributing 317  of total growth in the north american geography in addition our traditionally strong software  hitech portfolio grew 196  year over year we saw continued growth in emerging verticals with 442  growth in revenues with 297 of the growth coming from customers who have been with us less than one year 

revenues in our europe geography were 5113 million  an increase of 935 million  or 224  over 4178 million  last year revenues in this geography accounted for 352  of consolidated revenues in 2017 as compared to 360  last year europe experienced strong growth in the media and entertainment life sciences and healthcare and emerging verticals each of which grew over 55 during 2017 over 70 of the growth in our europe geography in 2017 came from customers who have been with us less than two years financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography accounting for 411 of the europe geography’s revenues in 2017 as compared to 477 in 2016 

revenues in the cis geography increased 223 million  or 483  from last year the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and emerging verticals revenues in this geography benefited by 59 million from the appreciation of the russian ruble relative to the us dollar 

2016  compared to 2015   

during the year ended december 31 2016 revenues in our largest geography north america closed at 6706 million  growing 1803 million  or 368  from 4903 million  reported for the year ended december 31 2015 revenues from this geography accounted for 578  of total revenues in 2016 an increase of 42  from 536  reported in 2015 

within north america we experienced strong growth across all verticals despite considerable market geopolitical and economic uncertainties each of the two verticals media and entertainment and life sciences and healthcare grew above 40 while emerging verticals and financial services grew 596  and 949  respectively in addition our traditionally strong software  hitech portfolio grew 273  which allowed us to keep this important segment at our strategic target of 20 of consolidated revenues 

we saw continued traction with customers in the pharmaceutical segment of our life sciences and healthcare vertical and significantly grew our portfolio of customers in emerging verticals with over 30 growth in revenues there coming from customers who have been with us less than one year combined growth in our software  hitech and media  entertainment verticals accounted for 486 of the overall growth in the north america geography of which 196 million or 224 was attributable to the expansion of existing relationship with certain longstanding customers within our media and entertainment vertical 

revenues in our europe geography were 4178 million  an increase of 613 million  or 172  over 3565 million  reported in 2015 revenues in this geography accounted for 360  of consolidated revenues in 2016 as compared to 390  in 2015 the slowdown in revenue growth in 2016 was largely attributable to decelerated growth in revenues from our top customer in this geography coupled with increased internal and external pressures on customers within our travel and consumer vertical and currency headwinds primarily due to the depreciation of the british pound relative to the us dollar 

consistent with results in our north america geography europe experienced strong growth in the media and entertainment life sciences and healthcare and emerging verticals each of which grew over 48 during 2016 over 40 of growth in life sciences and healthcare and emerging verticals came from customers who have been with us less than one year financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography and accounted for 340 of the overall growth in 2016 

revenues in the cis geography showed an increase of 30 million  or 69  from 2015 the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and travel and consumer verticals 

 revenues by client concentration 

while we seek to grow revenues from our existing clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements we expect client concentration from our top clients to continue to decrease over the longterm the following table sets forth revenues including reimbursable expenses contributed by our top one top five top ten and top twenty clients by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 



 during the year ended december 31 2017  our revenue growth outside the top twenty accounts was 204587  or 343  

we have longstanding relationships with many of our customers and revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts mature or upon completion of multiyear projects our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 949  and 857  of our revenues in 2017  coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively while we believe there’s a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within specific domains and verticals we continue to focus on diversification of our client concentration and building up a portfolio of accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential we anticipate the contribution of these accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid to longterm and offset the slower growth rate of some of our largest customers as those accounts mature 

revenues by service offering 

our endtoend service offerings are grouped into five main categories with software development representing our core competency and a substantial majority of our business the following table sets forth revenues by service offering by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

revenues by contract type 

our engagement models are based on the type of services provided to a client the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve our two types of service arrangements are timeandmaterial and fixedprice contracts historically the majority of our revenues have been generated under timeandmaterial contracts and we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future 

under timeandmaterial contracts we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly daily or monthly rates fixedprice contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on agreed intervals 

the following table sets forth revenues by contract type by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation expense project related travel costs and fees for subcontractors who are assigned to client projects salaries and other compensation expenses of our revenue generating professionals are reported as cost of revenues regardless of whether the employees are actually performing client services during a given period our employees are a critical asset necessary for our continued success and therefore we expect to continue hiring talented employees and providing them with competitive compensation programs 

we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects some of our it professionals are hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or projects our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services 

2017 compared to 2016 

during the year ended december 31 2017  cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 9214 million  representing an increase of 250  from 7372 million  reported last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 150  growth in the average number of production headcount for the year as well as a 23  impact from appreciation of foreign currencies 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 635  and 636  during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively our utilization in 2017 improved by 38 as compared to 2016 which was offset by higher compensation expense and the unfavorable impact of appreciation of the russian ruble hungarian forint and polish zloty as compared to the us dollar 

2016 compared to 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 7372 million representing an increase of 300 from 5669 million reported in 2015 the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 342 growth in the average number of production headcount for the year 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 636 and 620 during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively of this increase 15 was attributable to a decrease in utilization during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general administrative functions of our business these expenses include the costs of salaries bonuses fringe benefits stockbased compensation expense commissions travel legal and audit services insurance operating leases advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues generated in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hitech park 

2017 compared to 2016 

as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth our selling general and administrative expenses have been increasing during the year ended december 31 2017  selling general and administrative expenses were 3249 million  representing an increase of 227  as compared to 2647 million  reported last year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2017  was driven by a 276 million  increase in personnelrelated costs a 166  increase related to investments in facilities and infrastructure to support the increased headcount and 70 million of higher spending related to talent acquisition and development 

expressed as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased 04  to 224  for the year ended december 31 2017  we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but generally to remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues over time 

2016 compared to 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2016 selling general and administrative expenses were 2647 million representing an increase of 188 as compared to 2228 million reported in 2015 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2016 was primarily driven by a 146 million increase in personnelrelated costs coupled with a 165 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to investments in facilities and infrastructure to support the increased headcount and 40 million higher spending related to talent acquisition and development 

expressed as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased 16 to 228 for the year ended december 31 2016 the decrease was primarily attributable to higher revenue growth as compared to the growth in compensation driven by the increased headcount and wage inflation coupled with relatively limited growth in stockbased compensation 

depreciation and amortization expense 

2017 compared to 2016 

during the year ended december 31 2017  depreciation and amortization expense was 286 million  representing an increase of 52 million  from 234 million  reported last year the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to an increase in computer equipment to support headcount growth depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired finitelived intangible assets expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to 2016 

2016 compared to 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2016 depreciation and amortization expense was 234 million representing an increase of 60 million from 174 million reported in 2015 the increase was predominantly driven by depreciation of computer equipment and infrastructure related to increased headcount and amortization of intangible assets purchased with the acquisitions of businesses completed in 2015 expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense was 20 a slight increase from 19 reported in the same period in 2015 

other operating expenses net 

there were no material changes in other operating expenses net during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2016 and 2015 

interest and other income net 

interest and other income net is comprised of interest earned on cash accounts in belarus interest earned on employee housing loans and other income and is partially offset by interest expense related to our revolving credit facility there were no material changes in interest and other income net in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 2015 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2017  2016  and 2015 we had 1809 million  1358 million  and 1138 million  respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pretax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest expense tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

  

in belarus member technology companies of hightechnologies park have a full exemption from belarus income tax this tax holiday was recently extended through january 2049 the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated 155 million  136 million  and 208 million  for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated 028  026  and 040  for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

as we continue to grow our onsite presence and expand the geographic footprint of our delivery centers this may result in volatility in our effective tax rate other factors that may contribute favorably or unfavorably to the overall effective tax rate in 2018 and beyond must be considered as well these factors include statutory tax rate changes in the countries that are part of our geographic footprint and excess tax benefits upon vesting or exercise of equity awards 

2017 compared to 2016 

the provision for income taxes was 1015 million  in 2017  and 272 million  in 2016  the increase in the effective tax rate from 215  in 2016  to 583  in 2017  was primarily due to a provisional 746 million  charge as a result of the united states tax cuts and jobs act “us tax act” enacted on december 22 2017 the us tax act significantly changes us corporate income tax laws including a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 350 to 210 effective january 1 2018 and the creation of a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax in addition the us tax act creates new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings and certain related party payments which are referred to as the global intangible lowtaxed income tax and the base erosion tax respectively the charge was comprised of a 643 million  provisional charge due to a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to us income tax as well as a 103 million  provisional charge due to the impact of the change in the us statutory tax rate from 350 to 210 in the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized as a result of the us tax act 

in 2017 we also reassessed our accumulated foreign earnings in light of the us tax act and determined 970 million  of our accumulated earnings in belarus are no longer indefinitely reinvested as a result we recorded a charge of 49 million  in the provision for income taxes during the year ended december 31 2017  for the withholding tax that will be payable to belarus when the earnings are expatriated 

these charges were partially offset by the adoption of a new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017 whereby excess tax benefits of 93 million  were recognized for the year ended december 31 2017 in the income tax provision rather than additional paidincapital 

other factors include changes in the geographic mix of our earnings attributable to foreign operations toward jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates as well as small decreases in statutory tax rates in hungary ukraine and the united kingdom 

2016 compared to 2015 

provision for income taxes was 272 million in 2016 and 216 million in 2015 the increase in the effective tax rate from 204 in 2015 to 215 in 2016 was predominantly caused by the changes in the geographic mix of our earnings including 



foreign exchange gain  loss 

for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — foreign exchange risk” 

effects of inflation 

economies in cis countries particularly belarus russia kazakhstan and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries and as a result negatively impact the business of our existing clients and decrease demand for our services we do not rely on borrowed funds for operations in those locations therefore increases in interest rates typical for inflationary environments do not currently pose a risk to our business inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages 

 while inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant 

results by business segment 

our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other there were no operations in the other segment for 2017 and 2016 the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available and is used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” to determine how to allocate resources and evaluate performance our codm makes business decisions based on segment revenues and operating profit segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses and facilities costs these shared expenses include delivery recruitment and development sales and marketing and support functions such as it finance legal and human resources generally shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense eg recorded hours or headcount certain expenses that are not controllable at the segment level are not allocated to specific segments 

our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments however in some specific cases managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team in such cases the client’s activity would be reported through that management team’s reportable segment 

segment revenues from external clients and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe russia and other reportable segments for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



north america segment 

2017  compared to 2016 

north america segment revenues increased 1539 million  or 240  over last year and remained consistent at 548  and 553  of total revenues for 2017 and 2016 respectively the north america segment’s operating profits increased 263 million  or 184  as compared to 2016  to 1693 million  north america’s operating profit represented 213  of north america segment revenues as compared to 223  in 2016 the media  entertainment financial services  emerging verticals each grew over 30 as compared to 2016 and in total represented 608 of the growth in north america segment revenues from 2016 

2016  compared to 2015 

north america segment revenues were 553 and 515 of total revenues representing an increase of 1706 million or 362 over 2015 the north america segment’s operating profits increased 307 million or 273 as compared to 2015 to 1430 million net operating profit north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 223 of north america segment’s revenues strong performance of our north america segment was predominantly driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships across all our key verticals as well as strong performance of the us dollar against foreign currencies 

europe segment 

our europe segment includes the business in the apac region which is managed by the same management team 

2017  compared to 2016 

europe segment revenues were 5932 million  representing an increase of 1182 million  or 249  from last year during the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  revenues from our europe segment were 408  and 409  of total segment revenues respectively during 2017  this segment’s operating profits increased 245 million  or 363  as compared to last year to 921 million  net operating profit the financial services vertical remained our largest vertical in this segment and grew 58 in 2017 as compared to 2016 over half of the growth in the europe segment was attributable to the travel  consumer and media  entertainment verticals 

2016  compared to 2015 

europe segment revenues were 4750 million representing an increase of 745 million or 186 from 2015 during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 revenues from our europe segment were 409 and 438 of total segment revenues respectively during 2016 this segment’s operating profits decreased 12 million or 17 as compared to 2015 to 675 million net operating profit 

during 2016 the segment’s operating results were adversely affected by a slowdown in growth of our top customer significantly increasing pressures on operating margins and overall profitability of the segment in january 2017 we announced a multiyear arrangement with this customer which extended our nineyear relationship and established a minimum revenue commitment of at least 300 million over the next three years 

the segment’s operating results were adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations and particularly the depreciation of the british pound relative to the us dollar which is the primary currency for the majority of the delivery centers that service our uk accounts the financial services vertical remained our largest vertical in this segment and accounted for 308 of the overall growth of this segment in 2016 

russia and other segments 

2017  compared to 2016 

revenues from our russia reportable segment increased 194 million  relative to 2016  operating profits of our russia segment increased 64 million  when compared to 2016  expressed as a percentage of revenues the russia segment’s operating profits were 221  and 173  in 2017 and 2016 respectively this growth is partially attributable to the strengthening of the russian ruble against the us dollar during 2017 as compared to 2016 ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in this region as well as significant volatility of the russian ruble impact this segment 

     2016  compared to 2015 

during 2016 we completed multiyear engagements with certain customers which significantly decreased the portfolio of accounts in our other reportable segment as a result managerial responsibility for the remaining accounts in the other reportable segment was transferred to our russia segment this change does not represent a change in our reportable segments but is rather a movement in responsibility for a number of customers accounting for less than 1 of total segment revenue 

revenues from our russia reportable segment increased 07 million relative to the revenues of our russia and other segments in 2015 operating profits of our russia segment increased 25 million when compared to the operating profits of our russia and other segments in 2015 expressed as a percentage of the russia and other segments’ revenues operating profits were 173 and 119 in 2016 and 2015 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

historically cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business at december 31 2017  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 5826 million  and 2737 million  of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

many of our operations are conducted outside the united states and as of december 31 2017  4335 million  of our total cash including time deposits and restricted cash was held internationally of this amount 2401 million  was held in cis countries and 1967 million  of this total was located in belarus banking and other financial systems in the cis region are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities in the cis region are not insured our subsidiaries in the cis and apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than us dollars 

all cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states except for 970 million  held in belarus are for future operating needs and we have no intention of repatriating those funds as part of our ongoing liquidity assessments we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows and cash balances and we may decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends 3245 million  including all of the total cash held in belarus would be subject to foreign withholding taxes we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be sufficient to fund our domestic operations and obligations for the foreseeable future 

on may 24 2017 we entered into a revolving credit facility with pnc bank national association pnc capital markets llc wells fargo bank national association santander bank na fifth third bank and citibank na to replace the former revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility provides for a borrowing capacity of 3000 million  with potential to increase the credit facility up to 4000 million  if certain conditions are met the revolving credit facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on may 24 2022  borrowings under the credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or up to a maximum of 1000 million  equivalent in british pounds sterling canadian dollars euros or swiss francs or other currencies as may be approved by the administrative agent and the lenders borrowings under the 2017 credit facility bear interest at either a base rate or eurorate plus a margin based on the company’s leverage ratio at december 31 2017  we had outstanding debt of 250 million  and unused letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility totaling 13 million  primarily for securing collateral requirements under certain insurance programs and office rent with the balance of the credit limit of 2737 million  remaining available for borrowing 

we were in compliance with all covenants in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  and anticipate being in compliance with all covenants for the foreseeable future 

our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate at which our cash flows increase or decrease and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

2017  compared to 2016 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2017  increased 305 million  or 185  to 1954 million  as compared to 2016  primarily driven by the 393 million  increase in income from operations the 743 million  increase in the provision for income taxes had minimal impact on cash flow as it was offset by a 705 million  increase in taxes payable primarily attributable to the us tax act which are expected to be paid over the next 8 years 

2016  compared to 2015 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2016 increased 884 million or 1157 to 1648 million as compared to 2015 the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher customer collections as we made substantial progress in managing our billed and unbilled trade receivables and decreased the ratio of billed and unbilled trade receivables to revenues over the course of 2016 

investing activities 

2017  compared to 2016 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2017  was 362 million  compared to 93 million  used in the same period in 2016  during 2017 the investing cash outflow was primarily attributed to capital expenditures of 298 million  and was consistent with capital expenditures of 293 million  in 2016 our capital expenditures during 2017 were driven by our continuous investment in facilities and computer equipment to support our increased headcount cash inflows during 2016 included a 300 million increase in cash upon maturity of certain time deposits while there were no material time deposit maturities during 2017 

2016  compared to 2015 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2016 was 93 million compared to 1255 million used in the same period in 2015 during 2016 cash spent on capital expenditures increased by 114 million which was more than offset by a 714 million decrease in cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2016 and a 595 million increase in net cash inflows as a result of movements in restricted cash and time deposits 

financing activities 

2017  compared to 2016 

during the year ended december 31 2017  net cash provided by financing activities was 497 million  representing a 393 million  increase from 105 million  cash provided by financing activities in 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from increased exercises of stock options issued under our longterm incentive plans during 2017 stock option exercises contributed 540 million  of cash compared to 180 million  during 2016 

2016  compared to 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was 105 million representing a 233 million decrease from 338 million cash provided by financing activities in 2015 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 451 million decrease related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility coupled with lower proceeds related to our longterm incentive plans this was partially offset by lower payments of deferred consideration related to acquisitions of businesses which decreased 280 million in 2016 compared to last year 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  





letters of credit 

at december 31 2017  we had two irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling 13 million under the 2017 credit facility which are required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies and office rent the letters of credit expire on april 27 2018 and august 20 2018 respectively with a possibility of automatic extension for an additional period of one year from the present or any future expiration date 

future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future however our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 15  “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks result primarily from concentrations of credit changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues 

we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we hold a significant balance of cash in banks in the cis countries where banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities in the cis region are not insured as of december 31 2017  2401 million  of total cash was held in banks in cis countries of which 1967 million  was held in belarus the cis banking sector remains subject to periodic instability and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards particularly in belarus a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the region which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition cash in other cis locations is used for shortterm operational needs and cash balances in those banks move with the needs of the entities 

accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across many clients operating in different industries therefore concentration of credit risk is limited as of december 31 2017  there were no  customers individually exceeding 10 of our billed trade receivables as of december 31 2017  unbilled trade receivables from one  customer individually exceeded 10 and accounted for 130  of our total unbilled trade receivables 

there were no  customers individually exceeding 10 of our total revenues as of december 31 2017  during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  the company had one  customer ubs ag  which contributed revenues including reimbursable expenses and other revenues of 1376 million  and 1302 million  respectively which accounted for more than 10 of total revenues in the periods indicated 

during the year ended   december 31 2017  our top five customers accounted for 240  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 339  of our total revenues during the year ended   december 31 2016  our top five customers accounted for 284  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 384  of our total revenues 

historically credit losses and writeoffs of trade accounts receivable balances have not been material to our consolidated financial statements however our results of operations depend on our ability to successfully collect payment from our clients for work performed 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is influenced by the changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalent deposits and paid on any outstanding balance on our borrowings mainly under our 2017 credit facility which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the type and timing of funds borrowed we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to these borrowings and deposits and we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates and therefore we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility 

foreign exchange risk 

our global operations are conducted predominantly in us dollars other than us dollars we generate a significant portion of our revenues in various currencies principally euros british pounds canadian dollars swiss francs and russian rubles and incur expenditures principally in hungarian forints russian rubles polish zlotys swiss francs british pounds indian rupees and chinese yuan renminbi associated with the location of our delivery centers 

our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in foreign currencies and cash outflows for expenditures in foreign currencies our results of operations primarily revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies can be affected if any of the currencies which we use materially in our business appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar additionally to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion 

during the year ended december 31 2017 foreign exchange losses decreased 88 million  to 32 million  compared to a 121 million  loss reported last year the improvement in foreign exchange impact was primarily driven by movements in exchange rates relative to local currencies in our foreign operations particularly russian rubles and british pounds 

management supplements results reported in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles referred to as gaap with nongaap financial measures management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating its performance when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared on the basis of “constant currency” which is a nongaap financial measure this measure excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we reported revenue growth of 250  had our consolidated revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during 2016 we would have reported revenue growth of 239  during 2017 revenues have benefited from the appreciation of the russian ruble and euro relative to the us dollar which was partially offset by the overall depreciation in british pounds relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2017 foreign currency fluctuation did not have a significant impact on our net income expressed in constant currency terms as we continue to be naturally diversified across locations and currencies in which we operate 

during the year ended december 31 2017  approximately 360  of consolidated revenues and 417  of operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2017  to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

our revenues by vertical for the periods presented are as follows 



clients 

our clients primarily consist of forbes global 2000 corporations located in north america europe asia and the cis we maintain a geographically diverse client base with 573  of our 2016  revenues from clients located in north america 355  from clients in europe 40  from clients in the cis and 21  from our clients in apac we typically enter into master services agreements with our clients which provide a framework for services that is then supplemented by statements of work which specify the particulars of each individual engagement including the services to be performed pricing terms and performance criteria 

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 962  and 819  of our revenues in 2016  coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively in addition we have significantly grown the size of existing accounts as a majority of our top client mix remains consistent over the years the annual revenue from our top five clients increased from 1072 million  in 2011 to 3271 million  in 2016  and the annual revenue from our top ten clients increased from 1491 million  in 2011 to 4423 million  in 2016  

during 2016  2015  and 2014   one  customer ubs ag  accounted for over 10 of our revenues 

the following table presents the percentage of our revenues by client location 

revenues by client location above differ from our segment information our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some specific cases however managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team in such a case the client’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment particularly our acquired clients in the apac region are reported as part of the europe segment based on the managerial responsibility for those clients the following table presents the percentage of our revenues by reportable segment

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as cee india and china we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings reputation and track record for highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to clients’ business needs scale financial stability and price 

we face competition primarily from 

 we believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions our technical employee base and the development and continuous improvement in process methodologies applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources may be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands may be able to devote greater resources towards the development promotion and sale of their services than we can and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients 

intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our clients we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us which assign to us all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential 

we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients these customary agreements cover our use of the clients’ software systems and platforms as our clients usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them furthermore we usually grant a perpetual worldwide royaltyfree nonexclusive transferable and nonrevocable license to our clients to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks relating to our business 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources 

we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business over the past several years both organically and through acquisitions we have also grown our support function headcount including finance legal and other areas our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure continued expansion increases the challenges we face in 

 moreover we intend to continue our expansion for the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological operational compliance and administrative risks and challenges and we may not be able to mitigate these risks and challenges to successfully grow those services or markets as a result of these problems associated with expansion we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth and our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to successfully attract train and retain new it professionals with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to those clients 

the ability to hire and retain highlyskilled information technology professionals is critical to our success to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business we must attract train and retain skilled it professionals including those with management experience competition for it professionals can be intense in the markets where we operate and accordingly we may not be able to hire or retain all of the it professionals necessary to meet our ongoing and future business needs consequently we may have to forgo projects due to lack of resources or inability to staff projects optimally 

 a significant increase in the attrition rate among it professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services in addition any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire it professionals to meet our business requirements 

increases in wages for our it professionals and other compensation expense could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wage costs for it professionals in cis cee and apac and certain other geographies in which we operate are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the service industry in these countries may increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our it professionals and increase the prices for our services increases in wage costs may reduce our profitability 

additionally we have granted certain equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and entered into other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past and expect to continue this practice the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness to us of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the value of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations the issuance of equitybased compensation also results in additional dilution to our stockholders 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted 

if any of our senior executives or key personnel such as business development managers joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients suppliers knowhow and key it professionals and staff members to them additionally there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge practices or procedures by such personnel if any dispute arises between our senior executives or key personnel and us any noncompetition nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key personnel might not provide effective protection to us especially in cis and cee countries where some of our senior executives and key employees reside in light of uncertainties with local legal systems 

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization and productivity levels 

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization levels of fixedcost resources such as our professionals as well as other resources such as computers and office space and our productivity levels we have expanded our operations significantly in recent years which has materially increased both our headcount and fixed overhead costs some of our it professionals are specially trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any client or on any project for which we have dedicated it professionals or facilities we may not be able to reallocate these it professionals and facilities to other clients and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks 

we are a global company with substantial international operations our revenues from clients outside north america represented 416  459  and 485  of our revenues excluding reimbursable expenses for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in the cis and cee the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks 

risks inherent in conducting international operations include 

 we earn our revenues and incur our expenses in multiple currencies which exposes us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues receivables compensation purchases and capital expenditures currency exchange volatility caused by political or economic instability or other factors could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

in june 2016 voters in the uk approved an exit from the european union “brexit” and as a result it is anticipated that the uk government will negotiate the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union short or long term effects of brexit may result in stock market and foreign currency exchange rate volatility and may also impact other operational areas of our business including immigration and mobility of our workforce we are monitoring the developments relating to brexit but the related uncertainty may affect our customers’ operations and may result in new operational and financial challenges for us 

the it services industry is particularly sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our clients may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate our clients and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which we operate regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for it services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified it professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled it professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks 

we have significant operations in cis and cee countries india and other asian countries which are generally considered to be emerging markets investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including foreign laws and regulations and the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions tax increases fluctuations in exchange rates inflation and unstable political and military situations and labor issues the economies of certain countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns moreover emerging markets have less established legal systems which can be characterized by gaps in regulatory structures selective enforcement of laws and limited judicial and administrative guidance on legislation among other limitations financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies could dampen foreign investment in these markets and materially adversely affect their economies such economic instability and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations may be adversely affected by ongoing conflict in ukraine 

continuing military activities in ukraine have combined with ukraine’s weak economic conditions to fuel ongoing economic uncertainty in ukraine russia and other markets in response to the actions in ukraine the eu united states canada japan switzerland and other nations have imposed and may continue imposing further economic sanctions including specific sanctions on certain russian entities specifically in the energy defense and financial sectors prolonged political instability in ukraine sanctions against russia and russia’s potential response to such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our operations we have delivery centers in the ukraine employing 4081  it professionals none of which are located in the most volatile regions of eastern ukraine we also have delivery centers in russia employing 2834  it professionals located in various cities including moscow and st petersburg to date we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our clients we continue to monitor the situation closely our contingency plans include relocating work andor personnel to other locations and adding new locations as appropriate 

we do not have longterm commitments from our clients and our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts a loss of business from significant clients could materially affect our results of operations 

our ability to maintain close relationships with our major clients is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific client is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our clients’ exclusive it services provider and we do not have longterm commitments from any clients to purchase our services the ability of our clients to terminate master services agreements and work orders with or without cause makes our future revenues uncertain as our clients are generally not obligated for any longterm commitments to us although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from clients who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end our failure to perform or observe any contractual obligations could also result in termination or nonrenewal of a contract as could a change of control of our company 

there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including a client’s 

 termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and thus compress our margins until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount the loss of any of our major clients or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them if not replaced by new client engagements could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our clients is concentrated in five specific industry verticals financial services software and hitech media and entertainment travel and consumer and life sciences and healthcare our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these five industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource it services 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes decreased demand for our services or increased pricing pressure on us from our clients in these key industries could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts assumptions and predictions about our projects the marketplace and global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract because of these inherent uncertainties we may underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we are not able to pass on to our clients increases in compensation cost whether driven by competition for talent or ordinarycourse pay increases or charge premium prices when justified by market demand or the type of service our profitability may suffer 

in addition a number of our contracts contain pricing terms that condition a portion of the payment of fees by the client on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules set forth in the contracts our failure to meet such performance goals service levels or completion schedules or our failure to meet client expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements 

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

to successfully perform larger and more complex projects we need to establish and maintain effective close relationships with our clients continue high levels of client satisfaction and develop a thorough understanding of our clients’ operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including 

 our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our management personnel and it professionals some of whom do not have experience managing largescale or complex projects in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements a failure by us to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business compress our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our it services which requires significant investment of human resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients’ decision to select another it service provider or inhouse resources to perform the services and the timing of our clients’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth for certain clients we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our current and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to whom we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could materially adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients weak or volatile macroeconomic and global financial system conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected moreover in the event of delays in payment from our governmental and quasigovernmental clients we may have difficulty collecting on receivables owed 

we face intense competition for clients and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services companies and increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

the market for it services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations clients tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other competing it services providers clients may prefer it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate 

current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore it services providers this shift away from offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our clients operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources than epam client buying patterns can change if clients become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers with less emphasis on quality therefore we may not be able to retain our clients while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

our ability to generate and retain business depends on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our service and our clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients and employees competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose clients and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in it services enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing client needs the process of developing our client solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with anticipate or respond to these changes is subject to a number of risks including that 

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our clients could materially adversely affect our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of business or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current clients and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of client data a failure to attract new clients or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our clients and us errors will not be found in new software product development solutions which could result in litigation other claims for damages against us as well as reputational harm and thus could materially adversely affect our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we have access to collect store process and transmit sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under applicable laws and regulatory penalties such a breach or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by such a breach or disruption any of these results could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by the disclosure of confidential information system failures or errors 

 if any person including any of our personnel misappropriates sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws some of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for certain occurrences including breaches of confidentiality and infringement indemnity furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief any such breach or misappropriation resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

a significant failure in our telecommunications or it infrastructure or systems could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenue and otherwise disrupt our business 

part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications financial control accounting customer service and other data processing systems between our clients’ offices our delivery centers and our client management locations moreover many of our key systems for corporate operations are internallydeveloped applications our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these internet it or communication systems which could be caused by among other things software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrading damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online or increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control internallydeveloped systems may not possess the same level of control security or support that traditional thirdparty systems and applications do loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenue or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

if we cause disruptions to our clients’ businesses or provide inadequate service our clients may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose clients have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

if our it professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our clients or fail to consistently meet service requirements of a client these errors or failures could disrupt the client’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us furthermore any errors by our employees in the performance of services for a client or poor execution of such services could result in a client terminating our engagement and seeking damages from us any failure in a client’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure the assertion of one or more large claims against us whether or not successful could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may invest substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

as our business grows we may invest in new facilities and physical infrastructure we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies do not perform to our expectations our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

part of our expansion strategy includes strategic acquisitions these transactions involve significant challenges including the risk that an acquisition does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve a satisfactory return on our investment that we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company’s employees client relationships and operations and that the transactions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and make it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties 

the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions 

if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including as a result of a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business 

our earnings could be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings from belarus cyprus ukraine the united kingdom and russia or such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we do not accrue incremental us taxes on all earnings in belarus cyprus ukraine the united kingdom and russia as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2016 these increased taxes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus and other countries to companies in our industry 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from belarusian income tax which as of the date of this annual report was 18 and from the value added tax for a period of 15 consecutive years effective july 1 2006 and taxed at other reduced rates on a variety of other taxes our subsidiary in russia benefits from a substantially reduced rate on social contributions and an exemption on value added tax in certain circumstances which is a benefit to qualified it companies in russia if these tax benefits are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — provision for income taxes” 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of some of our personnel or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

certain of our personnel are retained as independent contractors in several countries the criteria to determine whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary by jurisdiction as can the interpretation of the applicable laws if a government authority or court makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we classify our us employees as “exempt” or “nonexempt” under the federal labor standards act “flsa” and the flsa criteria for these classifications are subject to change from time to time if it were determined that any of our us employees should be classified as “nonexempt” under the flsa we may incur costs and liabilities for back wages unpaid overtime fines or penalties andor be subject to employee litigation 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses 

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources 

most of the agreements we have entered into with our clients require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate although to date no client has brought any claims against us for such failure our clients have the right to terminate these agreements as a result of such failure 

the banking and financial systems in less developed markets where we hold funds remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore in russia belarus and other cis countries bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in that region which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability as a result we might face significant legal liability and payment obligations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as that in the united states or other countries with more mature legal systems 

we require our employees and independent contractors to enter into written agreements with us upon the commencement of their relationship with us which assign to epam all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or engagement with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients and certain vendors thes e a greements may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our clients’ technologies tools and applications without paying us for doing so and our clients may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks 

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties 

we typically indemnify clients who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our clients redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property that such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our clients may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms in addition we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies 

further our current and former employees andor subcontractors could challenge our exclusive rights in the software they have developed in the course of their employment in russia and certain other countries in which we operate an employer is deemed to own the copyright in works created by its employees during the course and within the scope of their employment but the employer may be required to satisfy additional legal requirements in order to make further use and dispose of such works while we believe that we have complied with all such requirements and have fulfilled all requirements necessary to acquire all rights in software developed by our independent contractors andor subcontractors these requirements are often ambiguously defined and enforced as a result we cannot assure that we would be successful in defending against any claim by our current or former employees independent contractors andor subcontractors challenging our exclusive rights over the use and transfer of works those employees independent contractors andor subcontractors created or requesting additional compensation for such works 

parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential clients deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our clients against infringement claims in certain instances any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anticorruption laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

as a company with international operations we are subject to many laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and other laws concerning our international operations the fcpa’s foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions although varying in both scope and jurisdiction and not limited to transactions with government officials we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under us and other antibribery laws 

we have a compliance program with controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and similar sanctions laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of such program may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws 

antioutsourcing legislation and restrictions on immigration if adopted may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the majority of our employees are nationals of cis and cee countries some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our clients’ facilities which are sometimes located outside the cis cee the ability of our employees to work in necessary locations around the world depends on their ability to obtain the required visas and work permits and this process can be lengthy and difficult immigration laws are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions 

in addition the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues it is possible that pending legislation in the united states regarding offshore outsourcing may impose restrictions on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to client locations which could adversely impact our business it is generally difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or maintaining business visas for our employees however if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain work visas 

our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our clients on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

a recent us executive order titled “protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states” restricts entry into the united states of nonus nationals from a number of enumerated countries in the middle east and suspends a visa interview waiver program that was in place at us consulates worldwide while the travel restrictions do not extend to nationals of cis and cee countries it is possible that there could be delays in visa processing before cis and cee nationals can enter into the united states and their wait times for visa interviews may increase significantly wait times could also be impacted by a recently announced us federal government hiring freeze delays in the process to obtain visas may result in delays in the ability of our personnel to travel to meet with our clients provide services to our clients or to continue to provide services on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

similarly legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in european jurisdictions or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of services from an offshore location could also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to an it services provider or changes its current it services provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous it services provider are entitled to become employees of the new it services provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous it services provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other european union countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation could materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and european union and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and european union in a costeffective manner 

our cis subsidiaries can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements 

we operate in cis countries primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of other cis countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if the company fails to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation for any damages if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility and we can’t be certain that such additional financing would be available on terms acceptable to us the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations 

our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report 

revenues  — we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved at the time revenues are recognized we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms 

we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings which represent specific competencies of our it professionals contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements 

the majority of our revenues 882 of revenues in 2016 858 in 2015 and 847 in 2014 are generated under timeandmaterial contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future 

revenues from fixedprice contracts 104 of revenues in 2016 128 in 2015 and 136 in 2014 are determined using the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the client revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client the complexity and judgment of our estimation process and issues related to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent in the application of the proportional performance method of accounting could affect the amounts of revenue receivables and deferred revenue at each reporting period 

business combinations — we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805 “business combinations” we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain 

if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported to present information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends which in no case extends beyond one year from the acquisition date revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings 

goodwill and other intangible assets — the acquired assets typically include customer relationships trade names noncompetition agreements and workforce as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we assess goodwill for impairment as of october 31 st  of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value when conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment we use a threestep process the first step is to perform an optional qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances in performing this assessment we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business industry and market trends as well as the overall future financial performance of our reporting unit and future opportunities in the markets in which it operates if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value we are not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment we perform a second step for our reporting unit consisting of a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment this quantitative assessment requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value to its respective carrying value including goodwill as of the date of the impairment test the third step employed for our reporting unit if it fails the second step is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 

historically a significant portion of the purchase consideration was allocated to customer relationships in valuing customer relationships we typically utilize the multiperiod excess earnings method a form of the income approach the principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the aftertax cash flows attributable to the intangible asset only we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straightline method or if reliably determinable the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected discounted future cash flows amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives that are predominantly ranging on average from five to ten years we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 

we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified in assessing fair value we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges if the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 

accounting for income taxes — we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes we estimate separately our deferred tax assets related valuation allowances current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the us internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 

stockbased compensation  — equitybased compensation cost relating to the issuance of sharebased awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant which is expensed over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures equitybased awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately if factors change and we employ different assumptions stockbased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 

significant judgment is required in determining the adjustment to stockbased compensation expense for estimated forfeitures stockbased compensation expense in a period could be impacted favorably or unfavorably by differences between forfeiture estimates and actual forfeitures if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities we may be required to accelerate increase or cancel any remaining unvested stockbased compensation expense 

equitybased awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value based on the closing price of our stock at the end of each reporting period future stockbased compensation expense related to our liabilityclassified awards may increase or decrease as a result of changes in the market price for our stock adding to the volatility in our operating results as of december 31 2016 41 of outstanding equity awards were classified as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

recent accounting pronouncements 

from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standardssetting bodies that we adopt according to the various timetables the fasb specifies unless otherwise discussed below we believe the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows upon adoption 

stockbased compensation  — in march 2016 the fasb issued accounting guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payments we will adopt the various amendments of the new accounting guidance in the consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period ending march 31 2017 with an effective date of january 1 2017 we believe the new standard will cause volatility in our effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share due to the tax effects related to sharebased payments being recorded to the income statement rather than equity the volatility in future periods will depend on our stock price at the awards’ vesting dates geographical mix and tax rates in applicable jurisdictions as well as the number of awards that vest in each period while we are continuing to assess the impact of the new standard we currently expect to recognize approximately 001 and 005 benefit to the diluted eps for the first quarter and fiscal year 2017 respectively and approximately a 12 and 17 benefit to the effective tax rate for the same periods however the benefit realized from the adoption of this accounting standard could vary significantly given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future sharebased transactions 

revenue recognition  — in may 2014 the fasb issued new revenue recognition guidance to provide a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers under the new guidance an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services a fivestep model has been introduced for an entity to apply when recognizing revenue the new guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements and is effective january 1 2018 with early adoption permitted for january 1 2017 entities have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders’ equity we plan to adopt the new guidance effective january 1 2018 and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply 

we have performed a review of the requirements of the new revenue standard and are monitoring the activity of the fasb and the transition resource group as it relates to specific interpretive guidance we are currently reviewing customer contracts and are in the process of applying the fivestep model of the new standard to each contract category we have identified and will compare the results to our current accounting practices as well as assessing the enhanced disclosure requirements of the new guidance the new standard could change the amount and timing of revenue and costs recognized under certain arrangement types and could increase the administrative burden on our operations to properly account for customer contracts and provide the more expansive required disclosures we are also assessing pricing provisions contained in certain of our customer contracts these provisions represent variable consideration or may provide the customer with a material right potentially resulting in a different allocation of the transaction price than under the current guidance due to the complexity of certain of our contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contractspecific terms and vary in some instances we have not yet determined what effect the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements andor related disclosures and expect to further our assessment of the financial impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2017 

leases  — effective january 1 2019 we will be required to adopt the new guidance of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 842 leases  which will supersede asc topic 840 leases the new guidance requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months we have not yet completed the assessment of the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements or determined which transition method we will apply 

measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  — effective january 1 2020 we will be required to adopt the amended guidance on measurement of credit losses on financial instruments with early adoption permitted effective january 1 2019 the amendments in this update change how companies measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets the new expected credit loss model will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets including trade receivables that are in the scope of the update we have not yet completed the assessment of the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements or concluded on when we will adopt the standard 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 







revenues 

our revenues are derived primarily from providing software development services to our clients revenues include revenue from services as well as reimbursable expenses and other revenues which primarily consist of travel and entertainment costs that are chargeable to clients 

during the year ended december 31 2016  our revenues were 116 billion  growing 269  over the corresponding period last year total revenues in 2016  and 2015  included 125 million  and 95 million  of reimbursable expenses and other revenues respectively which increased 316  in 2016  as compared to 2015  but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues 

during 2015  our revenues grew 252  over 2014  from 7300 million  to 9141 million  the increase was attributable to a combination of factors including deeper penetration into existing customers and attainment of new customers both organically and through acquisitions in 2015  revenue from new customers was 457 million  primarily resulting from our acquisitions in 2015  and does not include new clients that are affiliates of existing customers whom we consider an expansion of existing business in addition total revenues in 2015  and 2014  included 95 million  and 84 million  of reimbursable expenses and other revenues respectively which increased by 131  in 2015  as compared to 2014  but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues 

we discuss below the breakdown of our revenue by client location service offering vertical contract type and client concentration 

revenues by client location 

our revenues are sourced from four geographic markets north america europe cis and apac we present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed revenue by client location is different from the revenue by reportable segment in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report segments are not based on the geographic location of the clients but instead they are based on the location of the management responsible for a particular client 

the following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

2016  compared to 2015   

during the year ended december 31 2016  revenues in our largest geography north america closed at 6646 million  growing 1795 million  or 370  from 4851 million  reported for the year ended december 31 2015  revenues from this geography accounted for 573  of total revenues in fiscal 2016  an increase of 42  from 531  reported in the corresponding period last year 

within north america we experienced strong growth across all verticals despite considerable market geopolitical and economic uncertainties each of the two verticals media and entertainment and life sciences and healthcare grew above 40 while emerging verticals and financial services grew 600  and 941  respectively in addition our traditionally strong software  hitech portfolio grew 273  which allowed us to keep this important segment at our strategic target of 20 of consolidated revenues 

we saw continued traction with customers in the pharmaceutical segment of our life sciences and healthcare vertical and significantly grew our portfolio of customers in emerging verticals with over 30 growth in revenues there coming from customers who have been with us less than one year combined growth in our software  hitech and media  entertainment verticals accounted for 484 of the overall growth in the north america geography of which 193 million or 223 was attributable to the expansion of existing relationship with certain longstanding customers within our media and entertainment vertical 

revenues in our europe geography were 4121 million  an increase of 596 million  or 169  over 3525 million  reported last year revenues in this geography accounted for 355  of consolidated revenues in 2016 as compared to 386  last year the slowdown in revenue growth in 2016  was largely attributable to decelerated growth in revenues from our top customer in this geography coupled with increased internal and external pressures on customers within our travel and consumer vertical and currency headwinds primarily due to the depreciation of the british pound relative to the us dollar 

consistent with results in our north america geography europe experienced strong growth in the media and entertainment life sciences and healthcare and emerging verticals each of which grew over 48 during fiscal 2016 over 40 of growth in life sciences and healthcare and emerging verticals came from customers who have been with us less than one year financial services remained our largest vertical in this geography and accounted for 334 of the overall growth in 2016 

revenues in the cis geography showed an increase of 30 million  or 69  from last year the increase in cis revenues came predominantly from customers within the financial services and travel and consumer verticals ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region as well as significant volatility of the russian ruble limit revenue growth in this geography 

2015  compared to 2014   

during the year ended december 31 2015 revenues in our largest geography north america closed at 4851 million growing 1176 million or 320 as compared with the year ended december 31 2014 expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues the north america geography accounted for 531 in 2015 which represented an increase of 27 over 2014 the increase was primarily a result of growth in business from several of our top clients as well as new revenue from the acquisition of navigationarts llc and alliance consulting global holdings inc 

revenues from all major verticals in north america grew during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared with the year ended december 31 2014 the largest contributor to revenue growth in north america was its travel and consumer vertical which increased 329 million or 486 as compared with the year ended december 31 2014 the increase in this vertical was primarily driven by the rapid expansion of our strategic relationship with a large retail chain a relationship we acquired in 2012 

our life sciences and healthcare vertical in north america continued its impressive growth since we acquired new clients in the healthcare insurance and life sciences industries in one of our 2014 acquisitions and created synergies with existing customers in those markets combined revenue growth from customers in this vertical accounted for 290 million representing the largest percentage growth of all north americas verticals at 759 growth over prior year 

revenues from the media and entertainment vertical in north america increased by 253 million or 362 as compared with the year ended december 31 2014 the growth in this vertical in 2015 was attributable to resumed growth in revenues from certain longtime major customers who had decreased demand for our services in prior years 

north america’s largest vertical software and hitech experienced growth of 245 million or 172 during the year 

the financial services vertical remained our dominant vertical in the european geography in 2015 revenues from the financial services vertical increased by 283 million or 190 respectively over the corresponding period of 2014 continued solid performance of the financial services vertical was attributable to an increased demand for our services and ongoing relationships with existing top customers located in europe we experienced increased business from our top customer located in switzerland who was responsible for the majority of the revenue growth in the financial services vertical during 2015 as compared with the year ended december 31 2014 furthermore we continue to see growing demand for our services from europeanbased customers within the travel and consumer vertical during the year ended december 31 2015 revenues from this vertical increased by 240 million as compared with the year ended december 31 2014 and accounted for 355 of total growth in this geography during period indicated europe’s software and hitech vertical experienced a significant increase of 665 in 2015 compared to 2014 in part due to business from a new significant customer in germany engaged in 2015 

revenues in the cis geography showed a decrease of 128 million or 229 on a yeartodate basis compared to 2014 the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decline in the financial services vertical which was significantly impacted by the microeconomic situation in the region additionally significant foreign currency fluctuations in russia and cis countries had a material negative impact on the revenues from those locations 

revenues by service offering 

our endtoend service offerings are grouped into five main categories with software development representing our core competency and a substantial majority of our business the following table sets forth revenues by service offering by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

revenues by vertical 

we analyze our revenue by separating our clients into five main industry sectors or verticals as detailed in the following table also we serve clients in other industries such as oil and gas telecommunications and several others which are reported in aggregate under emerging verticals 

the following table sets forth revenues by vertical by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

revenues by contract type 

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice arrangements our engagement models depend on the type of services provided to a client the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve historically the vast majority of our revenues have been generated under timeandmaterial contracts under timeandmaterial contracts we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly daily or monthly rates fixedprice contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on preagreed intervals we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future 

the following table sets forth revenues by contract type by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

revenues by client concentration 

the following table sets forth revenues contributed by our top one top five and top ten clients by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

during the year ended december 31 2016  our growth rate outside the top twenty accounts was 443  while the top twenty accounts grew 125  while we seek to grow revenues from our existing clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements we expect client concentration from our top ten clients to continue to decrease over the longterm 

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 962  and 819  of our revenues in 2016  coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively we have longstanding relationship with many of our customers and revenues derived from these customers may fluctuate as these accounts reach their maturity or upon completion of multiyear projects while we believe there’s a significant potential for future growth as we expand our capabilities and offerings within specific domains verticals we continue to focus on diversification of our client concentration and building up a portfolio of accounts that we believe have significant revenue potential we anticipate the contribution of these accounts to our total revenues to increase in the mid to longterm and counterbalance the slowdown in the growth of certain of our largest customers as they reach maturity 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries employee benefits stockbased compensation expense travel costs and subcontractor fees for it professionals and subcontractors that are assigned to client projects salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are reported as cost of revenue regardless of whether the employees are actually performing client services during a given period 

we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through strategically hiring and training highperforming it professionals and efficiently staffing projects our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services some of our it professionals are specifically hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or projects 

2016 compared to 2015 

during the years ended december 31 2016  cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 7372 million  representing an increase of 300  from 5669 million  reported in the corresponding period last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 342  growth in the average number of production headcount for the year 

expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 636  and 620  during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively of this increase 15 was attributable to a decrease in utilization during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period last year while we will continue to strategically invest in our business to support its longterm growth we anticipate utilization to reach normalized levels in 2017 

2015 compared to 2014 

during the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 5669 million and 4565 million respectively representing an increase of 242 for the year ended december 31 2015 over the corresponding period of 2014 mainly due to an increase in headcount of revenueproducing personnel 

the increase in cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization in 2015 was primarily driven by an increase 1071 million in compensation costs for revenueproducing personnel including an increase in stockbased compensation expense of 50 million the increases in all of these costs were the result of organic increase in headcount as well as personnel additions from acquisitions 

as a percentage of revenues cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased 05 over the corresponding period of 2014 to 620 of consolidated revenues 

selling general and administrative expenses

over the recent years our selling general and administrative expenses have been increasing as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues 

2016 compared to 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2016  selling general and administrative expenses were 2647 million  representing an increase of 188  as compared to 2228 million  reported in the corresponding period last year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2016  was primarily driven by a 146 million  increase in personnelrelated costs coupled with a 165 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to investment in facilities and infrastructure to support the increased headcount and 40 million higher spending related to talent acquisition and development 

expressed as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased 16  to 228  for the year ended december 31 2016  the decrease was primarily attributable to higher revenue growth as compared to the growth in compensation driven by the increased headcount and wage inflation coupled with relatively limited growth in stockbased compensation 

2015 compared to 2014 

we continued to invest in key areas including sales infrastructure industry expertise and other functions supporting global operations and our growth during the year ended december 31 2015 selling general and administrative expenses totaled 2228 million representing an increase of 361 from 1637 million during 2014 as a percentage of revenue selling general and administrative expenses represent 244 of consolidated revenues an increase of 20 over last year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2015 was primarily driven by a 485 million increase in personnelrelated costs which includes salaries and stockbased compensation expenses of these personnelrelated costs stockbased compensation expenses increased 162 million during the year ended december 31 2015 our selling general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth

during the year ended december 31 2016  depreciation and amortization expense was 234 million  representing an increase of 60 million  from 174 million  reported in the corresponding period last year the increase was predominantly driven by depreciation of computer equipment and infrastructure related to increased headcount and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisitions of businesses completed in 2015 expressed as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense was 20  a slight increase from 19  reported in the same period last year 

depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of acquired intangible assets all of which have finite useful lives

interest and other income net was 47 million in 2015 representing a slight decrease of 08 from 48 million recognized in 2014 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2016  2015  and 2014 we had 1358 million  1138 million  and 942 million  respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions the statutory tax rate in the majority of our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory us tax rate additionally we have secured special tax benefits in belarus as described below as a result our provision for income taxes is relatively low as a percentage of income before taxes because of the benefit received from income earned in low tax jurisdictions changes in the geographic mix or level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot provide assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18 the “on hightechnologies park” decree which created the belarus hitech park is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1 2006 the aggregate dollar benefits derived from this tax holiday approximated 136 million 208 million and 168 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the benefit the tax holiday had on diluted net income per share approximated 026 040 and 034 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

2016 compared to 2015 

provision for income taxes was 272 million  in 2016  and 216 million  in 2015  the increase in the effective tax rate from 204  in 2015  to 215  in 2016  was predominantly caused by the changes in the geographic mix of our earnings including 

 as we continue to grow our onsite presence and expand the geographic footprint of our delivery centers we expect this may result in an increase to our effective tax rate in the near and medium term but other factors that may contribute favorably or unfavorably to the overall effective tax rate in 2017 and beyond must be considered as well 

2015 compared to 2014 

provision for income taxes was 216 million  in 2015 and 173 million  in 2014 the effective tax rate increased to 204  in 2015 from 199  in 2014 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our current year earnings and discrete tax benefits recorded in 2014 that didn’t recur in 2015 as well as due to elimination of certain income tax holiday benefits in hungary in 2015 

foreign exchange gain  loss 

for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign exchange risk” 

effects of inflation 

economies in cis countries particularly belarus russia kazakhstan and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries and as a result decrease demand for our services and negatively impact the business of our existing clients inflation is likely to increase some of our expenses which may reduce our profitability as we may not be able to pass these increases on to our clients generally our largest expense that could be impacted by inflation is wages we do not rely on borrowed funds for operations in those locations therefore increases in interest rates typical for inflationary environments do not currently pose a risk to our business 

ukraine has been experiencing political and economic turmoil severely impacting the ukrainian economy the ukrainian currency has been weakened and the negative outlook in the ukrainian economy continues we have not experienced a significant impact from the inflation in ukraine and do not have significant clients located in ukraine 

inflation in russia increased in late 2014 due to weakening of the russian ruble and decreasing oil prices inflation in russia remained steady during 2015 with some decline observed during 2016 our operations in russia have not been significantly affected by local inflation however we have noted some impact from inflation on our clients in russia 

belarus experienced hyperinflation in the past and may experience high levels of inflation in the future we have not seen a significant impact from the inflation in belarus as our largest expense there wages is denominated in us dollars in order to provide stability in our business and for our employees we do not have significant clients located in belarus and for the year ended december 31 2016  we had approximately 1743  or 02  of our revenues denominated in belarusian rubles the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in belarus is us dollars 

other locations where we have clients or perform services are not experiencing significant inflation and our business is not materially impacted by inflation in those locations 

results by business segment 

our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available that is used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some specific cases however managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team in a case like this the client’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment our codm evaluates the company’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit 

segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each reportable segment have similar characteristics and are subject to similar factors pressures and challenges expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses we use globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources as a result a majority of our expenses is shared by all segments these shared expenses include delivery recruitment and development sales and marketing and support functions such as it finance legal and human resources generally shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense eg recorded hours or headcount however certain expenses are not allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by codm accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against our total income from operations 

revenues from external clients and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe russia and other reportable segments for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



north america segment 

2016  compared to 2015 

north america segment revenues were 553  and 515  of total revenues representing an increase of 1706 million  or 362  over the corresponding period last year the north america segment’s operating profits increased 307 million  or 273  as compared to the same period of 2015  to 1430 million  net operating profit north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 223  of north america segment’s revenues 

strong performance of our north america segment was predominantly driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships across all our key verticals as well as strong performance of the us dollar against foreign currencies 

2015  compared to 2014 

during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  revenues from our north america segment were 515  and 513  of total revenues representing an increase of 971 million  or 259  over the corresponding period in 2014  the north america segment’s operating profits increased by 217 million  or 239  as compared to the same period of 2014  to 1123 million  net operating profit north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 238  of revenues 

the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships as well as our recent acquisitions operating results of the north america reportable segment benefited from our 2014 acquisitions in the life sciences and healthcare industry as well as acquisitions of navigationarts and ags during 2015 

europe segment 

our europe segment includes the business in the apac region which is managed by the same management team 

2016  compared to 2015 

europe segment’s revenues were 4750 million representing an increase of 745 million or 186 from last year during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  revenues from our europe segment were 409  and 438  of total segment revenues respectively during 2016  this segment’s operating profits decreased 12 million  or 17  as compared to the corresponding period last year to 675 million  net operating profit 

during 2016 the segment’s operating results were adversely affected by a slowdown in growth of our top customer significantly increasing pressures on operating margins and overall profitability of the segment in january 2017 we announced a multiyear arrangement with this customer which extended our nineyear relationship and established a minimum revenue commitment of at least 300 million over the next three years 

the segment’s operating results were adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations and particularly the depreciation of the british pound relative to the us dollar which is the primary currency for the majority of the delivery centers that service our uk accounts the financial services vertical remained our largest vertical in this segment and accounted for 308  of the overall growth of this segment in 2016 

2015  compared to 2014 

during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  revenues from our europe segment were 438  and 410  of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 1012 million  or 338  in 2015  over the 2014  results during 2015  the europe segment’s operating profits increased by 185 million  or 369  as compared to the corresponding period of 2014  to 687 million  net profit from the segment’s operations 

europe continues to be a growing segment in our portfolio as our business model continues to gain considerable traction with europeanbased clients primarily in the financial services and travel and consumer verticals furthermore our europe segment benefited from the continued growth of jointech a company we acquired in 2014 with locations in southeast asia this extended reach into a new geography created additional options for our existing customers within the financial services vertical particularly in the areas of investment banking and wealth and asset management we continue to expect that our new and existing customers will use our services in that fastgrowing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment 

russia and other segments 

2016  compared to 2015 

during fiscal 2016 we completed multiyear engagements with certain customers which significantly decreased the portfolio of accounts in our other reportable segment as a result managerial responsibility for the remaining accounts in the other reportable segment was transferred to our russia segment this change does not represent a change in our reportable segments but is rather a movement in responsibility for a number of customers accounting for less than 1 of total segment revenue 

revenues from our russia reportable segment increased 07 million  relative to the revenues of our russia and other segments in the corresponding period of 2015  operating profits of our russia segment increased 25 million  when compared to the operating profits of our russia and other segments in the corresponding period of 2015  expressed as a percentage of the russia and other segments revenues operating profits were 173  and 119  in 2016 and 2015 respectively ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the region as well as significant volatility of russian ruble limit growth of this segment 

     2015  compared to 2014 

during the years ended december 31 2015  revenues from the russia and the other reportable segments decreased by 127 million  and 06 million  respectively over the corresponding period of 2014  operating profits of the russia segment decreased 18 million  and the operating losses of the other segment decreased 31 million  when compared with the operating profitslosses of these segments in the corresponding period of 2014  

revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments causing instability of revenues and associated profits additionally strong foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 further destabilized the economic situation in the regions that are included in these segments and negatively impacted our business in russia and cis countries during 2015 since 2014 the united states and the european union have imposed sanctions targeting russian government and governmentcontrolled interests and certain government officials while this has not directly impacted our business in russia the sanctions aggravated the overall russian economy and negatively influenced the business of our major clients in the region decreasing demand for our services 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

at december 31 2016  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 3620 million  and 741 million  of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

at december 31 2016  3102 million  of our total cash was held outside the united states of this amount 1536 million  was held in us dollar denominated accounts in belarus which include some interest bearing deposits as of december 31 2016  a balance of 291 million  us dollars was kept in unrestricted accounts in our cyprus entity’s bank accounts in the united kingdom our subsidiaries in the cis and apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than us dollars 

the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds however as a result of various factors such as any global or regional instability or changes in tax laws in place for a specific time period we may later decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends 3073 million  would be subject to foreign withholding taxes of which 2417 million  would also be subject to us corporate income tax we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flows increase our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside of the us and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions 

on september 12 2014 we executed a revolving credit facility with pnc bank national association santander bank na and silicon valley bank with a borrowing capacity of 1000 million  the revolving credit facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on september 12 2019  there is potential to increase the credit facility up to 2000 million  if certain conditions are met borrowings under the credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or up to a maximum of 500 million  in british pounds sterling canadian dollars euros or swiss francs or other currencies as may be approved by the lenders at december 31 2016  we had outstanding debt of 250  million and unused letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility totaling 09 million  primarily for securing collateral requirements under certain insurance programs with the balance of the credit limit of 741 million  remaining available for borrowing 

we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants and limitations in the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  and anticipate being in compliance with all restrictive covenants for the foreseeable future 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

2016  compared to 2015 

net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2016  increased 884 million  or 1157  to 1648 million  as compared to the corresponding period in 2015  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher customer collections as we made substantial progress in managing our billed and unbilled trade receivables and decreased the ratio of billed and unbilled trade receivables to revenues over the course of 2016 for 2017 we anticipate the ratio to remain relatively consistent with the second half of 2016 

2015  compared to 2014 

net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31 2015  decreased 285 million  to 764 million  as compared to 1049 million  net cash provided by operations in 2014  during 2015  operating cash flows were impacted by increases in billed and unbilled accounts receivable and greater accrued expenses which were mostly impacted by increases in bonus compensation during 2015  we had higher accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances as compared to the same period in 2014  

investing activities 

2016  compared to 2015 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2016  was 93 million  compared to 1255 million  used in the same period in 2015  during fiscal 2016 cash spent on capital expenditures increased by 114 million which was more than offset by a 714 million  decrease in cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2016 coupled with a 595 million  increase as a result of movements in restricted cash and time deposits 

2015  compared to 2014 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2015  was 1255 million  and consisted primarily of a 300 million interest bearing time deposit set up by our cyprus entity in the united kingdom in march 2015 and 769 million  net cash used in the business combinations with navigationarts and ags the cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2015 increased by 398 million  compared to 2014  

financing activities 

2016  compared to 2015 

during the year ended december 31 2016  net cash provided by financing activities was 105 million  representing a 233 million  decrease from 338 million  cash provided by financing activities in 2015 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 451 million decrease related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility coupled with lower proceeds related to our longterm incentive plans this was partially offset by lower payments of deferred consideration related to acquisitions of businesses which decreased 280 million  in 2016 compared to last year 

2015  compared to 2014 

net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2015  was 338 million  a decrease of 234 million  from the same period in 2014  primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of 30 million  as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stockbased compensation partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  





letter of credit 

at december 31 2016  we had an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount 09 million  under the revolving credit facility which is required to secure commitments for certain insurance policies the letter of credit expires on april 27 2017 with a possibility of automatic extension for an additional period of one year from the present or any future expiration date no  amounts were outstanding against this letter of credit during the year ended december 31 2016  

future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future our ability to generate cash however is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 16   in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and concentration of credit risks in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues 

we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we hold a significant balance of cash in banks in the cis countries where banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities in the cis region are not insured as of december 31 2016  1946 million  of total cash was held in banks in cis countries with 1538 million  of that in belarus and 186 million  in russia the cis banking sector remains subject to periodic instability and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards particularly in belarus a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis region which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition cash in other cis locations is used for shortterm operational needs and cash balances in those banks move with the needs of the entities 

trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across our clients in proportion to their revenues as of december 31 2016  unbilled trade receivables from two  customers individually exceeded 10 and accounted for 222  of our total unbilled trade receivables there were no  customers individually exceeding 10 of our billed trade receivables as of december 31 2016  

during the year ended   december 31 2016  our top five customers accounted for 282  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 381  of our total revenues during the year ended   december 31 2015  our top five customers accounted for 326  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 438  of our total revenues 

during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  the company had one  customer ubs ag  which contributed revenues of 1365 million  and 1298 million  respectively which accounted for more than 10 of total revenues in the periods indicated 

historically credit losses and writeoffs of trade accounts receivable balances have not been material to our consolidated financial statements   

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is mainly influenced by the changes in interest rates received on our cash and cash equivalent deposits and paid on any outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the type and timing of funds borrowed 

as of december 31 2016  we have borrowed under our revolving credit facility and have outstanding debt of 250 million  the interest rate for this debt is based on libor which resets regularly at issuance based on lending terms we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to this borrowing 

we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates and we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility however our future interest expense may increase and interest income may fall due to changes in market interest rates 

foreign exchange risk 

our global operations are conducted predominantly in us dollars other than us dollars we generate a significant portion of our revenues in various currencies principally euros british pounds canadian dollars swiss francs and russian rubles and incur expenditures principally in hungarian forints russian rubles polish zlotys swiss francs british pounds indian rupees and china yuan renminbi “cny” associated with our delivery centers 

our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in these foreign currencies and cash outflows for expenditures in foreign currencies our results of operations primarily revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies can be affected if any of the currencies which we use materially in our business appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar additionally to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion 

during the year ended december 31 2016 foreign exchange losses increased 75 million to 121 million compared to a 46 million loss reported in the corresponding period last year the increase in the reported loss in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by unfavorable movements of the british pound for the year ended december 31 2016 the british pound fell 163 relative to the us dollar with significant depreciation following the june 2016 referendum in which voters in the united kingdom approved an exit from the european union the depreciation of the british pound adversely affected the value of our monetary assets denominated in british pounds as well as the us dollarequivalent of the british pounddenominated revenues during the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 36 of consolidated revenues and 40 of operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than us dollar we are monitoring the developments relating to brexit as we have a significant operating presence in the uk and collect revenues and incur expenses in currencies that may be affected 

management supplements results reported in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles referred to as gaap with nongaap financial measures management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally for managing our business and evaluating its performance when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared on the basis of “constant currency” which is a nongaap financial measure this measure excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 

during the year ended december 31 2016 we reported revenue growth of 269 had our consolidated revenues been expressed in constant currency terms using the exchange rates in effect during fiscal 2015 we would have reported revenue growth of 294 the decrease in revenues expressed in constant currency terms was primarily related to the depreciation of the british pound relative to the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2016 foreign currency fluctuation did not have a significant impact on our net income expressed in constant currency terms as we continue to be naturally diversified across locations and currencies in which we operate

our revenues by vertical for the periods presented are as follows 



clients 

our clients primarily consist of forbes global 2000 corporations located in north america europe asia and the cis we maintain a geographically diverse client base with 531  of our 2015  revenues from clients located in north america 386  from clients in europe 47  from clients in the cis and 26  from our clients in apac we typically enter into master services agreements with our clients which provide a framework for services that is then supplemented by statements of work which specify the particulars of each individual engagement including the services to be performed pricing terms and performance criteria 

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 951  and 843  of our revenues in 2015  coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively in addition we have significantly grown the size of existing accounts as majority of our top client mix remains consistent over the years the annual revenue from our top five clients increased from 659 million in 2010 to 2981 million  in 2015 and the annual revenue from our top ten clients increased from 945 million in 2010 to 4003 million  in 2015 

during 2015  and 2014  one  customer ubs ag  accounted for over 10 of our revenues no customer accounted for over 10 of our revenues in 2013  

the following table presents the percentage of our revenues by client location 

revenues by client location above differ from our segment information our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some specific cases however managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team in such a case the client’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment particularly our acquired clients in the apac region are reported as part of the europe segment based on the managerial responsibility for those clients the following table presents the percentage of our revenues by reportable segment 

see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report for additional information regarding segments

we provide training continuing education and career development programs for both entrylevel and experienced it professionals entrylevel it professionals undergo a rigorous training program that consists of approximately three to six months of classroom training as well as numerous hours of handson training through actual engagements this comprehensive program results in employees who are highly proficient and possess deep technical expertise that enables them to immediately serve our clients’ needs for our midlevel and senior it professionals we offer continuing education programs aimed at helping them advance in their careers we also provide mentoring opportunities management and soft skills training intensive workshops and management and technical advancement programs we are committed to systematically identifying and nurturing the development of middle and senior management through formal leadership training evaluation development and promotion 

quality and process management 

over the years we have invested significant resources into developing a proprietary suite of internal applications and tools to manage all aspects of our delivery process these applications and tools are effective in reducing costs and security risks while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our clients in addition these applications tools methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions to global clients further strengthening our relationships with them

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as cee india and china we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings reputation and track record for highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to clients’ business needs scale financial stability and price 

we face competition primarily from 

 we believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions our technical employee base and the development and continuous improvement in process methodologies applications and tools position us well to compete 

effectively in the future our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources may be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands may be able to devote greater resources towards the development promotion and sale of their services than we can and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients 

intellectual property 

protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our clients we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us which assign to us all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential 

we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients these customary agreements cover our use of the clients’ software systems and platforms as our clients usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them furthermore we usually grant a perpetual worldwide royaltyfree nonexclusive transferable and nonrevocable license to our clients to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks relating to our business 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources 

we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business over the past several years both organically and through acquisitions we have also grown our support function headcount including finance legal and other areas our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure continued expansion increases the challenges we face in 

 moreover we intend to continue our expansion for the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological operational compliance and administrative risks and challenges and we may not be able to mitigate these risks and challenges to successfully grow those services or markets as a result of these problems associated with expansion we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth and our business prospects financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our failure to successfully attract train and retain new it professionals with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to those clients 

the ability to hire and retain highlyskilled information technology professionals is critical to our success to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business we must attract train and retain skilled it professionals including experienced management it professionals competition for it professionals can be intense in the markets where we operate and accordingly we may not be able to hire or retain all of the it professionals necessary to meet our ongoing and future business needs consequently we may have to forgo projects due to lack of resources or inability to staff projects optimally 

 a significant increase in the attrition rate among it professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services in addition any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire it professionals to meet our business requirements 

increases in wages for our it professionals and other compensation expense could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wage costs for it professionals in cis cee and apac and certain other geographies in which we operate are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the service industry in these countries may increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our it professionals as well as the prices we can charge for our services increases in wage costs may reduce our profitability 

additionally we have granted certain equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and entered into certain other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past and expect to continue this practice the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness to us of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the value of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations the issuance of equitybased compensation would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted 

if any of our senior executives or key personnel such as business development managers joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients suppliers knowhow and key it professionals and staff members to them additionally there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge practices or procedures by such personnel if any dispute arises between our senior executives or key personnel and us any noncompetition nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key personnel might not provide effective protection to us especially in cis and cee countries where some of our senior executives and key employees reside in light of uncertainties with legal systems in cis and cee countries 

  our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks 

we are a global company with substantial international operations our revenues from clients outside north america represented 459  485  and 478  of our revenues excluding reimbursable expenses for 2015  2014  and 2013  the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in the cis and cee the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks 

risks inherent in conducting international operations include 

• foreign exchange fluctuations 

• application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export 

• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights 

• complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 

• potentially adverse tax consequences 

• tariffs quotas and other trade protection measures 

• competition from companies with more experience in a particular country or with international operations 

• potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 

• overall foreign policy and variability of foreign economic conditions 

we earn our revenues and incur our expenses in multiple currencies which exposes us to foreign exchange risks relating to revenues receivables compensation purchases and capital expenditures currency exchange volatility caused by political or economic instability or other factors could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” the it services industry is particularly sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies further weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our clients may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate our clients and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which we operate regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for it services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified it professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled it professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks 

we have significant operations in cis and cee countries india and other asian countries which are generally considered to be emerging markets investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including foreign laws and regulations and the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions tax increases fluctuations in exchange rates inflation and unstable political and military situations and labor issues the economies of certain countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns moreover emerging markets have less established legal systems which can be characterized by gaps in regulatory structures selective enforcement of laws and limited judicial and administrative guidance on legislation among other limitations financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies could dampen foreign investment in these markets and materially adversely affect their economies such economic instability and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations may be adversely affected by ongoing conflict in ukraine 

continuing military activities in ukraine have combined with ukraine’s weak economic conditions to fuel ongoing uncertainty in ukraine russia and other markets in response to the actions in ukraine the eu united states canada japan switzerland and other nations have imposed and may continue imposing further economic sanctions including specific sanctions on certain russian entities specifically in the energy defense and financial sectors restored stability of ukraine’s political and economic conditions may not occur for some time and there could be increased violence or economic distress in ukraine or other areas in the region 

we have delivery centers in the ukraine employing approximately 3734  it professionals none of which are located in the most volatile regions of eastern ukraine we also have delivery centers in russia employing approximately 2235  it professionals located in various cities including moscow and st petersburg to date we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity needed to support our clients we continue to monitor the situation closely our contingency plans include relocating work or personnel to other locations and adding new locations as appropriate we have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation as the political and civil unrest and reported military activities are fluid and beyond our control prolonged political instability in ukraine sanctions against russia and russia’s potential response to such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we do not have longterm commitments from our clients and our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts a loss of business from significant clients could materially affect our results of operations 

our ability to maintain close relationships with our major clients is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific client is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our clients’ exclusive it services provider and we do not have longterm commitments from any clients to purchase our services the ability of our clients to terminate master services agreements and work orders with or without cause makes our future revenues uncertain as our clients are generally not obligated for any longterm commitments to us although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from clients who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end our failure to perform or observe any contractual obligations could also result in termination or nonrenewal of a contract as could a change of control of our company 

there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including a client’s 

 termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and an increase in our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount the loss of any of our major clients or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them if not replaced by new client engagements could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our clients is concentrated in five specific industry verticals financial services software and hitech media and entertainment travel and consumer and life sciences and healthcare our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these five industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource it services 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example a worsening of economic conditions in the financial services industry or significant consolidation in any of these industries may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes decreased demand for our services or increased pricing pressure on us from our clients in these key industries could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts assumptions and predictions about our projects the marketplace and global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform may include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract because of these inherent uncertainties we may underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we are not able to pass on to our clients increases in compensation cost whether driven by competition for talent or ordinarycourse pay increases or charge premium prices when justified by market demand or the type of service our profitability may suffer 

in addition a number of our contracts contain pricing terms that condition a portion of the payment of fees by the client on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules set forth in the contracts our failure to meet such performance goals service levels or completion schedules or our failure to meet client expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements 

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization levels and productivity levels 

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization levels of fixedcost resources including human resources as well as other resources such as computers and office space and our ability to increase our productivity levels we have expanded our operations significantly in recent years which has materially increased both our headcount and fixed overhead costs some of our it professionals are specially trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any client or on any project for which we have dedicated it professionals or facilities we may not be able to reallocate these it professionals and facilities to other clients and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer 

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

to successfully perform larger and more complex projects we need to establish and maintain effective close relationships with our clients continue high levels of client satisfaction and develop a thorough understanding of our clients’ operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including 

 15 

 our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our management personnel and it professionals some of whom do not have experience managing largescale or complex projects in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements a failure by us to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business compress our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our it services which requires significant investment of human resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients’ decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other it services providers or inhouse resources and the timing of our clients’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and hinder our revenue growth for certain clients we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our clients may experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology thereby further delaying the implementation process our current and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to whom we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could materially adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients weak or volatile macroeconomic and global financial system conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected moreover in the event of delays in payment from our governmental and quasigovernmental clients we may have difficulty collecting on receivables owed 

we face intense competition for clients and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services companies and increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

the market for it services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations clients tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other competing it services providers clients may prefer it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some of the emerging markets in which we operate 

current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore it services providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore it services provider this shift away from offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our clients operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources than epam client buying patterns can change if clients become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers with less emphasis on quality therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our clients while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

our ability to generate and retain business depends on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our service and our clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose clients and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in it services enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing client needs the process of developing our client solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with anticipate or respond to changes in technology methodology and business is subject to a number of risks including that 

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our clients could cause us to lose clients and materially adversely affect our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our services or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current clients and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of client data a failure to attract new clients or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our clients and us errors will not be found in new software product development solutions which could result in litigation other claims for damages against us as well as reputational harm and thus could materially adversely affect our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we have access to collect store process and transmit sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under applicable laws and regulatory penalties such a breach or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by such a breach or disruption any of these results could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

a significant failure in our telecommunications or it infrastructure or systems could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenue and otherwise disrupt our business 

part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications financial control accounting customer service and other data processing systems between our clients’ offices our delivery centers and our client management locations moreover many of our key systems for corporate operations are internallydeveloped applications our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these internet it or communication systems which could be caused by among other things software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrading damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online or increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control internallydeveloped systems may not possess the same level of control security or support that traditional thirdparty systems and applications do loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenue or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by the disclosure of confidential information system failures or errors 

 if any person including any of our personnel misappropriates sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws some of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for certain occurrences including breaches of confidentiality and infringement indemnity furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief any such breach or misappropriation resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

if we cause disruptions to our clients’ businesses or provide inadequate service our clients may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose clients have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

if our it professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our clients or fail to consistently meet service requirements of a client these errors or failures could disrupt the client’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us furthermore any errors by our employees in the performance of services for a client or poor execution of such services could result in a client terminating our engagement and seeking damages from us in addition a failure or inability to meet a contractual requirement could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business any failure in a client’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us whether or not successful could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we may invest substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

as our business grows we may invest in new facilities and physical infrastructure we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies do not perform to our expectations our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

part of our expansion strategy includes strategic acquisitions these transactions involve significant challenges including that the risk that an acquisition does not advance our business strategy that we do not achieve a satisfactory return on our investment that we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company’s employees client relationships and operations and that the transactions divert significant management attention and financial resources from our ongoing business 

the primary value of many potential acquisition targets in the it services industry lies in their skilled it professionals and established client relationships transitioning these types of assets to our business can be particularly difficult due to different corporate cultures and values geographic distance and other intangible factors these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and make it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties 

the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions 

if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including as a result of a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business 

our earnings could be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in the cis and cee or such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we do not accrue incremental us taxes on all cis and cee earnings as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2015 these increased taxes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus and other countries to companies in our industry 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from belarusian income tax which as of the date of this annual report was 18 and from the value added tax for a period of 15 consecutive years effective july 1 2006 and levied at a reduced rate on a variety of taxes our subsidiary in russia benefits from a substantially reduced rate on social contributions and an exemption on value added tax in certain circumstances which is a benefit to qualified it companies in russia if these tax benefits are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — provision for income taxes” 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our it professionals or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

some of our it professionals are retained as independent contractors although we believe that we have properly classified these individuals as independent contractors there is nevertheless a risk that the irs or another federal state provincial or foreign authority will take a different view furthermore the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as can the interpretation of the applicable laws if a government authority or court enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change these classification tests or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there is also a risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws in this area further if it were determined that any of our independent contractors should be treated as employees we could possibly incur additional liabilities under our applicable employee benefit plans 

in addition we have classified nearly all of our us employees as “exempt” under the federal labor standards act or the flsa if it were determined that any of our us employees should be classified as “nonexempt” under the flsa we may incur costs and liabilities for back wages unpaid overtime fines or penalties andor be subject to employee litigation 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses 

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources 

most of the agreements we have entered into with our clients require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in some countries in which we operate although to date no client has brought any claims against us for such failure our clients have the right to terminate these agreements as a result of such failure 

the banking and financial systems in less developed markets where we hold funds remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore in russia belarus and other cis countries bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in that region which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability as a result we might face significant legal liability and payment obligations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in some countries in which we operate may not be as effective as that in the united states or other countries with more mature legal systems 

we require our employees and independent contractors to enter into written agreements with us upon the commencement of their relationship with us which assign to epam all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or engagement with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients and vendors thes e a greements may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technology reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our clients’ technologies tools and applications without paying us for doing so and our clients may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks 

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

in addition we rely on certain thirdparty software to conduct our business if we lose the licenses which permit us to use such software they may be difficult to replace and it may be costly to do so 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties 

we typically indemnify clients who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our clients redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our clients may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms in addition we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies 

further our current and former employees andor subcontractors could challenge our exclusive rights in the software they have developed in the course of their employment in russia and certain other countries in which we operate an employer is deemed to own the copyright in works created by its employees during the course and within the scope of their employment but the employer may be required to satisfy additional legal requirements in order to make further use and dispose of such works while we believe that we have complied with all such requirements and have fulfilled all requirements necessary to acquire all rights in software developed by our independent contractors andor subcontractors these requirements are often ambiguously defined and enforced as a result we cannot assure that we would be successful in defending against any claim by our current or former employees independent contractors andor subcontractors challenging our exclusive rights over the use and transfer of works those employees independent contractors andor subcontractors created or requesting additional compensation for such works 

parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business a successful infringement claim against us whether with or without merit could among others things require us to pay substantial damages develop noninfringing technology or rebrand our name or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and would require us to cease making licensing or using products that have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential clients deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our clients against infringement claims in certain instances any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anticorruption laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

as a company with international operations we are subject to many laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and other laws concerning our international operations the fcpa’s foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions although varying in both scope and jurisdiction and not limited to transactions with government officials we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 

we have a compliance program with controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and similar sanctions laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of such program may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws 

antioutsourcing legislation and restrictions on immigration if adopted may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the majority of our employees are nationals of cis and cee countries and in 2015 we added significant headcount in india some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our clients’ facilities which are sometimes located outside the cis cee and india the ability of our employees to work in necessary locations around the world depends on their ability to obtain the required visas and work permits and this process can be lengthy and difficult immigration laws are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions 

in addition the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues many organizations and public figures in the united states and europe have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing it services providers and the loss of jobs in their home countries and there are legislative measures under consideration in the us congress and in various state legislatures to address this concern it is possible that pending legislation in the united states may impose restrictions on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to client locations which could adversely impact our business it is generally difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or maintaining business visas for our employees however if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain work visas 

our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our clients on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

similarly legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in european jurisdictions or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of services from an offshore location could also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to an it services provider or changes its current it services provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous it services provider are entitled to become employees of the new it services provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous it services provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other european union countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation could materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and european union and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and european union in a costeffective manner 

our cis subsidiaries can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements 

we operate in cis countries primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of other cis countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if the company fails to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation of any damages if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including 

 our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expense and affect our operations 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act sec regulations and new york stock exchange or nyse rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours these new or changed laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and corporate governance practices as a result our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice our reputation may be harmed

summary of results of operations and nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



for 2015  we reported results of operations consistent with the continued execution of our strategy during 2015  our operating expenses increased in line with our increase in revenues as we continue to invest in our people processes and infrastructure to support our goal to deliver highquality offerings that meet the needs of our customers differentiate our value proposition from that of our competition and drive scale and growth 

the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2015  were as follows 

 the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

we have significant international operations and we earn revenues and incur expenses in multiple currencies when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared in “constant currency terms” a nongaap financial measure that excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the effect of rate fluctuations is excluded by translating the current period’s revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report for a discussion of our exposure to exchange rates 

effects of inflation 

economies in cis countries particularly belarus russia kazakhstan and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries and as a result decrease demand for our services and negatively impact the business of our existing clients inflation is likely to increase some of our expenses which may reduce our profitability as we may not be able to pass these increases on to our clients generally our largest expense that could be impacted by inflation is wages we do not rely on borrowed funds for operations in those locations therefore increases in interest rates typical for inflationary environments do not currently pose a risk to our business 

ukraine has been experiencing political and economic turmoil with no improvement as of the date of this report severely impacting the ukrainian economy the ukrainian currency has been weakened and the negative outlook in the ukrainian economy continues we have not seen a significant impact from the inflation in ukraine additionally we do not have clients located in ukraine 

inflation in russia increased late in 2014 due to weakening of the russian ruble and decreasing oil prices during 2015 inflation in russia remained steady with some decline observed in recent months our operations in russia have not been affected directly by local inflation however we have noted some decline in demand for our services by our clients in russia 

belarus has been experiencing hyperinflation over the last several years the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments including increasing interest rates and the use of antimonopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize the local currency inflation government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed to economic uncertainty in belarus belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future we have not seen a significant impact from the inflation in belarus as our largest expense there wages is denominated in us dollars in order to provide stability in our business and for our employees additionally we do not have significant clients located in belarus and for the year ended december 31 2015  we had approximately 15  or 02  of our revenues denominated in belarusian rubles the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in belarus is us dollars 

other locations where we have clients or perform services are not experiencing significant inflation and our business is not materially impacted by inflation in those locations 

periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and as a result may reduce our profitability inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counterinflationary measures that may harm our financial condition results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities

we manage the utilization levels of our professionals through hiring and training highperforming it professionals and efficient staffing of projects our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services some of our it professionals are specifically hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or projects

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2015  2014  and 2013  we had 1138 million  942 million 698 million respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory us tax rate additionally we have secured special tax benefits in belarus as described below as a result our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes because of the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18 the “on hightechnologies park” decree which created the belarus hitech park is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1 2006

results by business segment 

our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available that is used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some specific cases however managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team in a case like this the client’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment our codm evaluates the company’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit 

segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to similar factors pressures and challenges expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses we use globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources as a result a majority of our expenses is shared by all segments these shared expenses include delivery recruitment and development sales and marketing and support functions such as it finance legal and human resources generally shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense eg recorded hours or headcount however certain expenses are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against our total income from operations 

revenues from external clients and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe russia and other reportable segments for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows

during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  revenues from our north america segment were 515  and 513  of total revenues representing an increase of 971 million  or 259  over the corresponding period in 2014  the north america segment’s operating profits increased by 217 million  or 239  as compared to the same period of 2014  to 1123 million  net operating profit north america remains our most profitable segment with operating profit composing 238  of revenues 

the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31 2015  was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing top customer relationships as well as our recent acquisitions operating results of the north america operating segment benefited from our 2014 acquisitions in the life sciences and healthcare industry as well as acquisitions of navigationarts and ags during 2015 

europe segment 

during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  revenues from our europe segment were 438  and 410  of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 1012 million  or 338  in 2015  over the 2014  results during 2015  the europe segment’s operating profits increased by 185 million  or 369  as compared to the corresponding period of 2014  to 687 million  net profit from the segment’s operations 

europe continues to be a growing segment in our portfolio as our business model continues to gain considerable traction with europeanbased clients primarily in the financial services and travel and consumer verticals furthermore our europe segment benefited from the continued growth of jointech a company we acquired in 2014 with locations in southeast asia this extended reach into a new geography created additional options for our existing customers within the financial services vertical particularly in the areas of investment banking and wealth and asset management we expect that our new and existing customers will use our services in that fastgrowing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment 

russia and other segments 

during the years ended december 31 2015  revenues from the russia and the other operating segments decreased by 127 million  and 06 million  respectively over corresponding period of 2014  operating profits of the russia segment decreased 18 million  and the operating losses of the other segment decreased 31 million  when compared with the operating profits losses of these segments in the corresponding period of 2014  

revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments causing instability between revenues and associated profits additionally strong foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 further destabilized the economic situation in the regions that are included in these segments and negatively impacted our business in russia and cis countries during 2015 since 2014 the united states and the european union have imposed sanctions targeting russian government and governmentcontrolled interests and certain government officials while this has not directly impacted our business in russia the sanctions aggravated the overall russian economy and negatively influenced the business of our major clients in the region decreasing demand for our services 

2014 compared to 2013 

north america segment 

during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 revenues from our north america segment were 513 and 513 of total revenues representing an increase of 899 million or 316 over the corresponding period in 2013 the north america segment’s operating profits increased by 238 million or 356 as compared to the same period of 2013 to 906 million net operating profit 

the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as our recent acquisitions the largest growth was in the other vertical due to acquiring new clients in the healthcare insurance and life sciences industries through a 2014 acquisition as well as creating synergies with existing customers in those markets during the year ended december 31 2014 combined revenue growth from customers in the other vertical accounted for 348 million representing a 974 growth over prior year 

all other verticals in the north america segment experienced revenue growth and increases in operating profit in 2014 as compared to 2013 mainly due to increased business from our longterm clients with some contribution from the clients acquired in connection with acquisitions the largest vertical the isvs and technology grew revenues by 221 million or 186 in 2014 as compared to the corresponding period of 2013 revenues from our travel and consumer vertical in 2014 increased by 146 million or 267 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013 banking and financial services had an increase in revenue of 59 million or 454 and operating profit increased by 1049 in this vertical in 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 2013 business information and media grew in revenue 125 million or 20 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 

europe segment 

during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 revenues from our europe segment were 410 and 368 of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 951 million or 466 in 2014 over the 2013 results during 2014 the europe segment’s operating profits increased by 156 million or 452 as compared to the corresponding period of 2013 to 502 million net profit from the segment’s operations 

europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio given our nearshore delivery capabilities and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services our business model continues to gain considerable traction with europeanbased clients primarily in the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals furthermore our europe segment benefited from the acquisition of jointech a company with locations in southeast asia which created a new value proposition for our existing customers within the banking and financial services vertical particularly in the areas of investment banking wealth and asset management and extended our reach into new geography we expect that many of our new and existing customers in other business verticals will use our services in that fastgrowing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment 

russia and other segments 

during the years ended december 31 2014 revenues from the russia and other operating segments decreased by 51 million and 49 million respectively over corresponding period of 2013 operating profits of the russia segment showed no changes when compared with the operating profits of this segment in 2013 while profits of other segments decreased 41 million compared to 2013 

revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments as a result we recorded the cost related to the performance of services in 2014 with no associated revenues recognized in the period that services were rendered these business arrangements were further exacerbated by strong foreign currency fluctuations in the fourth quarter of 2014 negatively impacting our business in russia and cis countries 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

at december 31 2015  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 1994 million  a oneyear time deposit maturing in march 2016 in the amount of 300 million and 650 million  of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of that date 1819 million  of our total cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states of this amount 793 million  was held in us dollar denominated accounts in belarus including deposits that accrued interest at an average interest rate of 48  during 2015  

in 2014 we repatriated 758 million us dollars from belarus into our cyprus entity’s bank in the united kingdom in march 2015 300 million of this amount has been placed into a oneyear interest bearing time deposit within the same bank as of december 31 2015  the remaining unrestricted balance of 287 million  us dollars is kept in a savings account in our cyprus entity’s bank in the united kingdom 

 our subsidiaries in the cis or apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than us dollars 

the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds however as a result of various factors such as any global or regional instability or changes in tax laws in place for a specific time period we may later decide to repatriate some or all of our funds to the united states if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends 2121 million  would be subject to foreign withholding taxes of which 1840 million  would also be subject to us corporate income tax we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flows increase our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside of the us and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions 

on september 12 2014 we established a revolving credit facility with pnc bank national association santander bank na and silicon valley bank this credit facility consists of a 1000 million  revolving line of credit with a maturity date of september 12 2019  there is potential to increase the credit facility up to 2000 million  if certain conditions are met borrowings under the 2014 credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or up to a maximum of 500 million  in british pounds sterling canadian dollars euros or swiss francs or other currencies as may be approved by the lenders at december 31 2015  we had outstanding debt of 350  million with the balance of the credit limit of 650 million  remaining available for use 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31 2015  decreased 285 million  to 764 million  as compared to 1049 million  net cash provided by operations in 2014  during 2015  operating cash flows were impacted by increases in billed and unbilled accounts receivable and greater accrued expenses which were mostly impacted by increases in bonus compensation during 2015  we have recorded more accounts receivable and unbilled revenue as compared to the same period in 2014  the increases in billed and unbilled receivables are consistent with our growth in revenue and the majority of unbilled receivables are current with nearly 60 recorded in december 2015 and over 90 recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 

net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31 2014 increased 466 million to 1049 million as compared to 582 million net cash provided by operations in 2013 during 2014 operating cash flows benefited in part from our strong focus on improving working capital efficiencies during the latter part of 2013 including focus on reducing days outstanding for our billed and unbilled receivables this emphasis more than offset the higher working capital requirements associated with increased revenues including growth in total compensation and benefits of our it professionals overhead expenses and higher tax payments 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2015  was 1255 million  and consisted primarily of a 300 million interest bearing time deposit set up by our cyprus entity in the united kingdom in march 2015 and 769 million  net cash used in the business combinations with navigationarts and ags the cash spent on acquisitions of businesses in 2015 increased 398 million  compared to 2014  

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2014 increased 311 million to 529 million as compared to 218 million used in investing activities during the corresponding period of 2013 the increase was primarily attributable to 371 million spent on acquisitions of businesses partially offset by a net 62 million decrease in loans issued under the employee housing program compared to the corresponding period last year 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2015  was 338 million  a decrease of 234 million  from the same period in 2014  primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of 30 million  as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stockbased compensation plans partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises 

net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2014 was 103 million a decrease of 52 million from the same period in 2013 primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of 4 million as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stockbased compensation plans partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  



during the year ended december 31 2015  the company completed construction of the office building within the high technologies park in minsk belarus and therefore no future capital requirements exist related to this construction see note 15   i n the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for further information 

future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future our ability to generate cash however is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 15  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report 

revenue recognition — we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved at the time revenues are recognized we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms 

we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings which represent specific competencies of our it professionals contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition pattern fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements 

the majority of our revenues  858  of revenues in 2015  847  in 2014  and 823  in 2013  are generated under timeandmaterial contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client 

revenues from fixedprice contracts  128  of revenues in 2015  136  in 2014  and 157  in 2013  are determined using the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the client revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client in order to estimate the amount of revenue for the period under the proportional performance method we determine the percentage of actual labor hours incurred as compared to estimated total labor hours and apply that percentage to the consideration allocated to the deliverable the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements a number of internal and external factors can affect such estimates including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known no significant revisions occurred in each of the three years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of 12 months or less 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as these expenses are billable to our clients 

business combinations — we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the fasb asc topic 805 “business combinations” we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain 

if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported for which the accounting is incomplete with retrospective adjustment made to such provisional amounts during the measurement period to present new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends and in no case beyond one  year from the acquisition date revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings 

all acquisitionrelated costs other than the costs to issue debt or equity securities are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred changes in fair value of contingent consideration arrangements that are not measurement period adjustments are recognized in earnings payments to settle contingent consideration if any are reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the changes in fair value are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the acquired assets typically consist of customer relationships trade names noncompetition agreements and workforce and as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets — goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are treated consistently with fasb asc 350 “intangibles  goodwill and other” we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 

we assess goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently in certain circumstances events or circumstances that might require impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations we initially perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment indicators after applying the qualitative assessment if we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required 

if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform a quantitative impairment test if an indicator of impairment is identified the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to its carrying amount and the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying value over the fair value the fair values are estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings multiples based on market data these valuations are considered level 3 measurements under fasb asc topic 820 we utilize estimates to determine the fair value of the reporting units such as future cash flows growth rates capital requirements effective tax rates and projected margins among other factors estimates utilized in the future evaluations of goodwill for impairment could differ from estimates used in the current period calculations we are also required to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for impairment between annual assessment dates as events or circumstances dictate based on our assessment these operating segments are not at risk for impairment 

intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of the asset’s carrying value using estimates of future cash flows that utilize a discount rate determined by the management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model over the remaining asset life the estimates of future cash flows attributable to intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value all of our intangible assets have finite lives 

 effective in the fourth quarter of 2013 we changed the annual goodwill impairment assessment date for all of our reporting units from december 31 st  to october 31 st  which represented a voluntary change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date 

income taxes —   the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 

stockbased compensation  — equitybased compensation cost relating to the issuance of sharebased awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant which is expensed ratably over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures over time the forfeiture assumption is adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate and such change may affect the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period equitybased awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately equitybased awards that do not meet the criteria for equity classification are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and concentration of credit risks in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of employee loans receivable cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues 

at december 31 2015  outstanding loans issued to employees were 63 million  or 08  of our total assets these loans potentially expose us to a risk of nonpayment and loss repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of borrowers obtained through their employment with epam and may be adversely affected by macroeconomic changes such as currency devaluation and inflation given a large demand for the program among our employees and its advantages as compared to alternative methods of financing available on the market we expect the borrowers to fulfill their obligations and we estimate the probability of voluntary termination of employment among the borrowers as de minimis additionally housing loans are capped at 50 thousand per loan and secured by real estate financed through the program we establish a maximum loantovalue ratio of 70 and expect a decrease in the ratio over the life of a housing loan due to ongoing payments by employees 

we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties we hold a significant balance of cash in banks in the cis countries where banking and other financial systems generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities in the cis region are not insured as of december 31 2015  1037 million  of total cash was held in cis countries with 795 million  of that in belarus and 105 million  in russia the cis banking sector remains subject to periodic instability and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards particularly in belarus a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis region which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition cash in other cis locations is used for shortterm operational needs and cash balances in those banks move with the needs of the entities 

trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across our clients in proportion to their revenues as of december 31 2015  billed and unbilled trade receivables from one  customer ubs ag individually exceeded 10 and accounted for 124  and 198  of our total billed and unbilled trade receivables respectively 

during the year ended   december 31 2015  our top five customers accounted for 326  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 438  of our total revenues respectively during the year ended   december 31 2014  our top five customers accounted for 328  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 439  of our total revenues respectively 

during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  the company had one  customer ubs ag  with associated revenues of 1298 million  and 976 million  respectively which accounted for more than 10 of total revenues in the periods indicated 

historically credit losses and writeoffs of trade accounts receivable balances have not been material to our consolidated financial statements   

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is mainly influenced by the changes in interest rates received on our cash and cash equivalent deposits and paid on any outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the type and timing of funds borrowed 

as of december 31 2015  we have borrowed under the line of credit and have outstanding debt of 350 million  the interest rate for this debt is based on libor which is set to change quarterly according to the 2014 credit facility agreement we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates related to this borrowing 

we offer loans under the employee housing program and these loans are designed to be a retention mechanism for our employees in belarus these loans are financed with available funds of our belarusian subsidiary and we do not believe that employee loans issued by us under the employee housing program expose us to significant interest rate risks 

we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates and we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility however our future interest expense may increase and interest income may fall due to changes in market interest rates 

foreign exchange risk 

our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars however our business is conducted in various currencies outside of the united states we operate primarily through whollyowned subsidiaries in canada europe asia and the cis and cee regions and generate a significant portion of our revenues in currencies other than the us dollar principally euros british pounds sterling canadian dollars swiss francs and russian rubles we incur expenditures in nonus dollar currencies principally in hungarian forints euros russian rubles polish zlotys mexican pesos hong kong dollars and china yuan renminbi “cny” associated with our delivery centers located in the cee europe mexico and apac regions 

our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in these foreign currencies and cash outflows for expenditures in foreign currencies our results of operations can be affected if any of the currencies which we use materially in our business appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues and expenses our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is naturally diversified due to the variety of countries and currencies in which we conduct business 

based on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2015  if currencies were not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations and results were evaluated on the constant currency basis using rates from the year 2014  our consolidated revenue would have been higher by 57 revenue has been negatively impacted by all currencies when compared on the constant currency basis to the year 2014  with main differences coming from the decline in the russian ruble euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar if compared on the same constant currency basis our net income would have been lower by 15 as the impact from the currency declines also had some favorable impact on the expenses at our offshore delivery centers net income for the year 2015  compared on the constant currency basis to the year 2014  was impacted positively by the russian ruble hungarian forint and polish zloty and was offset mostly by the negative impact from the euro british pounds sterling and canadian dollar overall the most significant impact on the 2015  results was from the euro the russian ruble and canadian dollar fluctuations 

to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion changes in the currency exchange rates resulted in our reporting a net transactional foreign currency exchange losses of 46 million  and 22 million  during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in net foreign exchange loss for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to 2014  was primarily attributable to changes in exchange rates of russian ruble euro british pound sterling and canadian dollar against us dollar in the periods indicated including realized losses from foreign currency conversions these losses are included in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

additionally foreign currency translation adjustments from translating financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from functional currency to the us dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity or included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income if local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries differ from their functional currencies as of december 31 2015  approximately 236  of our total net assets were subject to foreign currency translation exposure as compared to 219  as of december 31 2014  during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  net income generated by foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency was not us dollars was 370  and 351  respectively during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  we recorded 131 million  and 203 million  of translation losses respectively within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

our success depends largely on the contributions of our it professionals to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business we must attract train and retain skilled it professionals including experienced management it professionals competition for it professionals in the markets in which we operate can be intense and accordingly we may not be able to retain or hire all of the it professionals necessary to meet our ongoing and future business needs if we are unable to attract and retain the highlyskilled it professionals we need we may have to forgo projects for lack of resources or be unable to staff projects optimally the total attrition rates among our it professionals who have worked for us for at least six months were 118  131  and 107  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we may encounter higher attrition rates in the future any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire it professionals to meet our business requirements a significant increase in the attrition rate among it professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services 

increases in wages for our it professionals and other compensation expense could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and result in dilution to our stockholders 

wage costs for it professionals in cis cee and apac and certain other geographies in which we operate are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the service industry in these countries may 

increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our it professionals as well as the prices we can charge for our services increases in wage costs may reduce our profitability 

additionally we have granted certain equitybased awards under our stock incentive plans and entered into certain other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past as a result of which we have recorded 246  million 132  million and 68  million as stockbased compensation expenses for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” prescribe how we account for stockbased compensation which could adversely or negatively impact our results of operations or the price of our common stock gaap requires us to recognize stockbased compensation as compensation expense in the statement of operations generally based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of the grant with compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the number of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations the issuance of equitybased compensation would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted 

if any of our senior executives or key personnel such as business development managers joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients suppliers knowhow and key it professionals and staff members to them additionally there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge practices or procedures by such personnel if any dispute arises between our senior executives or key personnel and us any noncompetition nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key personnel might not provide effective protection to us especially in cis and cee countries where some of our senior executives and key employees reside in light of uncertainties with legal systems in cis and cee countries 

  our subcontracting practices may expose us to technical uncertainties potential liabilities and reputational harm 

in order to meet our personnel needs increase workforce flexibility and improve pricing competitiveness we use subcontractors and freelancers primarily to perform shortterm assignments in certain specialty areas or on other projects where it is impractical to use our employees where we need to supplement our resources or for other purposes as needed although we try to source competent and credible third parties as our subcontractors they may not be able to deliver the level of service that our clients expect us to deliver furthermore we enter into confidentiality agreements with our subcontractors but we cannot guarantee that they will not breach the confidentiality of our clients or us and misappropriate our or our clients’ proprietary information and technology in the course of providing service we as the party to the contract with the client are directly responsible for the losses our subcontractors cause our clients under the subcontracting agreements we enter into our subcontractors generally promise to indemnify us for damages caused by their breach but we may be unable to collect under these agreements moreover their breaches may damage our reputation cause us to lose existing business and adversely affect our ability to acquire new business in the future 

  adverse or uncertain economic political and social conditions may significantly and adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition 

we are a global company with substantial international operations our revenues from clients outside north america represented 485  478  and 508  of our revenues excluding reimbursable expenses for 2014  2013  and 2012  deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and our failure to successfully anticipate changing conditions in these markets could challenge our ability to conduct operations in those countries or regions or increase our operating costs in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in the cis and cee 

risks inherent in conducting international operations include 

 the it services industry is particularly sensitive to the economic environment and the industry tends to decline during general economic downturns given our significant revenues from north america and europe if those economies further weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our clients may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

war terrorism other acts of violence or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate our clients and our service delivery 

our business may be negatively affected by instability disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which we operate regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest and natural or manmade disasters including famine flood fire earthquake storm or disease such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for it services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified it professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled it professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

emerging markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks 

we have significant operations in cis and cee countries and beginning in 2014 in asia which are generally considered to be emerging markets investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including complying with foreign laws and regulations and the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions tax increases fluctuations in exchange rates inflation and unstable political and military situations and labor issues for example the economies of belarus russia ukraine hungary and other cis and cee countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns moreover these markets have less established legal systems which can be characterized by gaps in regulatory structures selective enforcement of laws and limited judicial and administrative guidance on legislation among other limitations as has happened in the past financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies could dampen foreign investment in these markets and materially adversely affect their economies such economic instability and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations may be adversely affected by ongoing developments in the ukraine 

escalating military activities in ukraine and on its eastern border have combined with ukraine’s weak economic conditions to create uncertainty in ukraine russia and other markets the actions in ukraine have prompted condemnation from the international community and combined with the continuing political and economic uncertainties in ukraine have had an adverse effect on the ukrainian and russian economies in april 2014 the united states office of foreign assets control “ofac” added certain individuals and entities to its list of specially designated nationals in july and september 2014 ofac imposed limited specific sanctions on certain russian entities by listing them on the sectoral sanctions identification 

list “ssi list” the ssi list includes entities in the energy defense and financial sectors the eu imposed similar sanctions in july 2014 and separate sanctions were imposed by countries including canada japan and switzerland resolution of ukraine’s political and economic conditions may not occur for some time and the disputes in ukraine could devolve into increased violence or economic distress 

we have delivery centers in the ukraine employing approximately 2956  it professionals none of which are located in crimea we also have delivery centers in russia employing approximately 1714  it professionals located in various cities including moscow and st petersburg to date we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity all epam offices remain open and fully functional including those we use in the ukraine and russia to support our clients we continue to monitor the situation closely our contingency plans include relocating work or personnel to other locations and adding new locations as appropriate we have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation as the political and civil unrest and reported military activities are fluid and beyond our control prolonged unrest military activities or broadbased sanctions should they be implemented could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we generate a significant portion of our revenues from a concentrated client base and any loss of business from these clients could materially reduce our revenues 

our ability to maintain close relationships with our major clients is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for any specific client is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our clients’ exclusive it services provider and we do not have longterm commitments from any clients to purchase our services the it services we provide to our clients and the revenues and net income from those services may decline or vary based on the type and quantity of services we provide wage inflation and other pricing considerations furthermore our reliance on any individual client for a significant portion of our revenues may give that client a certain degree of pricing leverage against us when negotiating contracts and terms of service the loss of any of our major clients or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations 

we do not have longterm commitments from our clients and our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts 

ability of our clients to terminate agreements makes our future revenues uncertain as our clients are generally not obligated for any longterm commitments to us although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from clients who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature in addition our clients can terminate many of our master services agreements and work orders with or without cause therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements end our failure to perform or observe any contractual obligations could also result in termination or nonrenewal of a contract as could a change of control of our company 

there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including a clients 

 termination or nonrenewal of a customer contract could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and an increase in our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us which could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our clients is concentrated in four specific industry verticals banking and financial services isvs and technology business information and media and travel and consumer our business growth largely depends on 

continued demand for our services from clients in these four industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource it services 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example a worsening of economic conditions in the financial services industry or significant consolidation in any of these industries may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes decreased demand for our services or increased pricing pressure on us from our clients in these key industries could adversely affect our results of operations 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work or if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects the marketplace and global economic conditions including foreign exchange volatility which may be based on limited data and could be inaccurate many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform sometimes include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable moreover if we are not able to pass on to our clients increases in compensation cost whether driven by competition for talent or ordinarycourse pay increases or charge premium prices when justified by market demand or the type of service our profitability may suffer 

in addition a number of our contracts contain pricing terms that condition a portion of the payment of fees by the client on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules set forth in the contracts our failure to meet such performance goals service levels or completion schedules or our failure to meet client expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements 

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization levels and productivity levels 

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization levels of fixedcost resources including human resources as well as other resources such as computers and office space and our ability to increase our productivity levels we have expanded our operations significantly in recent years which has resulted in a significant increase in our headcount and fixed overhead costs some of our it professionals are specially trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any client or on any project for which we have dedicated it professionals or facilities we may not be able to efficiently reallocate these it professionals and facilities to other clients and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer 

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

to successfully perform larger and more complex projects we need to establish and maintain effective close relationships with our clients continue high levels of client satisfaction and develop a thorough understanding of our clients’ operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including 

 16 

 our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our management personnel and it professionals some of whom do not have experience managing largescale or complex projects in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements a failure by us to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business impact our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our it services which requires significant investment of human resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients’ decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other it services providers or inhouse resources and the timing of our clients’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and hinder our revenue growth for certain clients we may begin work and incur costs prior to executing a contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our clients may experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology thereby further delaying the implementation process our current and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to whom we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could materially adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients weak macroeconomic conditions and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected moreover in the event of delays in payment from our governmental and quasigovernmental clients we may have difficulty collecting on receivables owed in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we face intense competition for clients and opportunities from onshore and offshore it services companies and increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

the market for it services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are reputation and track record industry expertise breadth and depth of service offerings quality of the services offered language marketing and selling skills scalability of infrastructure ability to address clients’ timing requirements and price 

we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations clients tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider 

which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other competing it services providers clients may prefer it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some cis and cee countries 

current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore it services providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore it services provider this shift away from offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the countries in which our clients operate 

some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources than epam client buying patterns can change if clients become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers with less emphasis on quality therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our clients while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

our ability to generate and retain business depends on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our service and our clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services is critical to the profitability of our engagements we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees 

however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose clients and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards are inherent in the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in it services enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing client needs the process of developing our client solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep pace with changes in technology methodology and business is subject to a number of risks including that 

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our clients could cause us to lose clients and materially adversely affect our business 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our services or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current clients and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of client data a failure to attract new clients or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our clients and us errors will not be found in new software product development solutions which could result in litigation other claims for damages against us as well as reputational harm and thus could materially adversely affect our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to network security could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

in the ordinary course of business we have access to collect store process and transmit sensitive or confidential data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to human error malfeasance or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed misappropriated lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties such a breach or disruption could also disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services as well as require us to expend significant resources to protect against further breaches and to rectify problems caused by such a breach or disruption any of these results could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position 

a significant failure in our telecommunications or it infrastructure or systems could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenue and otherwise disrupt our business 

part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications financial control accounting customer service and other data processing systems between our clients’ offices our delivery centers and our client management locations including our headquarters in newtown pa moreover many of our key systems for corporate operations are internallydeveloped applications our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these internet it or communication systems which could be caused by among other things software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrading damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online or increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control internallydeveloped systems may not possess the same level of control security or support that traditional thirdparty systems and applications do loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenue or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by the disclosure of confidential information system failures or errors 

 if any person including any of our employees misappropriates sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws some of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for certain occurrences including breaches of confidentiality and infringement indemnity furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief any such breach or misappropriation resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

if we cause disruptions to our clients’ businesses or provide inadequate service our clients may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose clients have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

if our it professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our clients or fail to consistently meet service requirements of a client these errors or failures could disrupt the client’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us in addition a failure or inability to meet a contractual requirement could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business any failure in a client’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial 

damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure furthermore any errors by our employees in the performance of services for a client or poor execution of such services could result in a client terminating our engagement and seeking damages from us the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations even if such assertions against us are unsuccessful we may incur reputational harm and substantial legal fees 

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our delivery centers such as in minsk belarus we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies are difficult to integrate divert management resources or do not perform to our expectations we may not be able to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisitions and our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

we have from time to time expanded our service capabilities and gained new clients through strategic acquisitions our ability to successfully integrate acquired assets or an acquired entity and realize the benefits of an acquisition requires among other things successful integration of technologies operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner challenges we face in the acquisition and integration process include 

 the primary value of many potential acquisition targets in the it services industry lies in their skilled it professionals and established client relationships transitioning these types of assets to our business can be particularly difficult due to different corporate cultures and values geographic distance and other intangible factors for example some newly acquired employees may decide not to work with us or to leave shortly after their move to our company and some acquired clients may decide to discontinue their commercial relationships with us these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and make it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of 

such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties 

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business including operations marketing sales and delivery functions us transfer pricing regulations as well as regulations applicable in other countries in which we operate require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be on arm’slength terms we consider the transactions among our subsidiaries to be on arm’slength terms the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions 

if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including as a result of a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business 

our earnings could be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in the cis and cee or such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we do not accrue incremental us taxes on all cis and cee earnings as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2014 these increased taxes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus hungary and russia to companies in our industry 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from belarusian income tax which as of the date of this annual report was 18 and from the value added tax for a period of 15 consecutive years effective july 1 2006 and levied at a reduced rate on a variety of taxes in addition our subsidiary in hungary benefited from a tax credit of 10 of qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 to 2012 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 however will be allowed through 2014 we have fully utilized the 70 limit in 2014 our subsidiary in russia benefits from a substantially reduced rate on social contributions and an exemption on value added tax in certain circumstances which is a benefit to qualified it companies in russia if the tax holiday relating to our belarusian subsidiary the tax incentives relating to our hungarian subsidiary or the lower tax rates and social contributions relating to our russian subsidiary are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for income taxes” 

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 

us gaap under which we prepare our consolidated financial statements is subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission “sec” and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow gaap under sec regulations and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our it professionals or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

some of our it professionals are retained as independent contractors although we believe that we have properly classified these individuals as independent contractors there is nevertheless a risk that the irs or another federal state provincial or foreign authority will take a different view furthermore the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities if a federal state provincial or foreign authority or court enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs under such laws and regulations including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there is also a risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged noncompliance with federal state provincial or foreign tax laws further if it were determined that any of our independent contractors should be treated as employees we could possibly incur additional liabilities under our applicable employee benefit plans 

in addition we have classified nearly all of our us employees as “exempt” under the federal labor standards act or the flsa if it were determined that any of our us employees should be classified as “nonexempt” under the flsa we may incur costs and liabilities for back wages unpaid overtime fines or penalties andor be subject to employee litigation 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses 

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources 

most of the agreements we have entered into with our clients require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in cis and cee countries although to date no client has brought any claims against us for such failure our clients have the right to terminate these agreements as a result of such failure 

the banking and financial systems in the cis remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore in russia belarus and other cis countries bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant international operations and we earn our revenues and incur our expenses in multiple currencies doing business in different foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks including risks related to revenues and receivables compensation of our personnel purchases and capital expenditures the majority of our revenues are in us dollars british pounds russian rubles and euros and the majority of our expenses particularly salaries of it professionals are denominated in us dollars but payable in belarusian rubles or in other local currencies at the exchange rate in effect at the time to the extent that we increase our business and revenues which are denominated in belarusian rubles ukrainian hryvnia hungarian forints or other local currencies we will also increase our receivables denominated in those currencies and therefore increase our exposure to fluctuations in their exchange rates against the us dollar our reporting currency also economic instability in russia and other countries can affect the local currency’s exchange rates such as the recent plunge in the value of the russian ruble any capital expenditures such as for computer equipment which are payable in the local currency of the countries in which we operate but are imported to such countries and any deposits we hold in local currencies can be materially affected by depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar and the effect of such depreciation on the local 

economy due to the increasing size of our international operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability as a result we might face significant legal liability and payment obligations and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as intellectual property assignment and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in cis and cee countries and other countries in which we operate may not be as effective as that in the united states or other countries with more mature legal systems 

we require our employees and independent contractors to enter into written agreements with us upon the commencement of their relationship with us which assign to epam all intellectual property and work product made developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or engagement with us these agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential we also enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our clients and vendors thes e a greements may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technology reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our clients’ technologies tools and applications without paying us for doing so and our clients may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks 

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

in addition we rely on certain thirdparty software to conduct our business if we lose the licenses which permit us to use such software they may be difficult to replace and it may be costly to do so 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties 

we typically indemnify clients who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to 

pay damages on behalf of our clients redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our clients may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms in addition we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies 

further our current and former employees andor subcontractors could challenge our exclusive rights in the software they have developed in the course of their employment in russia and certain other countries in which we operate an employer is deemed to own the copyright in works created by its employees during the course and within the scope of their employment but the employer may be required to satisfy additional legal requirements in order to make further use and dispose of such works while we believe that we have complied with all such requirements and have fulfilled all requirements necessary to acquire all rights in software developed by our independent contractors andor subcontractors these requirements are often ambiguously defined and enforced as a result we cannot assure that we would be successful in defending against any claim by our current or former employees independent contractors andor subcontractors challenging our exclusive rights over the use and transfer of works those employees independent contractors andor subcontractors created or requesting additional compensation for such works 

parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business a successful infringement claim against us whether with or without merit could among others things require us to pay substantial damages develop noninfringing technology or rebrand our name or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and would require us to cease making licensing or using products that have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential clients deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our clients against infringement claims in certain instances any of these actions regardless of the outcome of litigation or merits of the claim could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate including export restrictions us economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar anticorruption laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

as a company with international operations we are subject to many laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and other laws concerning our international operations the fcpa’s foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions although varying in both scope and jurisdiction and not limited to transactions with government officials we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 

we have a compliance program with controls and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and similar sanctions laws and regulations the continuing implementation and ongoing development and monitoring of such program may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these or other laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or business restrictions and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws 

antioutsourcing legislation and restrictions on immigration if adopted may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the vast majority of our employees are nationals of cis and cee countries some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our clients’ facilities which are sometimes located outside the cis and cee the ability of our employees to work in the united states europe the cis and cee and other countries outside the cis and cee depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits historically the process for obtaining visas for nationals of cis and cee countries to certain countries including the united states and europe has been lengthy and cumbersome immigration laws in the united states and in other countries are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions 

in addition the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues many organizations and public figures in the united states and europe have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing it services providers and the loss of jobs in their home countries and there are legislative measures under consideration in the us congress and in various state legislatures to address this concern it is possible that pending legislation in the united states may impose restrictions on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to client locations which could adversely impact our ability to do business in the jurisdictions in which we have clients it is generally difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or maintaining business visas for our employees however if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain work visas 

our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our clients on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

similarly legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in european jurisdictions or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of services from an offshore location could also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to an it services provider or changes its current it services provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous it services provider are entitled to become employees of the new it services provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous it services provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other european union countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation could materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and european union and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and european union in a costeffective manner 

our cis subsidiaries can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements 

we operate in cis countries primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of other cis countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations if the company fails to comply with certain requirements including those relating to minimum net assets governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation of any damages if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including 

 our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expense and affect our operations 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act sec regulations and new york stock exchange or nyse rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours these new or changed laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and corporate governance practices as a result our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice our reputation may be harmed

summary of results of operations and nongaap financial measures 

the following table presents a summary of our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



for 2014  we reported results of operations consistent with the continued execution of our strategy in 2014  our operating expenses increased in line with increase in revenues we continue to invest in our people processes and infrastructure to support our goal to deliver highquality offerings that meet the needs of our customers differentiate our value proposition from that of our competition and drive scale and growth 

the key highlights of our consolidated results for 2014  and 2013  were as follows 

 the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls we discuss the following key measures that are not calculated according to usgaap 

 we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate trends in our core business and we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals manage our business and evaluate our performance we exclude certain expenses and benefits from nongaap income from operations that we believe are not reflective of these underlying business trends and are not useful measures in determining our operational performance and overall business strategy because our reported nongaap financial measures are not calculated according to gaap these measures are not comparable to gaap and may not be comparable to similarly described nongaap measures reported by other companies within our industry consequently our nongaap financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation from or supplant comparable gaap measures but rather should be considered together with our financial statements which are prepared according to gaap the following table presents a reconciliation of income from operations as reported on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



from time to time we acquire businesses and as such incur operating expenses which are not related to our core company or segment operations and may include acquisitionrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets these costs vary with the size and complexity of the related acquisition and are generally inconsistent in amount and frequency therefore the size complexity and volume of past acquisitions which often drive the magnitude of acquisitionrelated costs may not be indicative of the size complexity and volume of future transactions and costs 

amortization of purchased intangible assets is excluded from our nongaap measures to allow management to evaluate our operating results as if these assets have been developed internally rather than acquired in a business combination we believe this approach provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the acquired intangible assets are treated in a manner comparable to the internally developed assets 

stockbased compensation expense is excluded from our nongaap measures because we believe such exclusion allows for a more accurate comparison of our operating results among the periods as well as enhances comparability with operating results of peer companies 

we also exclude certain other expenses and onetime charges that we believe are not indicative of what we consider to be organic continuing operations such items include impairment writeoffs of goodwill and other assets legal settlement expenses and certain other noncash onetime charges and write offs 

see our “results of operations” section below for a more detailed discussion and analysis of these charges 

we have significant international operations and we earn revenues and incur expenses in multiple currencies when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared in “constant currency terms” a nongaap financial 

measure that excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the effect of rate fluctuations is excluded by translating the current period’s revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report for a discussion of our exposure to exchange rates 

effects of inflation 

economies in cis countries such as belarus russia kazakhstan and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation 

ukraine has been experiencing heightened political and economic turmoil with no improvement as of the date of this report various news sources estimate that inflation has been increasing and the rate of increase has been accelerating throughout 2014 according to news reports the peace talks continue and efforts to improve the government are in progress however the cost of the continuing crisis is severely impacting the ukrainian economy the ukrainian currency has been weakened and the negative outlook in the ukrainian economy continues the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in ukraine is us dollars 

due to russia’s annexation of crimea which was a part of ukraine the united states and the european union have imposed and expanded sanctions targeting russian government and governmentcontrolled interests and certain government officials the expanded sanctions issued by the us department of treasury and the european union also restrict involvement in certain extensions of credit and financing activities for russian debtors and restrict certain business activities in sectors such as offshore oil and defense we believe these sanctions do not prevent us from providing our services to our customers 

in february 2014 the government of kazakhstan devalued the local currency the tenge by 19 the government kept inflation for 2014 within forecasted range of 6 to 8 with forecast of around 7 for 2015 with a steady decrease towards 6 later that year however political and economic instability in the region may contribute to the economic uncertainty in kazakhstan 

belarus over the last several years has been experiencing hyperinflation the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments including increasing interest rates and the use of antimonopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize the local currency inflation government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed to economic uncertainty in belarus belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future for the year ended december 31 2014 we had approximately 15  or 02  of our revenues denominated in belarusian rubles the functional currency for financial reporting purposes in belarus is us dollars 

periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and as a result may reduce our profitability inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counterinflationary measures that may harm our financial condition results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 





 revenues

operating expenses 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries employee benefits stock compensation expense travel costs and subcontractor fees for it professionals and subcontractors that are assigned to client projects salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are reported as cost of revenue regardless of whether they are actually performing client services during a given period 

the cost of revenues are dependent on utilization levels our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately our staff utilization also depends on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services some of our it professionals are specifically hired and trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and general administrative functions of our business these expenses include senior management administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries stock compensation expense related fringe benefits commissions and travel costs for those employees legal and audit expenses insurance operating lease expenses and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues collected in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hitech park 

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2014 2013 and 2012 we had 942 698 million and 566 million respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory us tax rate additionally we have secured special tax benefits in belarus and hungary as described below as a result our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes due to the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18 the “on hightechnologies park” decree which created the belarus hitech park is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1 2006 

our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10 of annual qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 to 2012 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 however were allowed through 2014 we have utilized up to the 70 limit until 2014 

our domestic income before provision for income taxes differs from the north america segment income before provision for income taxes because segment operating profit is a management reporting measure which does not take into account most corporate expenses as well as the majority of nonoperating costs and stock compensation expenses we do not hold our segment managers accountable for these expenses as they cannot influence these costs within the scope of their operating authority nor do we believe it is practical to allocate these costs to specific segments as they are not directly attributable to any specific segment all our segments are treated consistently with respect to such expenses when determining segment operating profit 

2014  compared to 2013   

during 2014  our revenues grew in excess of 300 over 2013  from 5551 million  to a record 7300 million  the increase was attributable to a combination of factors including deeper penetration to existing customers and attainment of new customers both organically and through acquisitions in 2014 revenue from new customers was 497 million  primarily resulting from our 2014 acquisitions and does not include new clients that are affiliates of existing customers our 2014 acquisitions increased our total revenues by 398 million  however some of the acquired clients are affiliated with our existing clients and therefore we consider them an expansion of existing business in addition total revenues in 2014  and 2013  included 84 million  and 76 million  of reimbursable expenses and other revenues respectively which increased by 103  in 2014  as compared to 2013  but remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues

revenues in the cis geography showed a decrease of 98 million  or 149  on a yeartodate bases compared to 2013  the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to budgetary delays with certain customers located in russia as well as a decline in business from one of our largest customers in kazakhstan additionally significant foreign currency fluctuations in russia and cis countries had a material negative impact on the revenues from those locations

provision for income taxes 

the companys effective tax rate was 199  and 192  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the primary factors that caused this increase in the rate for the abovementioned periods are a the four acquisitions completed during 2014 which added other tax jurisdictions into the company’s worldwide effective tax rate analysis b a larger portion of the company’s pretax profits attributable to tax jurisdictions with relatively higher effective tax rates as compared to effective tax rates within the cis region were seen in 2014 and c a relative shift in offshore services that were performed in belarus to other countries in the cis region specifically ukraine and to a lesser extent russia both of those locations have higher income tax rates than belarus where the company is currently entitled to a 100 exemption from belarusian income tax

number of new customers in the fourth quarter of 2012 revenues from our travel and consumer vertical increased 27 million  or 491  in 2013 as compared with 2012 however that growth in the travel and consumer vertical was more than offset by a lower growth rate in the banking and financial services vertical the largest vertical in this geography which increased 26 million  or 81  in 2013 over 2012 in addition included in 2012 results were 40 million of revenues recognized upon completion of a fixedpriced project that did not recur in 2013

results by business segment 

our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available that is used on a regular basis by our chief executive 

officer who is also our chief operating decision maker “codm” in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some specific cases however managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team in a case like this the client’s activity would be reported through the management team’s reportable segment our codm evaluates the company’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit 

segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to similar factors pressures and challenges expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses we use globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources as a result a majority of our expenses is shared by all segments these shared expenses include delivery recruitment and development sales and marketing and support functions such as it finance legal and human resources generally shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense eg recorded hours or headcount however certain expenses are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against our total income from operations 

revenues from external clients and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe russia and other reportable segments for the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were as follows 



2014  compared to 2013 

north america segment 

during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  revenues from our north america segment were 513  and 513  of total revenues representing an increase of 899 million  or 316  over the corresponding period in 2013  the north america segments operating profits increased by 238 million  or 356  as compared to the same period of 2013  to 906 million  net operating profit 

the increase in revenues during the year ended december 31 2014  was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as our recent acquisitions the largest growth was in the other vertical due to acquiring new clients in the healthcare insurance and life sciences industries through a 2014  acquisition as well as creating synergies with existing customers in those markets during the year ended december 31 2014  combined revenue growth from customers in the other vertical accounted for 348 million representing a 974 growth over prior year 

all other verticals in the north america segment experienced revenue growth and increases in operating profit in 2014 as compared to 2013 mainly due to increased business from our long term clients with some contribution from the clients acquired in connection with acquisitions the largest vertical the isvs and technology grew revenues by 221 million or 186 in 2014 as compared to the corresponding period of 2013 revenues from our travel and consumer vertical in 2014 increased by 146 million or 267 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013 banking and financial services had an increase in revenue of 59 million or 454 and operating profit increased by 1049 in this vertical in 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 2013 business information and media grew in revenue 125 million or 20 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 

europe segment 

during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  revenues from our europe segment were 410  and 368  of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 951 million  or 466  in 2014 over the 2013  results during 2014 the europe segment’s operating profits increased by 156 million  or 452  as compared to the corresponding period of 2013  to 502 million  net profit from the segment’s operations 

europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio given our nearshore delivery capabilities and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services our business model continues to gain considerable traction with europeanbased clients primarily in the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals furthermore our europe segment benefited from the acquisition of jointech a company with locations in southeast asia which created a new value proposition for our existing customers within the banking and financial services vertical particularly in the areas of investment banking wealth and asset management and extended our reach into new geography we expect that many of our new and existing customers in other business verticals will use our services in that fastgrowing region resulting in possible revenue and operating profit increases to the europe segment 

russia and other segments 

during the years ended december 31 2014  revenues from the russia and other operating segments decreased by 51 million  and 49 million  respectively over corresponding period of 2013  operating profits of the russia segment showed no  changes when compared with the operating profits of this segment in 2013  while profits of other segments decreased 41 million  compared to 2013  

revenues and operating profits in the russia and other segments are subject to volatility resulting from revenue recognition delays related to finalizing budgets for certain arrangements with major customers in those segments as a result we recorded the cost related to the performance of services in 2014 with no associated revenues recognized in the period that services were rendered these business arrangements were further exacerbated by strong foreign currency fluctuations in the fourth quarter of 2014 negatively impacting our business in russia and cis countries 

2013 compared to 2012 

north america segment 

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from the north america segment were 513 and 455 of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 874 million or 443 in 2013 over the 2012 results the north america segments operating profits increased by 281 million or 728 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 668 million net profit from the segment’s operations 

the increase in revenues during year ended december 31 2013 was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing client relationships as well as by revenues contributed by new clients including through the acquisitions of thoughtcorp and empathy lab completed in 2012 within the segment revenue from our isvs and technology vertical increased 290 million or 323 in 2013 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 representing 332 of the overall segment growth our travel and consumer vertical was the fastest growing vertical in 2013 with revenues increasing by 265 million or 946 in 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012 the increase in the segment’s operating profit in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by increased revenues and improved profitability partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits of our it professionals primarily as a result of added headcount to support our revenue growth and continued demand for onsite resources 

europe segment 

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from our europe segment were 368 and 389 of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 352 million or 209 in 2013 over the 2012 results during 

2013 the europe segment’s operating profits increased by 18 million or 56 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 346 million net profit from the segment’s operations 

europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio given our nearshore delivery capabilities and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services is continuing to gain considerable traction with europeanbased clients within the segment growth was the strongest in our banking and financial services vertical with 2013 revenues increasing by approximately 369 million or 520 over the corresponding period of 2012 the decrease in the segment’s operating profit as a percentage of the european segment’s revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense relative to recognized service revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012 

russia segment 

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from our russia segment were 100 and 117 of total segment revenues respectively in 2013 revenues from the russia segment were 558 million representing an increase of 52 million or 103 over the 2012 results during 2013 our russia segments operating profits decreased by 20 million or 218 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 71 million net profit from the segment’s operations 

within the segment 2013 revenues from the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals increased 24 million and 28 million respectively accounting for most of the segments growth in the period indicated the decrease in operating profits of the russia segment in 2013 when compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to revenue recognition delays related to fixedprice projects revenue recognition on such projects is susceptible to timing delays as a result there may be instances where we record the cost related to the performance of services with no associated revenue recognized in the period that services were rendered in particular we estimate a total of 25 million of revenues remained unrecognized as of december 31 2013 in the russia segment with related costs reflected in the segments operating results for the year then ended similarly we may record revenue in a period where the underlying expenses have been recorded in a previous period which would significantly improve the operating margin of the russia segment in the period of recognition consequently a higher concentration of fixedprice projects in the russia segment affects the periodoverperiod comparability of the segment’s operating results 

other segment 

during the year ended december 31 2013 revenues from the other segment were 105 million or 19 of total segment revenues representing a decrease of 65 million or 382 from the 2012 results during 2013 our other segments operating profits decreased by 61 million as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 08 million 

the decrease in revenues and operating profits of the other segment in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to a completion of a large fixedpriced project in 2012 with 46 million revenues and 25 million operating profit recognized in 2012 that did not recur in 2013 in addition the fourth quarter of 2012 benefited significantly from fixedpriced project with one of our largest customers in that segment that did not recur in 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

at december 31 2014  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 2205 million  and 1000 million  of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of that date 1763 million  of our total cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states of this amount 338 million  was held in us dollar denominated accounts in belarus including deposits that accrued interest at an average interest rate of 41  during 2014  also at december 31 2014 758 million  in us dollars was held in a bank in uk by our cyprus entity which was repatriated from belarus earlier in the year and 144 million in russia our subsidiaries in the cis or apac regions do not maintain significant balances denominated in currencies other than us dollars 

the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds however if necessary there are no restrictions on repatriating those funds back to the united states if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends 1763 million  would be subject to foreign withholding taxes of which 1686 million  would also be subject to us corporate income tax we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flows increase our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside the us and the 

availability of public and private debt and equity financing to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions 

on september 12 2014 we entered into a new agreement establishing a revolving credit facility with pnc bank national association santander bank na and silicon valley bank collectively the “lenders” this credit facility the 2014 credit facility consists of a 1000 million  revolving line of credit with a maturity date of september 12 2019  there is potential to increase the credit facility up to 2000 million  if certain conditions are met borrowings under the 2014 credit facility may be denominated in united states dollars or up to a maximum of 500 million  in british pounds sterling canadian dollars euros or swiss francs or other currencies as may be approved by the lenders borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at either a base rate or eurorate plus a margin based on the company’s leverage ratio base rate is equal to the highest of a the federal funds open rate plus 05 b the prime rate and c the daily libor rate plus 10 the 2014 credit facility is secured by a all tangible and intangible assets of the company and its usbased subsidiaries including all accounts general intangibles intellectual property rights and equipment and b all of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests in usbased subsidiaries of the company and 65  of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests in certain of the company’s foreign subsidiaries 

 the line of credit also contains customary financial and reporting covenants and limitations we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our revolving line of credit and believe that our revolving line of credit provides sufficient flexibility such that we will remain in compliance with its terms in the foreseeable future at december 31 2014  we had no  borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 



operating activities 

net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31 2014 increased 466 million  to 1049 million  as compared to 582 million  net cash provided by operations in 2013 during 2014 operating cash flows benefited in part from our strong focus on improving working capital efficiencies during the latter part of 2013 including focus on reducing days outstanding for our billed and unbilled receivables this emphasis more than offset the higher working capital requirements associated with increased revenues including growth in total compensation and benefits of our it professionals overhead expenses and higher tax payments 

net cash provided by operations increased by 97 million  to 582 million  in 2013 from 485 million  net cash provided by operations in 2012 for 2013 net cash provided by operations was primarily comprised of net income of 223 million before accounting for noncash items such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization bad debt expense and other items aggregating to 148 million net increase in operating assets and liabilities in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily related to a reduction in prepaid and other assets by approximately 19 million as a result of nonrecurring purchases made in 2012 coupled with a net increase in accrued expenses and trade payables of 20 million mainly due to a decrease in third party contractor expenses this increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by higher billed and unbilled receivables of 76 million which was mainly driven by increased volumes and higher ratio of fixedpriced projects in 2013 as compared to 2012 and a 61 million decrease in other net liabilities the decrease in other net liabilities includes the effects of a higher portion of december salaries and related taxes released before the yearend in 2013 when compared to 2012 and a reduction in warranty revenues of 16 million related to several large nonrecurring projects completed in prior periods 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2014 increased 311 million  to 529 million  as compared to 218 million  used in investing activities during the corresponding period of 2013 the increase was primarily attributable to 371 million  spent on acquisitions of businesses partially offset by a net 62 million  decrease in loans issued under the employee housing program compared to the corresponding period last year 

net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31 2013 decreased by 378 million to 218 million as compared to 596 million of net cash used in investing activities in 2012 the decrease in cash spent on investing activities in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to an 111 million decrease in payments made in connection with the construction of corporate facilities in belarus combined with a 329 million decrease in payments made in connection with our 2012 acquisitions the decrease was partly offset by net payments of 58 million made by us in relation to employee loans issued under the employee housing program 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2014 was 103 million  a decrease of 52 million  from the same period in 2013 primarily due to payment of deferred consideration in the amount of 4 million  as well as a decrease in excess tax benefit on stockbased compensation plans partly offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 decreased by 233 million to 155 million as compared to 388 million provided by financing activities in 2012 this was primarily due to a net 306 million received in connection with our initial public offering of common stock in the first quarter of 2012 that did not recur in 2013 partially offset by an increase of 73 million in proceeds received by us in 2013 as a result of stock option exercises and associated tax benefits 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  





 future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future our ability to generate cash however is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in note 16   i n the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interests derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to us or engages in leasing hedging or research and development services with us 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the audited consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report 

revenue recognition — we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved at the time revenues are recognized we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms 

we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings which represent specific competencies of our it professionals contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition pattern fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements 

the majority of our revenues  847  of revenues in 2014  823  in 2013  and 841  in 2012  are generated under timeandmaterial contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client 

revenues from fixedprice contracts  136  of revenues in 2014  157  in 2013  and 137  in 2012  are determined using the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the client revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client in order to estimate the amount of revenue for the period under the proportional performance method we determine the percentage of actual labor hours incurred as compared to estimated total labor hours and apply that percentage to the consideration allocated to the deliverable the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related 

expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements a number of internal and external factors can affect such estimates including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known no significant revisions occurred in each of the three years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of 12 months or less 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as these expenses are billable to our clients 

fair value of financial instruments  — we make significant assumptions about fair values of its financial instruments fair value is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability we utilize the following fair value hierarchy in determining fair values 

level 1  quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 

level 2  inputs other than quoted prices within level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly including quoted prices in markets that are not active quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and observable inputs other than quoted prices such as interest rates or yield curves 

level 3  unobservable inputs reflecting our view about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 

where the fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet cannot be derived from an active market they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques these valuation techniques include a net present value technique comparison to similar instruments with market observable inputs options pricing models and other relevant valuation models inputs into these models are taken from observable market data whenever possible but in instances where it is not feasible a degree of judgment is required to establish fair values 

financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 

at december 31 2014  contingent liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis comprised contingent consideration payable in cash and stock performancebased awards issued to certain former owners of acquired businesses in exchange for future services and certain other contractual liabilities 

we estimate the fair value of contingent liabilities based on certain performance milestones of the acquired businesses and estimated probabilities of achievement then discount the liabilities to present value using our cost of debt for the cash component of contingent consideration and risk free rate for the stock component of a contractual contingency contingent liabilities are valued using significant inputs that are not observable in the market which are defined as level 3 inputs pursuant to fair value measurement accounting we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable however there is significant judgment involved changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the timing and amount of specific milestone estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earnout criteria these changes could cause a material impact to and volatility in our operating results 

financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 

we issue loans to our employees under the employee housing program “housing loans” housing loans are issued in us dollars with a 5year term and carry an interest rate of 75 the program was designed to be a retention mechanism for our employees in belarus 

although permitted by authoritative guidance we did not elect a fair value option for these financial instruments these housing loans are measured at fair value upon initial recognition and subsequently carried at amortized cost less allowance for loan losses any difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a loan upon initial recognition “dayone” recognition is charged to expense 

the housing loans were classified as level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using significant unobservable inputs the estimated fair value of these housing loans upon initial recognition was computed by projecting the future contractual cash flows to be received from the loans and discounting those projected net cash flows to a present value which is the estimated fair value the “income approach” in applying the income approach we analyzed similar loans offered by thirdparty financial institutions in belarusian rubles “byr” and adjusted the interest rates charged on such loans to exclude the effects of underlying economic factors such as inflation and currency devaluation we also assessed the probability of future defaults and associated cash flows impact in addition we separately analyzed the rate of return that market participants in belarus would require when investing in unsecured usddenominated government bonds 

with similar maturities a “riskfree rate” and evaluated a risk premium component to compensate the market participants for the credit and liquidity risks inherent in the loans’ cash flows as described in the following paragraph as a result of the analysis performed we determined the carrying values of the housing loans issued during the year ended december 31 2014  approximated their fair values upon initial recognition we also estimated the fair values of the housing loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2014  using the inputs noted above and determined their fair values approximated the carrying values as of that date 

repayment of housing loans is primarily dependent on personal income of borrowers obtained through employment with epam which income is set in us dollars and is not closely correlated with common macroeconomic risks existing in belarus such as inflation local currency devaluation and decrease in the purchasing power of the borrowers’ income given a large demand for the program among our employees and its advantages as compared to alternative methods of financing available on the market we expect the borrowers to fulfill their obligations and we estimate the probability of voluntary termination of employment among the borrowers as de minimis additionally housing loans are capped at 50 thousand per loan and secured by real estate financed through the program we establish a maximum loantovalue ratio of 70 and expect a decrease in the ratio over the life of a housing loan due to ongoing payments by employees 

business combinations — we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired including related goodwill and other intangible assets we identify and attribute fair values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired and allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples there are different valuation models for each component the selection of which requires considerable judgment these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe are reasonable but recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain 

if initial accounting for the business combination has not been completed by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs provisional amounts are reported for which the accounting is incomplete with retrospective adjustment made to such provisional amounts during the measurement period to present new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date once the measurement period ends and in no case beyond one  year from the acquisition date revisions of the accounting for the business combination are recorded in earnings 

all acquisitionrelated costs other than the costs to issue debt or equity securities are accounted for as expense in the period in which they are incurred changes in fair value of contingent consideration arrangements that are not measurement period adjustments are recognized in earnings payments to settle contingent consideration if any are reflected in cash flows from financing activities and the changes in fair value are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal assets typically acquired are customer relationships trade names noncompetition agreements and workforce as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets — goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are treated consistently with asc 350 they are tested annually for impairment and are not amortized events or circumstances that might require impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of the asset’s carrying value using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that utilize a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model over the remaining asset life the estimates of future cash flows attributable to intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  all of our intangible assets had finite lives and we did not incur any impairment losses in respect of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  or 2012  

effective in the fourth quarter of 2013 we changed the annual goodwill impairment assessment date for all of our reporting units from december 31 st  to october 31 st  which represented a voluntary change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date we are also required to assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment between annual assessment dates 

when events or circumstances dictate we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level and we had three reporting units that had recorded goodwill which were subject to the annual impairment testing in 2014  our annual impairment review as of october 31 2014  resulted in an impairment charge for the russian reporting unit there was no impairment charge for any of these reporting units as of october 31 2013  

for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values in order to determine if impairment is indicated if so the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to its carrying amount and the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value the fair values are estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings multiples based on market data these valuations are considered level 3 measurements under fasb asc topic 820 we utilize estimates to determine the fair value of the reporting units such as future cash flows growth rates capital requirements effective tax rates and projected margins among other factors estimates utilized in the future evaluations of goodwill for impairment could differ from estimates used in the current period calculations 

when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of the asset’s carrying value using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that utilize a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model over the remaining asset life the estimates of future cash flows attributable to intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value 

income taxes —   the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the audited consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” was signed into law on january 2 2013 because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment certain provisions of the act benefiting our 2012 us federal taxes including the subpart f controlled foreign corporation lookthrough exception were not recognized in our 2012 financial results and instead were reflected in our 2013 financial results 

stockbased compensation  — equitybased compensation cost relating to the issuance of sharebased awards to employees is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant which is expensed ratably over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeiture assumptions may affect the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period the service period is the period over which the employee performs the related services which is normally the same as the vesting period equitybased awards that do not require future service are expensed immediately equitybased awards that do not meet criteria for equity classification are recorded in liabilities and adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period distributions associated with liabilityclassified awards not expected to vest are accounted for as compensation expense in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 13   i n the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our audited consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and concentration of credit risks in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

concentration of credit and other credit risks 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of employee loans receivable cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues 

at december 31 2014  outstanding loans issued to employees were 65 million  or 11  of our total assets these loans potentially expose us to a risk of nonpayment and loss repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of borrowers obtained through their employment with epam and may be adversely affected by macroeconomic changes such as higher unemployment levels currency devaluation and inflation additionally the continuing financial stability of a borrower may be adversely affected by job loss divorce illness or personal bankruptcy we also face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses if any and costs of foreclosure decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from either the borrower andor guarantors 

we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties as of december 31 2014  593 million  of total cash was held in cis countries with 342 million  of that in belarus and 144 million in russia banking and other financial systems in the cis region are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis region generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and bank deposits made by corporate entities in the cis region are not insured the cis banking sector remains subject to periodic instability and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards particularly in belarus a banking crisis bankruptcy or insolvency of banks that process or hold our funds may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis region which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across our clients in proportion to their revenues as of december 31 2014  unbilled trade receivables from one  customer ubs ag individually exceeded 10 and accounted for 165  of our total unbilled trade receivables as of that date there were no  customers individually exceeding 10 of our billed trade receivables as of december 31 2014  

during the year ended   december 31 2014  our top five customers accounted for 328  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 439  of our total revenues respectively during the year ended   december 31 2013  our top five customers accounted for 306  of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 423  of our total revenues respectively 

during the year ended   december 31 2014  the company had one  customer ubs ag  with associated revenues of 976 million  which accounted for more than 10 of total revenues in the periods indicated no customers generated revenues individually exceeding 10 of total revenues during the year ended   december 31 2013  

credit losses and writeoffs of trade accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our audited consolidated financial statements   

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk is mainly influenced by the changes in interest rates received on our cash and cash equivalent deposits and paid on any outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit which is subject to a variety of rates depending on the type and term of funds borrowed as of december 31 2014 we have not borrowed under the line of credit and did not have any outstanding debt we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility 

we also do not believe that employee loans issued by us under the employee housing program expose us to significant interest rate risks these loans are designed to be a retention mechanism for our employees in belarus and are financed with available funds of our belarusian subsidiary 

we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates however our future interest expense may increase and interest income may fall due to changes in market interest rates 

foreign exchange risk 

our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to variety of countries and currencies in which we conduct business outside of the united states we operate primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in canada europe asia and the cis and cee regions and generate a significant portion of our revenues in currencies other than the us dollar principally euros british pounds sterling canadian dollars and russian rubles we incur expenditures in nonus dollar currencies principally in hungarian forints euros russian rubles polish zlotys hong kong dollars and china yuan renminbi “cny” associated with our delivery centers located in the cee europe and apac regions we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in these foreign currencies and cash outflows for expenditures in foreign currencies we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange volatility our results of operations can be affected if any of the currencies which we use materially in our business appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues and expenses based on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014  a 10 appreciationdepreciation of all applicable foreign currencies against the us dollar would result in an estimated increasedecrease of approximately 09 million  in our net income respectively based on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014  and included in the analysis of the previous sentence a 10 appreciationdepreciation of eur and gbp currencies against the us dollar would each result in an estimated increasedecrease of approximately 05 million  in net income 

to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations the analysis quantifies the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period most commonly within a oneyear period the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible during the forecast period fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices changes in the currency exchange rates resulted in our reporting a net transactional foreign currency exchange losses of 22 million  and 25 million  during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in net foreign exchange loss for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily attributable to changes in exchange rates of russian ruble and ukrainian hryvnya against us dollar in the periods indicated including realized losses from foreign currency conversions these losses are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

additionally foreign currency translation adjustments from translating financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from functional currency to the us dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity or included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income if local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries differ from their functional currencies as of december 31 2014  approximately 219  of our total net assets were subject to foreign currency translation exposure as compared to 216  as of december 31 2013  during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  net income generated by foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency was not us dollars was 351  and 296  respectively during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  we recorded 203 million  and 08 million  of translation losses respectively within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

1a   risk factors 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements”

risks relating to our business

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources

we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business over the past several years our revenues grew from 1606 million in 2008 to 5551 million in 2013 we have also supplemented our organic growth with strategic acquisitions as of december 31 2013 we had 9340 it professionals as compared to 2890 it professionals as of december 31 2007 we intend to continue our expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities

our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure continued expansion increases the challenges we face in

•   recruiting training and retaining sufficiently skilled it professionals and management personnel 

•   adhering to and further improving our highquality and process execution standards and maintaining high levels of client satisfaction

•   managing a larger number of clients in a greater number of industries and locations 

•   maintaining effective oversight of personnel and delivery centers 

•   preserving our culture values and entrepreneurial environment and 

•   developing and improving our internal administrative infrastructure particularly our financial operational communications and other internal systems

as a result of these problems associated with expansion our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

moreover we intend to continue our expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological and operational risks and challenges with which we are unfamiliar and we may not be able to mitigate these risks and challenges to successfully grow those services or markets we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth which could materially adversely affect our business and prospects

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled it professionals we may not have the necessary resources to properly staff projects and failure to successfully compete for such it professionals could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to our clients

our success depends largely on the contributions of our it professionals and our ability to attract and retain qualified it professionals competition for it professionals in the markets in which we operate can be intense and accordingly we may not be able to retain or hire all of the it professionals necessary to meet our ongoing and future business needs any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire it professionals to meet our business requirements

the total attrition rates among our it professionals who have worked for us for at least six months were 131 107 and 91 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we may encounter higher attrition rates in the future a significant increase in the attrition rate among it professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services the competition for highlyskilled it professionals may require us to increase salaries and we may be unable to pass on these increased costs to our clients

in addition our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain skilled it professionals including experienced management it professionals which enables us to keep pace with growing demands for outsourcing evolving industry standards and changing client preferences if we are unable to attract and retain the highlyskilled it professionals we need we may have to forgo projects for lack of resources or be unable to staff projects optimally our failure to attract train and retain it professionals with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new it professionals successfully could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to our clients

increases in wages and other compensation expense for our it professionals could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage

wage costs for it professionals in cis and cee countries are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the cis and cee it services industry may increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our it professionals as well as the prices we can charge for our services increases in wage costs may reduce our profitability

additionally we have granted certain options under our stock incentive plans and entered into certain other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past as a result of which we have recorded 132 million 68 million and 29 million as stockbased compensation expenses for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively

generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” prescribe how we account for stockbased compensation which could adversely or negatively impact our results of operations or the price of our common stock gaap requires us to recognize stockbased compensation as compensation expense in the statement of operations generally based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of the grant with compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the number of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations the issuance of equitybased compensation to our it professionals would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees we currently do not maintain key man life insurance for any of the senior members of our management team or other key personnel if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted

if any of our senior executives or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients suppliers knowhow and key it professionals and staff members to them also if any of our business development managers who generally keep a close relationship with our clients joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients and our revenues may be materially adversely affected additionally there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge practices or procedures by such personnel if any dispute arises between our senior executives or key personnel and us any noncompetition nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key personnel might not provide effective protection to us especially in cis and cee countries where some of our senior executives and most of our key employees reside in light of uncertainties with legal systems in cis and cee countries

emerging markets such as the cis and cee countries are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks

we have significant operations in cis and cee countries which are generally considered to be emerging markets cee includes albania belarus bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland republic of macedonia romania russia serbia and montenegro slovakia slovenia the former yugoslav republic of macedonia turkey and ukraine the cis is comprised of constituents of the former ussr including armenia azerbaijan belarus georgia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan moldova russia tajikistan turkmenistan ukraine and uzbekistan investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including complying with foreign laws and regulations and the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or sanctions tax increases fluctuations in exchange rates inflation and unstable political and military situations and labor issues investors should also note that emerging economies such as the economies of belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan and hungary are subject to rapid change and that the information set forth in this annual report may become outdated relatively quickly accordingly investors should exercise particular care in evaluating the risks involved and must decide for themselves whether in light of those risks an investment in our common stock is appropriate

our ukrainian and russian operations may be adversely affected by ongoing developments in the ukraine

ukraine has been undergoing heightened political turmoil since the removal of president yanukovych from power by the ukrainian parliament in late february 2014 which was followed by reports of russian military activity in the crimean region the situation in the ukraine is rapidly developing and we cannot predict the outcome of developments there or the reaction to such developments by us european un or other international authorities

we have delivery centers in the ukraine employing approximately 2600 engineers none of which are located in crimea we also have delivery centers in russia employing approximately 1300 personnel located in various cities including moscow and st petersburg at present we have not experienced any interruption in our office infrastructure utility supply or internet connectivity all epam offices remain open and fully functional including those we use in the ukraine and russia to support our clients we continue to monitor the situation closely our contingency plans include relocating work or personnel to other locations and adding new locations as appropriate we have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation as the political and civil unrest and reported military activities are fluid and beyond our control prolonged unrest military activities or broadbased sanctions should they be implemented could have a material adverse effect on our operations

we generate a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of clients and any loss of business from these clients could materially reduce our revenues

our ability to maintain close relationships with our major clients is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for a specific client is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our clients’ exclusive it services provider and we do not have longterm commitments from any clients to purchase our services

a major client in one year may not provide the same level of revenues for us in any subsequent year the it services we provide to our clients and the revenues and net income from those services may decline or vary as the type and quantity of it services we provide change over time furthermore our reliance on any individual client for a significant portion of our revenues may give that client a certain degree of pricing leverage against us when negotiating contracts and terms of service

in addition a number of factors other than our performance could cause the loss of or reduction in business or revenues from a client and these factors are not predictable for example a client may decide to reduce spending on technology services or sourcing from us due to a challenging economic environment or other factors both internal and external relating to its business these factors among others may include corporate restructuring pricing pressure changes to its outsourcing strategy switching to another it services provider or returning work inhouse

the loss of any of our major clients or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations

our revenues operating results and profitability may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult to make accurate financial forecasts

our revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future which could make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts factors that are likely to cause these variations include

•   the number timing scope and contractual terms of it projects in which we are engaged 

•   delays in project commencement or staffing delays due to difficulty in assigning appropriately skilled or experienced it professionals

•   the accuracy of estimates of resources time and fees required to complete fixedprice projects and costs incurred in the performance of each project

•   changes in pricing in response to client demand and competitive pressures 

•   changes in the allocation of onsite and offshore staffing 

•   the business decisions of our clients regarding the use of our services 

•   the ability to further grow revenues from existing clients 

•   the available leadership and senior technical resources compared to junior engineering resources staffed on each project 

•   seasonal trends primarily our hiring cycle and the budget and work cycles of our clients 

•   delays or difficulties in expanding our operational facilities or infrastructure 

•   the ratio of fixedprice contracts to timeandmaterials contracts in process 

•   employee wage levels and increases in compensation costs including timing of promotions and annual pay increases 

•   unexpected changes in the utilization rate of our it professionals 

•   unanticipated contract or project terminations 

•   the timing of collection of accounts receivable 

•   the continuing financial stability of our clients and 

•   general economic conditions 

if we are unable to make accurate financial forecasts it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we do not have longterm commitments from our clients and our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts

our clients are generally not obligated for any longterm commitments to us although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from repeated business which we define as revenues from a client who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature in addition our clients can terminate many of our master services agreements and work orders with or without cause and in most cases without any cancellation charge therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated as well as maintain relationships with existing clients and secure new clients to expand our business

there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including

•   financial difficulties for the client 

•   a change in strategic priorities resulting in elimination of the impetus for the project or a reduced level of technology spending

•   a change in outsourcing strategy resulting in moving more work to the client’s inhouse technology departments or to our competitors

•   the replacement by our clients of existing software with packaged software supported by licensors and 

•   mergers and acquisitions or significant corporate restructurings 

failure to perform or observe any contractual obligations could result in cancellation or nonrenewal of a contract which could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and an increase in our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount the ability of our clients to terminate agreements makes our future revenues uncertain we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us which could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations

in addition some of our agreements specify that if a change of control of our company occurs during the term of the agreement the client has the right to terminate the agreement if any future event triggers any changeofcontrol provision in our client contracts these master services agreements may be terminated which would result in loss of revenues

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states or europe could reduce our revenues and thus adversely affect our results of operations

the recent crisis in the financial and credit markets in north america europe and asia led to a global economic slowdown with the economies of those regions showing significant signs of weakness the it services industry is particularly sensitive to the economic environment and tends to decline during general economic downturns we derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients in north america and europe if the north american or european economies further weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our clients may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability

if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our results of operations could be adversely affected

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization levels and productivity levels

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization levels of fixedcost resources including human resources as well as other resources such as computers and office space and our ability to increase our productivity levels we have expanded our operations significantly in recent years through organic growth and strategic acquisitions which has resulted in a significant increase in our headcount and fixed overhead costs

some of our it professionals are specially trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any client or on any project for which we have dedicated it professionals or facilities we may not be able to efficiently reallocate these it professionals and facilities to other clients and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer

we face intense competition from onshore and offshore it services companies and increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business

the market for it services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are reputation and track record industry expertise breadth and depth of service offerings quality of the services offered language marketing and selling skills scalability of infrastructure ability to address clients’ timing requirements and price

we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations clients tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other competing it services providers clients may prefer it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some cis and cee countries

our ability to compete successfully also depends in part on a number of factors beyond our control including the ability of our competitors to recruit train develop and retain highlyskilled it professionals the price at which our competitors offer comparable services and our competitors’ responsiveness to client needs some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources our current and potential competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands may be able to devote greater resources towards the development promotion and sale of their services than we can and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients client buying patterns can change if clients become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our clients while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our delivery centers such as in minsk belarus we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations

a substantial portion of our clients is concentrated in four specific industry verticals banking and financial services isvs and technology business information and media and travel and consumer clients in banking and financial services accounted for 282 258 and 229 of our revenues in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively clients in isvs and technology accounted for 243 246 and 252 of our revenues in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these four industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource it services

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example a worsening of economic conditions in the financial services industry and significant consolidation in that industry may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability

other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services in these industries and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes for example consolidation in any of these industries or acquisitions particularly involving our clients may decrease the potential number of buyers of our services our clients may experience rapid changes in their prospects substantial price competition and pressure on their profitability this in turn may result in increasing pressure on us from clients in these key industries to lower our prices which could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected

to successfully market our service offerings and obtain larger and more complex projects we need to establish close relationships with our clients and develop a thorough understanding of their operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including

•   maintaining highquality control and process execution standards 

•   maintaining planned resource utilization rates on a consistent basis 

•   maintaining productivity levels and implementing necessary process improvements 

•   controlling costs 

•   maintaining close client contact and high levels of client satisfaction and 

•   maintaining effective client relationships 

our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our management personnel and it professionals some of whom do not have experience managing largescale or complex projects in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements a failure by us to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business impact our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose clients and our business could be materially adversely affected

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards characterize the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in it services enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing client needs the process of developing our client solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep up with technology methodology and business changes is subject to a number of risks including that

•   we may find it difficult or costly to update our services applications tools and software and to develop new services quickly enough to meet our clients’ needs

•   we may find it difficult or costly to make some features of our software work effectively and securely over the internet or with new or changed operating systems

•   we may find it difficult or costly to update our software and services to keep pace with business evolving industry standards methodologies regulatory and other developments in the industries where our clients operate and

•   we may find it difficult to maintain a high level of quality in implementing new technologies and methodologies 

we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our clients could cause us to lose clients and materially adversely affect our business

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services

we have a long selling cycle for our it services which requires significant investment of human resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients’ decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other it services providers or inhouse resources and the timing of our clients’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and hinder our revenue growth for certain clients we may begin work and incur costs prior to concluding the contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our clients may experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology thereby further delaying the implementation process our current and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to whom we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could materially adversely affect our business

we may not be able to recognize revenues in the period in which our services are performed which may cause our margins to fluctuate

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice contract arrangements all revenues are recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards we recognize revenues when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved

additionally we recognize revenues from fixedprice contracts based on the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the system or solution is specified by the client revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client our failure to meet all the acceptance criteria or otherwise meet a client’s expectations may result in our having to record the cost related to the performance of services in the period that services were rendered but delay the timing of revenue recognition to a future period in which all acceptance criteria have been met

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform sometimes include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable

in addition a number of our contracts contain pricing terms that condition a portion of the payment of fees by the client on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules set forth in the contracts our failure to meet such performance goals service levels or completion schedules or our failure to meet client expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates

our profitability and operating results are dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services our rates are affected by a number of factors including

•   our clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services 

•   our competitors’ pricing policies 

•   bid practices of clients and their use of thirdparty vendors 

•   the mix of onsite and offshore staffing 

•   employee wage levels and increases in compensation costs including timing of promotions and annual pay increases 

•   our ability to charge premium prices when justified by market demand or the type of service and 

•   general economic conditions 

if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profitability could suffer

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients weak macroeconomic conditions and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected moreover in the event of delays in payment from our governmental and quasigovernmental clients we may have difficulty collecting on receivables owed in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be materially adversely affected

our ability to generate and retain business depends on our reputation in the marketplace

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees

however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business including operations marketing sales and delivery functions us transfer pricing regulations as well as regulations applicable in cis and cee countries in which we operate require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be on arm’slength terms we consider the transactions among our subsidiaries to be on arm’slength terms the determination of our consolidated provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions

if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including as a result of a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business

our earnings could be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in the cis and cee or such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis

we do not accrue incremental us taxes on all cis and cee earnings as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2013 these increased taxes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus hungary and russia to companies in our industry

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are exempt or levied at a reduced rate on a variety of taxes including a 100 exemption from belarusian income tax which as of the date of this annual report was 18 and an exemption from the value added tax for a period of 15 consecutive years effective july 1 2006 in addition our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10 of qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 to 2012 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 however will be allowed through 2014 we anticipate full utilization up to the 70 limit until 2014 with full phase out in 2015 our subsidiary in russia benefits from a substantially reduced rate on social contributions and an exemption on value added tax in certain circumstances which is a benefit to qualified it companies in russia if the tax holiday relating to our belarusian subsidiary the tax incentives relating to our hungarian subsidiary or the lower tax rates and social contributions relating to our russian subsidiary are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —provision for income taxes”

changes in or interpretations of accounting principles could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission “sec” and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow gaap under sec regulations and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting

our agreement with one of our largest clients gives it the option to assume the operations of one of our offshore development centers and the exercise of that option could result in a loss of future revenues and adversely affect our results of operations

during the fouryear term of our agreement with one of our largest clients which ends in december 2014 unless extended by the client the client is entitled to request us to transfer to it or its designees all of the operating relationships including employment relationships with the employees dedicated to the offshore development center and contracts with subcontractors at a predetermined transfer price dependent on the experience level of the transferred employee and the duration such employee worked on projects for the client we are required to transfer assets that have already been financed by the client under our agreement such as our offshore development center dedicated to the client at a de minimis preagreed price since our client has already financed such assets the carrying value of such assets is de minimis in addition to the above amounts the client is also required to pay a negotiated value or book value for the assets to be transferred that have not already been financed by the client this client accounted for 96 92 and 63 of our revenues in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively in addition under our agreement the client has the right to step in and take over all or part of the offshore development center in certain instances including if we are in material default under certain provisions of our agreement such as those related to the level or quality of our services or the client has determined it is otherwise obliged to do so in emergencies or for regulatory reasons in the event the client takes over any services we provide under our agreement it will not be obligated to pay us for the provision of those services if the client exercises these rights we would lose future revenues related to the services we provide to the client as well as lose some of our assets and key employees and our losses may not be fully covered by the contractual payment which could adversely affect our results of operations

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our services or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current clients and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of client data a failure to attract new clients or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot provide assurance that despite testing by our clients and us errors will not be found in new software product development solutions which could result in litigation and other claims for damages against us and thus could materially adversely affect our business

disruptions in internet infrastructure telecommunications or significant failure in our it systems could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenue

part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications financial control accounting customer service and other data processing systems between our clients’ offices our delivery centers and our client management locations including our headquarters in newtown pa our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these internet it or communication systems which could be caused by among other things software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrading damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online or increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenue or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation

our computer networks may be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt our services and cause us to incur losses or liabilities that could adversely affect our business

our computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses worms malicious applications and other security problems caused by unauthorized access to or improper use of systems by third parties or employees a hacker who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information including personally identifiable information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations although we intend to continue to implement security measures computer attacks or disruptions may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems actual or perceived concerns that our systems may be vulnerable to such attacks or disruptions may deter our clients from using our solutions or services as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches

data networks are also vulnerable to attacks unauthorized access and disruptions for example in a number of public networks hackers have bypassed firewalls and misappropriated confidential information including personally identifiable information it is possible that despite existing safeguards an employee could misappropriate our clients’ proprietary information or data exposing us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability losses or liabilities that are incurred as a result of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business

if we cause disruptions to our clients’ businesses or provide inadequate service our clients may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose clients have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations

if our it professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our clients or fail to consistently meet service requirements of a client these errors or failures could disrupt the client’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us in addition a failure or inability to meet a contractual requirement could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business

the services we provide are often critical to our clients’ businesses certain of our client contracts require us to comply with security obligations including maintaining network security and backup data ensuring our network is virusfree maintaining business continuity planning procedures and verifying the integrity of employees that work with our clients by conducting background checks any failure in a client’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us any significant failure of our equipment or systems or any major disruption to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications in the locations in which we operate could impede our ability to provide services to our clients have a negative impact on our reputation cause us to lose clients and adversely affect our results of operations

under our contracts with our clients our liability for breach of our obligations is in some cases limited pursuant to the terms of the contract such limitations may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages in addition certain liabilities such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients are generally not limited under our contracts the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us in amounts greater than those covered by our current insurance policies could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations even if such assertions against us are unsuccessful we may incur reputational harm and substantial legal fees

our subcontracting practices may expose us to technical uncertainties potential liabilities and reputational harm

in order to meet our personnel needs increase workforce flexibility and improve pricing competitiveness we use subcontractors and freelancers primarily to perform shortterm assignments in certain specialty areas or on other projects where it is impractical to use our employees or where we need to supplement our resources we also use subcontractors for internal assignments such as assisting in development of internal systems recruiting training human resources consulting and administration and other similar support functions despite certain advantages of subcontracting such arrangements also give rise to a number of risks

although we try to source competent and credible third parties as our subcontractors they may not be able to deliver the level of service that our clients expect us to deliver furthermore we enter into confidentiality agreements with our subcontractors but we cannot guarantee that they will not breach the confidentiality of us or our clients and misappropriate our or our clients’ proprietary information and technology in the course of providing service we as the party to the contract with the client are directly responsible for the losses our subcontractors cause our clients under the subcontracting agreements we enter into our subcontractors generally promise to indemnify us for damages caused by their breach but we may be unable to collect under these agreements moreover their breaches may damage our reputation cause us to lose existing business and adversely affect our ability to acquire new business in the future

our employee loans expose us to lending risks

at december 31 2013 we had 64 million or 15 of our total assets of loans issued to employees these loans expose us to a risk of nonpayment and loss repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on personal income of borrowers obtained though their employment with epam and may be adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic situations such as higher unemployment levels foreign currency devaluation and inflation additionally continuing financial stability of the borrower may be adversely affected by job loss divorce illness or personal bankruptcy we also face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses if any and costs of foreclosure decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from either the borrower andor guarantors see note 5 of our consolidated financial statements in part iv “item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules — audited consolidated financial statements” for further information regarding these loans

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our it professionals or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged

some of our it professionals are retained as independent contractors although we believe that we have properly classified these individuals as independent contractors there is nevertheless a risk that the irs or another federal state provincial or foreign authority will take a different view furthermore the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities if a federal state provincial or foreign authority or court enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs under such laws and regulations including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there is also a risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged noncompliance with federal state provincial or foreign tax laws further if it were determined that any of our independent contractors should be treated as employees we could possibly incur additional liabilities under our applicable employee benefit plans

in addition we have classified all of our us employees as “exempt” under the federal labor standards act or the flsa if it were determined that any of our us employees should be classified as “nonexempt” under the flsa we may incur costs and liabilities for back wages unpaid overtime fines or penalties andor be subject to employee litigation

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources

most of the agreements we have entered into with our clients require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in cis and cee countries although to date no client has brought any claims against us for such failure our clients have the right to terminate these agreements as a result of such failure

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to defend and hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliates harmless with respect to claims related to matters including our breach of certain representations warranties or covenants or out of our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct and certain other claims payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement and any claims under these agreements may not be subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements so they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations

we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by a violation of intellectual property rights the disclosure of other confidential information including personally identifiable information system failures errors or unsatisfactory performance of services and our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover these damages

we often have access to and are required to collect and store sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information some of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for breaches of confidentiality infringement indemnity and certain other matters furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws the protection of the intellectual property rights and other confidential information or personally identifiable information of our clients is particularly important for us since our operations are mainly based in cis and cee countries cis and cee countries have not traditionally enforced intellectual property protection to the same extent as countries such as the united states despite measures we take to protect the intellectual property and other confidential information or personally identifiable information of our clients unauthorized parties including our employees and subcontractors may attempt to misappropriate certain intellectual property rights that are proprietary to our clients or otherwise breach our clients’ confidences unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients

many of our contracts involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients’ businesses and provide benefits to our clients that may be difficult to quantify any failure in a client’s system or any breach of security could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure furthermore any errors by our employees in the performance of services for a client or poor execution of such services could result in a client terminating our engagement and seeking damages from us

although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in rendering our services these limitations on liability may not apply in all circumstances may be unenforceable in some cases or may be insufficient to protect us from liability for damages there may be instances when liabilities for damages are greater than the insurance coverage we hold and we will have to internalize those losses damages and liabilities not covered by our insurance

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights implementation of intellectual propertyrelated laws in cis and cee countries has historically been lacking primarily because of ambiguities in the laws and difficulties in enforcement accordingly protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in cis and cee countries may not be as effective as that in the united states or other countries

to protect our and our clients’ proprietary information and other intellectual property we require our employees independent contractors vendors and clients to enter into written confidentiality agreements with us these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technology reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our clients’ technologies tools and applications without paying us for doing so and our clients may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register several of these trademarks we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks for instance in 2005 we entered into a consent of use and settlement agreement that allowed a third party to use the mark “epam” as capitalized in the foregoing and restricted our ability to do so in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention

in addition we rely on certain thirdparty software to conduct our business if we lose the licenses which permit us to use such software they may be difficult to replace and it may be costly to do so

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties we typically indemnify clients who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our clients redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our clients may be forced to stop using our services or solutions

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms in addition we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies

further our current and former employees andor subcontractors could challenge our exclusive rights in the software they have developed in the course of their employment in russia and certain other countries in which we operate an employer is deemed to own the copyright in works created by its employees during the course and within the scope of their employment but the employer may be required to satisfy additional legal requirements in order to make further use and dispose of such works while we believe that we have complied with all such requirements and have fulfilled all requirements necessary to acquire all rights in software developed by our independent contractors andor subcontractors these requirements are often ambiguously defined and enforced as a result we cannot assure that we would be successful in defending against any claim by our current or former employees independent contractors andor subcontractors challenging our exclusive rights over the use and transfer of works those employees independent contractors andor subcontractors created or requesting additional compensation for such works

we are subject to additional risks as a result of our recent and possible future acquisitions and the hiring of new employees who may misappropriate intellectual property from their former employers the developers of the technology that we have acquired or may acquire may not have appropriately created maintained or enforced intellectual property rights in such technology indemnification and other rights under acquisition documents may be limited in term and scope and may therefore provide little or no protection from these risks parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business a successful infringement claim against us whether with or without merit could among others things require us to pay substantial damages develop noninfringing technology or rebrand our name or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and would require us to cease making licensing or using products that have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential clients deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our clients against infringement claims in certain instances any intellectual property claim or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations or unfavorable interpretation by authorities of these regulations could harm our business

because we provide it services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations particularly in the cis and cee countries in which we operate our systems and operations are located almost entirely in the cis and cee and laws and regulations that are applicable to us but not to our competitors may impede our ability to develop and offer services that compete effectively with those offered by our noncis or cee based competitors and generally available worldwide violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our

 

business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate concerning our operations including export restrictions us economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures

our operations are subject to laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international economic sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and other laws concerning our international operations the fcpa’s foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions although varying in both scope and jurisdiction we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices

we have recently developed and are in the process of implementing formal controls and procedures to ensure that we are in compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and similar sanctions laws and regulations the implementation of such procedures may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware

any violations of these laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or restrictions on export activities including other us laws and regulations as well as foreign and local laws and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws if we are not in compliance with export restrictions us or international economic sanctions or other laws and regulations that apply to our operations we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures

antioutsourcing legislation and restrictions on immigration if adopted may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline

the vast majority of our employees are nationals of cis and cee countries some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our clients’ facilities which are sometimes located outside the cis and cee the ability of our employees to work in the united states europe the cis and cee and other countries outside the cis and cee depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits historically the process for obtaining visas for nationals of cis and cee countries to certain countries including the united states and europe has been lengthy and cumbersome immigration laws in the united states and in other countries are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions

in addition the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues

many organizations and public figures in the united states and europe have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing it services providers and the loss of jobs in their home countries for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies are currently under consideration in congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs in the united states in particular it is possible that pending legislation in the united states may impose restrictions on our ability to deploy employees holding us work visas to client locations which could adversely impact our ability to do business in the jurisdictions in which we have clients it is generally difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or maintaining business visas for our employees however if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain work visas our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional

costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our clients on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline

similarly legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in european jurisdictions or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of services from an offshore location could also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to an it services provider or changes its current it services provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous it services provider are entitled to become employees of the new it services provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous it services provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other european union countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation could materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and european union and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and european union in a costeffective manner

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore it services providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore it services provider any slowdown or reversal of the existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the country in which our clients operate

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties

revenues from clients outside north america represented 478 508 and 488 of our revenues excluding reimbursable expenses for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we anticipate that clients outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe and the cis in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in the cis and cee as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions

additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not impede the success of our international expansion plans or limit our ability to compete effectively in other countries

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies are difficult to integrate divert management resources or do not perform to our expectations we may not be able to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisitions and our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected

on occasion we have expanded our service capabilities and gained new clients through selective acquisitions our ability to successfully integrate an acquired entity and realize the benefits of an acquisition requires among other things successful integration of technologies operations and personnel challenges we face in the acquisition and integration process include

•   integrating operations services and personnel in a timely and efficient manner 

•   diverting significant management attention and financial resources from our other operations and disrupting our ongoing business

•   unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities and integration costs 

•   incurring liabilities from the acquired businesses for infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims for which we may not be successful in seeking indemnification

•   incurring debt amortization expenses related to intangible assets large and immediate writeoffs assuming unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities or issuing common stock that would dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership

•   generating sufficient revenues and net income to offset acquisition costs 

•   potential loss of or harm to employee or client relationships 

•   properly structuring our acquisition consideration and any related postacquisition earnouts and successfully monitoring any earnout calculations and payments

•   failing to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits andor the strategic benefits of the acquisition 

•   retaining key senior management and key sales and marketing and research and development personnel particularly those of the acquired operations

•   potential incompatibility of solutions services and technology or corporate cultures 

•   consolidating and rationalizing corporate information technology and administrative infrastructures 

•   integrating and documenting processes and controls 

•   entry into unfamiliar markets and 

•   increased complexity from potentially operating additional geographically dispersed sites particularly if we acquire a company or business with facilities or operations outside of the countries in which we currently have operations

in addition the primary value of many potential acquisition targets in the it services industry lies in their skilled it professionals and established client relationships transitioning these types of assets to our business can be particularly difficult due to different corporate cultures and values geographic distance and other intangible factors for example some newly acquired employees may decide not to work with us or to leave shortly after their move to our company and some acquired clients may decide to discontinue their commercial relationships with us these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and make it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our clients

hostilities and acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our clients we may be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against any such occurrences such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for it services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified it professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled it professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility

the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including

•   investors’ perception of and demand for securities of it services companies 

•   conditions of the united states and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds 

•   our future results of operations and financial condition 

•   government regulation of foreign investment in the cis and cee and 

•   economic political and other conditions in the cis and cee 

existing stockholders have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control

as of march 1 2014 to our knowledge our greater than 5 stockholders directors and executive officers and entities affiliated with them own approximately 463 of the outstanding shares of our common stock which includes approximately 167 of the outstanding shares of our common stock owned by affiliates of siguler guff  company as a result these stockholders if acting together would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors the approval of merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other significant business or corporate transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock

companies doing business in emerging markets such as cis and cee countries are subject to significant economic risks

cis and cee countries are generally considered to be emerging markets investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant economic risks the economies of cis and cee countries like other emerging economies are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world the economies of belarus russia ukraine hungary and other cis and cee countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns as has happened in the past financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies such as in the cis and cee could dampen foreign investment in these markets and materially adversely affect their economies in addition deterioration in macroeconomic conditions such as the recent debt crisis in europe could require us to reassess the value of goodwill for potential impairment this goodwill is subject to impairment tests on an ongoing basis weakening macroeconomic conditions in the countries in which we operate andor a significant difference between the performance of an acquired company and the business case assumed at the time of acquisition could require us to write down the value of the goodwill or a portion of such value these risks may be compounded by incomplete unreliable or unavailable economic and statistical data on cis and cee countries including elements of the information provided in this annual report similar statistics may be obtainable from other nonofficial sources although the underlying assumptions and methodology and consequently the resulting data may vary from source to source economic instability in cis or cee countries where we operate and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

we have significant international operations and we earn our revenues and incur our expenses in multiple currencies doing business in different foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks including risks related to revenues and receivables compensation of our personnel purchases and capital expenditures the majority of our revenues are in us dollars british pounds russian rubles and euros and the majority of our expenses particularly salaries of it professionals are denominated in us dollars but payable in belarusian rubles or in other local currencies at the exchange rate in effect at the time to the extent that we increase our business and revenues which are denominated in belarusian rubles ukrainian hryvnia hungarian forints or other local currencies we will also increase our receivables denominated in those currencies and therefore also increase our exposure to fluctuations in their exchange rates against the us dollar our reporting currency similarly any capital expenditures such as for computer equipment which are payable in the local currency of the countries in which we operate but are imported to such countries and any deposits we hold in local currencies can be materially affected by depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar and the effect of such depreciation on the local economy due to the increasing size of our international operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk”

the banking and financial systems in the cis remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition

banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore in russia belarus and other cis countries bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition

the legal systems in cis countries can create an uncertain environment for business activity which could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis

the legal framework to support a market economy remains new and in flux in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and as a result these legal systems can be characterized by

•   inconsistencies between and among laws and governmental ministerial and local regulations orders decisions resolutions and other acts

•   gaps in the regulatory structure resulting from the delay in adoption or absence of implementing regulations 

•   selective enforcement of laws or regulations sometimes in ways that have been perceived as being motivated by political or financial considerations

•   limited judicial and administrative guidance on interpreting legislation 

•   relatively limited experience of judges and courts in interpreting recent commercial legislation 

•   a perceived lack of judicial and prosecutorial independence from political social and commercial forces 

•   inadequate court system resources 

•   a high degree of discretion on the part of the judiciary and governmental authorities and 

•   underdeveloped bankruptcy procedures that are subject to abuse 

in addition as is true of civil law systems generally judicial precedents generally have no binding effect on subsequent decisions not all legislation and court decisions in cis countries are readily available to the public or organized in a manner that facilitates understanding enforcement of court orders can in practice be very difficult all of these factors make judicial decisions difficult to predict and effective redress uncertain additionally court claims and governmental prosecutions may be used in furtherance of what some perceive to be political aims

the untested nature of much of recent legislation in the countries in which we operate and the rapid evolution of their legal systems may result in ambiguities inconsistencies and anomalies in the application and interpretation of laws and regulations any of these factors may affect our ability to enforce our rights under our contracts or to defend ourselves against claims by others or result in our being subject to unpredictable requirements and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

these uncertainties also extend to property rights for example during the transformation of russia belarus ukraine and other cis countries from centrally planned economies to market economies legislation has generally been enacted in each of these countries to protect private property against uncompensated expropriation and nationalization however there is a risk that due to the lack of experience in enforcing these provisions and due to political factors these protections would not be enforced in the event of an attempted expropriation or nationalization expropriation or nationalization of any of our entities their assets or portions thereof potentially without adequate compensation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

our cis subsidiaries can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements

we operate in cis countries primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of other cis countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations

for example in russian corporate law if the net assets of a russian joint stock company calculated on the basis of russian accounting standards are lower than its charter capital as at the end of its third or any subsequent financial year the company must either decrease its charter capital or liquidate if the company fails to comply with these requirements governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation of any damages

similarly there have also been cases in cis countries in which formal deficiencies in the establishment process of a legal entity or noncompliance with provisions of law have been used by courts as a basis for liquidation of a legal entity weaknesses in the legal systems of cis countries create an uncertain legal environment which makes the decisions of a court or a governmental authority difficult if not impossible to predict if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

any us or other foreign judgments that may be obtained against us may be difficult to enforce in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries

although we are a delaware corporation subject to suit in the united states and other courts many of our assets are located in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and one of our directors and his assets are located outside the united states although arbitration awards are generally enforceable in cis countries judgments obtained in the united states or in other foreign courts including those with respect to us federal securities law claims may not be enforceable in many cis countries including belarus russia and ukraine there is no mutual recognition treaty between the united states and belarus russia or ukraine therefore it may be difficult to enforce any us or other foreign court judgment obtained against any of our operating subsidiaries in cis countries

our stock price is volatile

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by our competitors and us projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expense and affect our operations

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act sec regulations and new york stock exchange or nyse rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours these new or changed laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and corporate governance practices as a result our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice our reputation may be harmed

executive summary

we are a leading global it services provider focused on complex software product development services software engineering and verticallyoriented custom development solutions since our inception in 1993 we have been serving independent software vendors or isvs and technology companies the foundation we have built serving isvs and technology companies has enabled us to differentiate ourselves in the market for software engineering skills and technology capabilities our work with these clients exposes us to their customers’ challenges across a variety of industry “verticals” this has enabled us to develop verticalspecific domain expertise and grow our business in multiple industry verticals including banking and financial services business information and media and travel and consumer

we have client management locations in the united states canada the united kingdom germany sweden russia switzerland netherlands kazakhstan singapore hong kong and australia our clients primarily consist of forbes global 2000 corporations located in north america europe and the commonwealth of independent states the “cis” our delivery centers in belarus ukraine russia hungary kazakhstan and poland are strategically located in centers of software engineering talent and educational excellence across the cee and cis the majority of our employees are located in these delivery centers with compensation and benefits related to this pool of resources being the primary component of our operating expenses additionally our global delivery model and centralized support functions combined with the benefits of scale from the shared use of fixedcost resources such as computers and office space enhance our productivity levels and enable us to better manage efficiency of our global operations by maintaining adequate resource utilization levels and implementing companywide costmanagement programs as a result we have managed to create a relatively homogeneous delivery base whereby our applications tools methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions from our delivery centers to global clients across all geographies thereby further strengthening our relationships with them

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 939 and 784 of our revenues in 2013 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively

overview of 2013

during the year ended december 31 2013 total revenues grew by approximately 280 compared to 2012 powered by growth in north america and europe our performance remained strong in banking and financial services and isvs and technology verticals which increased 397 and 263 respectively over the corresponding period in 2012

during 2013 we also managed to reverse a negative growth trend in the business information and media vertical caused by declining revenues from one of our major customers thomson reuters revenues from our business information and media vertical increased 213 in 2013 as compared to 2012 and excluding the impact of declining revenues from thomson reuters our business information and media vertical revenues increased 556 in 2013 as compared to 2012

fiscal 2013 was also the year that showcased success of our strategic acquisitions of thoughtcorp inc “thoughtcorp” and empathy lab llc “empathy lab” which we completed in 2012 both acquisitions proved to be a natural fit into all of our core verticals and strengthened our value proposition in the north american market over a short period we have managed to realize a number of expected synergies including acquisition of a major customer within travel and consumer vertical which has been on epam’s “top ten” list since the second quarter of 2013

we remain committed to maintaining and improving a wellbalanced portfolio of clients and seek to grow revenues from our clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements as well as by growing our key client base through both internal business development efforts and strategic acquisitions during 2013 revenues from our top five and top ten customers accounted for 306 and 423 respectively which represents a decrease in customer concentration for the latter of approximately 21 as compared to 2012

change in presentation of certain financial information

as part of our discussion and analysis we analyze revenues by vertical the composition and organization of our verticals is fluid and the structure changes regularly in response to overall growth new business acquisitions and changes in reporting structure prior to the third quarter of 2012 certain individually insignificant customers pertaining to acquired operations were aggregated for the purposes of presenting revenue by vertical effective third quarter of 2012 we have individually reassigned these customers to corresponding verticals we believe this change is preferable as it allows us to more effectively analyze our verticals by aligning presentation of existing and acquired customers using a standardized approach these changes do not result in any adjustments to our previously issued financial statements and were applied retrospectively beginning on january 1 2010 in addition we have revised our disclosures to present travel and hospitality and retail and consumer verticals as a single travel and consumer vertical changes for the year ended december 31 2011 are presented in the table below

 summary of results of operations and nongaap financial measures

the following tables present a summary of our results of operations by amount and as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

 for 2013 we reported results of operations consistent with the continued execution of our strategy in 2013 our operating expenses increased in line with increase in revenues we continue to invest in our people processes and infrastructure to support our goal to deliver highquality offerings that meet the needs of our customers differentiate our value proposition from that of our competition and drive scale and growth across all geographies and verticals

key highlights of our consolidated results in 2013 as compared to 2012 were as follows

 

 

 

 

 

the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period

in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls we discuss the following key measures that are not calculated according to the generally accepted accounting principles “gaap”

 

 

we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally manage our business and evaluate our performance we also believe these measures help investors compare our operating performance with our results in prior periods and compare our operating results with those of similar companies we exclude certain expenses and benefits from nongaap income from operations that we believe are not reflective of these underlying business trends and are not useful measures in determining our operational performance and overall business strategy because our reported nongaap financial measures are not calculated according to gaap these measures are not comparable to gaap and may not be comparable to similarly described nongaap measures reported by other companies within our industry consequently our nongaap financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation from or supplant comparable gaap measures but rather should be considered together with our consolidated and condensed financial statements which are prepared according to gaap the following table presents a reconciliation of income from operations as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

 

from time to time we acquire businesses and incur operating expenses which we would not otherwise have incurred such expenses include acquisitionrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets these costs are dependent on a number of factors and are generally inconsistent in amount and frequency as well as significantly impacted by the timing and size of related acquisitions additionally the size complexity and volume of past acquisitions which often drives the magnitude of acquisitionrelated costs may not be indicative of the size complexity and volume of future transactions amortization of purchased intangible assets is excluded from our nongaap measures to allow management to evaluate our operating results as if these assets have been developed internally rather than acquired in a business combination we believe this approach provides a supplemental measure of performance in which the acquired intangible assets are treated in a manner comparable to the internally developed assets

stockbased compensation expense is excluded from our nongaap measures because we believe such exclusion allows for a more accurate comparison of our operating results among the periods as well as enhances comparability with operating results of peer companies

we also exclude certain other expenses and onetime charges because we believe they are not indicative of what we consider to be organic continuing operations such items include goodwill impairment writeoffs legal settlement expenses and certain other noncash onetime charges

see our “results of operations” section below for a more detailed discussion and analysis of these charges

we have significant international operations and we earn revenues and incur expenses in multiple currencies when important to management’s analysis operating results are compared in “constant currency terms” a nongaap financial measure that excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the effect of rate fluctuations is excluded by translating the current period’s revenues and expenses into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” of this report for a discussion of our exposure to exchange rates

effects of inflation

economies in cis countries such as belarus russia and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation in particular over a threeyear period ended december 31 2013 significant inflation has been reported in belarus the national statistical committee of belarus estimated that inflation was approximately 1183 in 2013 1097 in 2012 and 1532 in 2011 in 2013 2012 and 2011 we had 03 05 and 08 of our revenues respectively denominated in belarusian rubles

the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments including increasing interest rates and the use of antimonopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize local currency inflation government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed materially to economic uncertainty in belarus belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future the russian and ukrainian governments have historically implemented similar measures as belarus to fight inflation

periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and as a result may reduce our profitability inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counterinflationary measures that may harm our financial condition results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities

results of operations

the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated this information should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period

 

 revenues

revenues are derived primarily from providing software development services to our clients we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by service offering vertical client location contract type and client concentration revenues consist of it services revenues and reimbursable expenses and other revenues which primarily include travel and entertainment costs that are chargeable to clients

revenues by service offering

software development includes software product development custom application development services and enterprise application platforms services and has historically represented and we expect to continue to represent the substantial majority of our business the following table sets forth revenues by service offering by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated

 revenues by vertical

the foundation we have built with isvs and technology companies has enabled us to leverage our strong domain knowledge and industryspecific knowledge capabilities to become a premier it services provider to a range of additional verticals such as banking and financial services business information and media and travel and consumer additionally we have substantial expertise in other industries such as oil and gas telecommunications healthcare and several others which are currently reported in aggregate under other verticals the following table sets forth revenues by vertical by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated

 revenues by client location

our revenues are sourced from three geographic markets north america europe and the cis we present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed as such revenues by client location differ from the segment information in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which is not solely based on the geographic location of the clients but rather is based on managerial responsibility for a particular client regardless of client location the following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated

 revenues by contract type

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice arrangements our engagement models depend on the type of services provided to a client the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve historically the majority of our revenues have been generated under timeandmaterial contracts under timeandmaterial contracts we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly daily or monthly rates fixedprice contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on preagreed intervals we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future

the following table sets forth revenues by contract type by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated

 revenues by client concentration

we have grown our revenues from our clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements and we have grown our key client base through internal business development efforts and several strategic acquisitions

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 939 and 784 of our revenues in 2013 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively in addition we have significantly grown the size of existing accounts the number of clients that accounted for over 50 million in annual revenues increased to 22 in 2013 from 10 in 2010 and the number of clients that generated at least 05 million in revenues increased to 147 in 2013 from 72 in 2010

the following table sets forth revenues contributed by our top five and top ten clients by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated

 one customer thomson reuters accounted for over 10 of our revenues in 2011 there were no customers with revenues in excess of 10 in either 2013 or 2012 the volume of work we perform for specific clients is likely to vary from year to year as we are typically not any client’s exclusive external it services provider and a major client in one year may not contribute the same amount or percentage of our revenues in any subsequent year

operating expenses

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries employee benefits and stock compensation expense travel costs and subcontractor fees salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are allocated to cost of revenues regardless of whether they are actually performing services during a given period

in addition cost of revenues is dependent on utilization levels some of our it professionals are specially trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services 

selling general and administrative expenses

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and include such items as senior management administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries stock compensation expense and related fringe benefits legal and audit expenses commissions insurance operating lease expenses travel costs and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues collected in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hitech park

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues

provision for income taxes

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2013 2012 and 2011 we had 698 million 566 million and 499 million respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory us tax rate additionally we have secured special tax benefits in belarus and hungary as described below as a result our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes due to the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18 the “on hightechnologies park” decree which created the belarus hitech park is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1 2006

our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10 of annual qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 to 2012 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 however will be allowed through 2014 we anticipate full utilization up to the 70 limit until 2014 with full phase out in 2015

our domestic income before provision for income taxes differs from the north america segment income before provision for income taxes because segment operating profit is a management reporting measure which does not take into account most corporate expenses as well as the majority of nonoperating costs and stock compensation expenses we do not hold our segment managers accountable for these expenses as they cannot influence these costs within the scope of their operating authority nor do we believe it is practical to allocate these costs to specific segments as they are not directly attributable to any specific segment all our segments are treated consistently with respect to such expenses when determining segment operating profit

results by business segment

our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other the segments represent components of epam for which separate financial information is available that is used on a regular basis by our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some specific cases however managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team   in a case like this the client’s activity would be reported through the reportable segment our chief operating decision maker evaluates the company’s performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit

segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs generally operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to similar factors pressures and challenges expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as an allocation of certain shared services expenses we use globally integrated support organizations to realize economies of scale and efficient use of resources as a result a majority of our expenses is shared by all segments these shared expenses include delivery recruitment and development sales and marketing and support functions such as it finance legal and human resources generally shared expenses are allocated based on measurable drivers of expense eg recorded hours or headcount however certain expenses are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment further stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as “unallocated” and adjusted only against our total income from operations

revenues from external clients and segment operating profit before unallocated expenses for the north america europe russia and other reportable segments were as follows for the years ended december 31

 2013 compared to 2012

north america segment

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from the north america segment were 513 and 455 of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 874 million or 443 in 2013 over the 2012 results the north america segments operating profits increased by 281 million or 728 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 668 million net profit from the segment’s operations

the increase in revenues during year ended december 31 2013 was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing client relationships as well as by revenues contributed by new clients including through the acquisitions of thoughtcorp and empathy lab completed in 2012 within the segment revenue from our isvs and technology vertical increased 290 million or 323 in 2013 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 representing 332 of the overall segment growth our travel and consumer vertical was the fastest growing vertical in 2013 with revenues increasing by 265 million or 946 in 2013 as compared to the corresponding period in 2012 the increase in the segment’s operating profit in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily driven by increased revenues and improved profitability partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits of our it professionals primarily as a result of added headcount to support our revenue growth and continued demand for onsite resources

europe segment

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from europe segment were 368 and 389 of total segment revenues respectively representing an increase of 352 million or 209 in 2013 over the 2012 results during 2013 the europe segment’s operating profits increased by 18 million or 56 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 346 million net profit from the segment’s operations

europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio given our nearshore delivery capabilities and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services is continuing to gain considerable traction with europeanbased clients within the segment growth was the strongest in our banking and financial services vertical with 2013 revenues increasing by approximately 369 million or 520 over the corresponding period of 2012 the decrease in the segment’s operating profit as a percentage of the european segment’s revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense relative to recognized service revenues in 2013 as compared to 2012

russia segment

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 revenues from our russia segment were 100 and 117 of total segment revenues respectively in 2013 revenues from the russia segment were 558 million representing an increase of 52 million or 103 over the 2012 results during 2013 our russia segments operating profits decreased by 20 million or 218 as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 71 million net profit from the segment’s operations

within the segment 2013 revenues from the banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals increased 24 million and 28 million respectively accounting for most of the segments growth in the period indicated the decrease in operating profits of the russia segment in 2013 when compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to revenue recognition delays related to fixedprice projects revenue recognition on such projects is susceptible to timing delays as a result there may be instances where we record the cost related to the performance of services with no associated revenue recognized in the period that services were rendered in particular we estimate a total of 25 million of revenues remained unrecognized as of december 31 2013 in the russia segment with related costs reflected in the segments operating results for the year then ended similarly we may record revenue in a period where the underlying expenses have been recorded in a previous period which would significantly improve the operating margin of the russia segment in the period of recognition consequently a higher concentration of fixedprice projects in the russia segment affects the periodoverperiod comparability of the segment’s operating results

other segment

during the year ended december 31 2013 revenues from the other segment were 105 million or 19 of total segment revenues representing a decrease of 65 million or 382 from the 2012 results during 2013 our other segments operating profits decreased by 61 million as compared to the corresponding period of 2012 to 08 million

the decrease in revenues and operating profits of the other segment in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily attributable to a completion of a large fixedpriced project in 2012 with 46 million revenues and 25 million operating profit recognized in 2012 that did not recur in 2013 in addition the fourth quarter of 2012 benefited significantly from fixedpriced project with one of our largest customers in that segment that did not recur in 2013

2012 compared to 2011

north america segment

our north america segment accounted for 455 of total segment revenues in both 2012 and 2011 north america revenues increased by 456 million or 300 from 1517 million in 2011 to 1973 million in 2012 the increase in revenues was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing client relationships as well as revenues contributed by new clients additionally two acquisitions completed in 2012 contributed approximately 77 million or 167 to the overall segment growth during the period within the segment revenue from our isvs and technology and travel and consumer verticals increased by approximately 228 million and 108 million respectively as compared to 2011 representing 737 of the overall segment growth

segment operating profit increased by 49 million or 146 from 337 million in 2011 to 387 million in 2012 the increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting primarily from additional headcount to support our revenue growth and continued demand for onsite resources

europe segment

our europe segment accounted for 389 and 369 of total segment revenues in 2012 and 2011 respectively europe continues to be a rapidly growing segment in our portfolio given our nearshore delivery capabilities and our value proposition in delivering quality software engineering solutions and services is continuing to gain considerable traction with europeanbased clients as a result revenue increased 454 million or 368 from 1235 million during 2011 to 1689 million in 2012 within the segment growth was the strongest in our banking and financial services and travel and consumer verticals where revenue increased by approximately 302 million and 112 million respectively in 2012 as compared to 2011

segment operating profit increased by 77 million or 305 from 251 million during 2011 to 328 million during 2012 the increase in europe segment operating profit was mainly attributable to increased revenues partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs primarily driven by additional headcount to support our revenue growth and continued demand for increase in onsite resources

russia segment

segment operating profit decreased by 14 million or 134 from 104 million in 2011 to 90 million in 2012 the decrease in russia’s operating profit was attributable to a combination of factors including higher compensation and benefits of our it professionals in 2012 as compared to 2011 subcontractor costs incurred in connection with initial implementation work on a longterm project with one of russia’s leading consumerelectronic retail chains and reduced utilization levels resulting from fluctuations in service volumes

other segment

revenues from other segment comprised 39 of total segment revenues compared to 38 in 2011 with the majority of revenues derived from clients located in kazakhstan and ukraine other segment revenues increased by 41 million or 322 from 129 million in 2011 to 170 million in 2012 the growth was primarily attributable to the successful completion and delivery of a large world bank sponsored fixed fee project in ukraine with 38 million of incremental revenues recognized in 2012

segment operating profit increased by 46 million or 1891 from 24 million in 2011 to 70 million in 2012 the increase in segment operating profit was primarily attributable to the same project noted above

liquidity and capital resources

capital resources

at december 31 2013 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 1692 million and 400 million of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of that date 1435 million of our total cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states including 725 million held in us dollar denominated accounts in belarus including deposits that accrued interest at an average interest rate of 43 during 2013

we have a revolving line of credit with pnc bank national association the “bank” effective january 15 2013 we entered into a new agreement with the bank the “2013 credit facility” which increased our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit from 300 million to 400 million and extended maturity of the new facility to january 15 2015 advances under the new line of credit accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the london interbank offer rate or libor plus 125 the 2013 credit facility is secured by all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets as well as by 100 of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries the line of credit also contains customary financial and reporting covenants and limitations we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our revolving line of credit and believe that our revolving line of credit provides sufficient flexibility such that we will remain in compliance with its terms in the foreseeable future at december 31 2013 we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit

the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds we are not however restricted in repatriating those funds back to the united states if necessary if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends 1432 million would be subject to foreign withholding taxes of which 1252 million would also be subject to us corporate income tax we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flows increase our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside the us and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing

to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions

we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved at the time revenues are recognized we provide for any contractual deductions and reduce revenues accordingly we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms

we derive our revenues from a variety of service offerings which represent specific competencies of our it professionals contracts for these services have different terms and conditions based on the scope deliverables and complexity of the engagement which require management to make judgments and estimates in determining appropriate revenue recognition pattern fees for these contracts may be in the form of timeandmaterials or fixedprice arrangements

the majority of our revenues 823 of revenues in 2013 841 in 2012 and 861 in 2011 is generated under timeandmaterial contracts whereby revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client

revenues from fixedprice contracts 157 of revenues in 2013 137 in 2012 and 110 in 2011 are determined using the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the client revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue is recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client in order to estimate the amount of revenue for the period under the proportional performance method we determine the percentage of actual labor hours incurred as compared to estimated total labor hours and apply that percentage to the consideration allocated to the deliverable the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements a number of internal and external factors can affect such estimates including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known no significant revisions occurred in each of the three years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of 12 months or less

from time to time we enter into multiple element arrangements with our customers in the vast majority of cases such multipleelement arrangements represent fixedpriced arrangements to develop a customized it solution to meet the customer’s needs combined with warranty support over a specified period of time in the future to which we refer to as the “warranty period” our customers retain full intellectual property ip rights to the results of our services and the software element created in lieu of such services is no more than incidental to any of the service deliverables as defined in accordance with asc 9856051513 for such arrangements we follow the guidance set forth in asc 60525 revenue recognition – multiple element arrangements as to whether multiple deliverables exist how the arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated we recognize revenue related to the delivered products only if all revenue recognition criteria are met and the delivered element has a standalone value to the customer and allocate total consideration among the deliverables based on their relative selling prices revenue related to the software development services is recognized under the proportional performance method as described above while warranty support services are recognized on a straightline basis over the warranty period the warranty period is generally three months to two years

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income

goodwill and other intangible assets

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal assets we typically acquire are customer relationships trade names noncompetition agreements and workforce as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment events or circumstances that might require impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 all of our intangible assets had finite lives and we did not incur any impairment losses in respect of our intangible assets during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 or 2011

effective in the fourth quarter of 2013 we changed the annual goodwill impairment assessment date for all of our reporting units from december 31 st to october 31 st  which represented a voluntary change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date we are also required to assess the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment between annual assessment dates when events or circumstances dictate this change does not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge and is preferable as additional resources for the preparation review and conclusion of the annual goodwill impairment test are available at this time further this timing more closely aligns with our annual budgeting and planning process information prepared during the annual budgeting and planning process is used extensively in our impairment assessment we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level and we had three reporting units that were subject to the annual impairment testing in 2013 our annual impairment review as of october 31 2013 and december 31 2012 did not result in an impairment charge for any of these reporting units it was impracticable to apply this change retrospectively as we are unable to objectively determine significant estimates and assumptions that would have been used in those earlier periods without the use of hindsight

for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values in order to determine if impairment is indicated if so the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to its carrying amount and the impairment loss is measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value the fair values are estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings multiples based on market data these valuations are considered level 3 measurements under fasb asc topic 820 we utilize estimates to determine the fair value of the reporting units such as future cash flows growth rates capital requirements effective tax rates and projected margins among other factors estimates utilized in the future evaluations of goodwill for impairment could differ from estimates used in the current period calculations

when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment of amortizable intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of the asset’s carrying value using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that utilize a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model over the remaining asset life the estimates of future cash flows attributable to intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value

income taxes

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the audited consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized

the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be

 

realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings

changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” was signed into law on january 2 2013 because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment certain provisions of the act benefiting our 2012 us federal taxes including the subpart f controlled foreign corporation lookthrough exception were not recognized in our 2012 financial results and instead were reflected in our 2013 financial results

accounting for stockbased employee compensation plans

stockbased compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and nonemployee directors is determined based on the grantdate fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest we recognize these compensation costs on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the option vesting term of four years

we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from those estimates such revisions could have a material effect on our operating results the assumptions used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly stockbased compensation for future awards may differ materially compared to the awards previously granted

fair value of employee housing loans

we issue loans to our employees under the employee housing program “housing loans” housing loans are issued in us dollars with a 5year term and carry an interest rate of 75 the program was designed to be a retention mechanism for our employees in belarus

although permitted by authoritative guidance we did not elect a fair value option for these financial instruments these housing loans are measured at fair value upon initial recognition and subsequently carried at amortized cost less allowance for loan losses any difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a loan upon initial recognition “dayone” recognition is charged to expense

the housing loans were classified as level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using significant unobservable inputs the estimated fair value of these housing loans upon initial recognition was computed by projecting the future contractual cash flows to be received from the loans and discounting those projected net cash flows to a present value which is the estimated fair value the “income approach” in applying the income approach we analyzed similar loans offered by thirdparty financial institutions in belarusian rubles “byr” and adjusted the interest rates charged on such loans to exclude the effects of underlying economic factors such as inflation and currency devaluation we also assessed the probability of future defaults and associated cash flows impact in addition we separately analyzed the rate of return that market participants in belarus would require when investing in unsecured usddenominated government bonds with similar maturities a “riskfree rate” and evaluated a risk premium component to compensate the market participants for the credit and liquidity risks inherent in the loans’ cash flows as described in the following paragraph as a result of the analysis performed we determined the carrying values of the housing loans issued during the year ended december 31 2013 approximated their fair values upon initial recognition we also estimated the fair values of the housing loans that were outstanding as of december 31 2013 using the inputs noted above and determined their fair values approximated the carrying values as of that date

repayment of housing loans is primarily dependent on personal income of borrowers obtained through employment with epam which income is set in us dollars and is not closely correlated with common macroeconomic risks existing in belarus such as inflation local currency devaluation and decrease in the purchasing power of the borrowers’ income given a large demand for the program among our employees and its advantages as compared to alternative methods of financing available on the market we expect the borrowers to fulfill their obligations and we estimate the probability of voluntary termination of employment among the borrowers as de minimis additionally housing loans are capped at 50 thousand per loan and secured by real estate financed through the program we establish a maximum loantovalue ratio of 70 and expect a decrease in the ratio over the life of a housing loan due to ongoing payments by employees

recent accounting pronouncements

see note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv “item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules — audited consolidated financial statements” regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our audited consolidated financial statements




 item 7 a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and concentration of credit risks in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions

concentration of credit and other risk

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of employee loans cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues

at december 31 2013 loans issued to employees were 64 million or 15 of our total assets these loans expose us to a risk of nonpayment and loss repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on personal income of borrowers obtained through their employment with epam and may be adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic situations such as higher unemployment levels currency devaluation and inflation additionally continuing financial stability of a borrower may be adversely affected by job loss divorce illness or personal bankruptcy we also face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses if any and costs of foreclosure decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from either the borrower andor guarantors

we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties as of december 31 2013 1031 million of total cash was held in cis countries with 739 million of that in belarus banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore bank deposits made by corporate entities in cis are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition

trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across our clients in proportion to their revenues as of december 31 2013 unbilled revenues from two customers individually exceeded 10 of total unbilled revenues and jointly accounted for 333 of total unbilled revenues as of that date and one customer accounted for over 10 of total accounts receivable as of that date

during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 our top five customers accounted for 306 and 310 of our total revenues and our top ten customers accounted for 423 and 444 of our total revenues respectively no customer accounted for over 10 of total revenues in 2013 or 2012

credit losses and writeoffs of trade accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our audited consolidated financial statements

interest rate risk

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit bearing interest at libor plus 125 rate we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility

we also do not believe that employee loans issued by us under the employee housing program expose us to significant interest rate risks these loans are designed to be a retention mechanism for our employees in belarus and are financed with available funds of our belarusian subsidiary

we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates however our future interest expense may increase and interest income may fall due to changes in market interest rates

foreign exchange risk

our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in canada europe and the cis and cee regions and generate a significant portion of our revenues in certain nonus dollar currencies principally euros british pounds and russian rubles we incur expenditures in nonus dollar currencies principally in hungarian forints euros and russian rubles associated with our delivery centers located in cee we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in these foreign currencies and cash flows for expenditures in foreign currencies we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange volatility our results of operations can be affected if the euro the british pound hungarian forint andor russian ruble appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues and expenses based on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 a 10 appreciation  depreciation of either the euro or the british pound against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase  decrease of approximately 03 million in net income and a 10 appreciation  depreciation of the hungarian forint against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase  decrease of approximately 04 million in net income based on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 a 10 appreciation depreciation of all applicable foreign currencies against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase decrease of approximately 01 million in net income

to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations the analysis quantifies the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period most commonly within a oneyear period the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible during the forecast period fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices changes in the currency exchange rates resulted in our reporting a net transactional foreign currency exchange losses of 25 million and 18 million during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively these losses are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

additionally foreign currency translation adjustments from translating financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from functional currency to the us dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity or included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income if local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries differ from their functional currencies as of december 31 2013 approximately 216 of our total net assets were subject to foreign currency translation exposure as compared to 211 as of december 31 2012 and 296 of our net income in 2013 was generated by subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not us dollars as compared to 323 in 2012 during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we recorded translation losses of 03 million within our consolidated income in both periods and 08 million of translation losses and 25 million of translation gains within our consolidated accumulated other comprehensive income during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively

sales and marketing

we also maintain a dedicated sales force as well as a marketing team which coordinates corporatelevel branding efforts that range from sponsorship of programming competitions to participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events 

clients 

our clients primarily consist of forbes global 2000 corporations during 2011 and 2010 one of our largest clients thomson reuters accounted for over 10 of our revenues however in 2012 thomson reuters accounted for 60 of our revenues and no other client accounted for over 10 of revenues in that period 

the following table sets forth the percentage of our revenues for the periods presented by client location 

 

 revenues by client location above differs from the segment information our operations consist of four reportable segments north america europe russia and other this determination is based on the unique business practices and market specifics of each region and that each region engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses our reportable segments are based on managerial responsibility for a particular client because managerial responsibility for a particular client relationship generally correlates with the client’s geographic location there is a high degree of similarity between client locations and the geographic boundaries of our reportable segments in some specific cases however managerial responsibility for a particular client is assigned to a management team in another region usually based on the strength of the relationship between client executives and particular members of our senior management team in a case like this the client’s activity would be reported through the reportable segment information about our segments is presented below 

 

 the following table sets forth the percentage of our revenues by client vertical for the periods presented 

 

 the following table shows the distribution of our clients by revenues for the periods presented 

  

 the following table sets forth our revenues by service offering by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods presented 

 

 we typically enter into a master services agreement with our clients which provides a framework for services that is then supplemented by statements of work which specify the particulars of each individual engagement including the services to be performed pricing terms and performance criteria 

for example we have entered into a master services agreement with thomson reuters under this master services agreement we may not use subcontractors to perform the services without thomson reuters’ prior written consent our personnel must comply with thomson reuters’ security policies the intellectual property rights to deliverables we make in the course of or enabling the performance of the services we provide to thomson reuters are owned by thomson reuters deliverables and services are subject to acceptance testing and liquidated damages are prescribed for late delivery service credits are prescribed for servicelevel failures and charges are subject to adjustment for deficiencies in services that are not measured by service levels the master services agreement provides stepin rights benchmarking monitoring rights and audit rights the master services agreement is not a commitment to purchase our services and may be terminated for various reasons including a timelimited right of termination upon a changeofcontrol event or without cause upon six months’ notice 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global it services providers as well as those based in cee we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings reputation and track record for highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to clients’ business needs scale financial stability and price 

we face competition primarily from 

 

  

  

  

  

 we are a leading global it services provider of complex software product development and software engineering services in cee we believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions our technical employee base and the development and continuous improvement in process methodologies applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future however we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china and from it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more stable than some cis and cee countries our present and potential competitors may also have substantially greater financial marketing or technical 

  

resources may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands may be able to devote greater resources towards the development promotion and sale of their services than we can and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients 

human capital 

our people are critical to the success of our business attracting and retaining employees is a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and meet our clients’ needs we had 10043 8125 and 6168 employees as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively of these employees approximately 93 were located in the cis and cee 2 were located in western europe excluding hungary and 5 were located in north america as of december 31 2012 we believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any labor disputes our employees have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements 

recruitment and retention 

we believe our company culture and reputation as a leading global it services provider of complex software product development and software engineering services in cee enhances our ability to recruit and retain highly soughtafter employees we have dedicated fulltime employees that oversee all aspects of our human capital management process through our proprietary internal tools we effectively plan our shortterm and longterm recruitment needs and deploy the necessary personnel and processes to optimize utilization and to quickly satisfy the demands of our clients 

we have developed our base of it professionals by hiring highlyqualified experienced it professionals from this region and by recruiting students from leading universities in cee we have strong relationships with the leading institutions in cee such as the belarusian state university belarusian state university of informatics and radioelectronics the saint petersburg state university of information technologies mechanics and optics the moscow state university the moscow institute of physics  technology the moscow state university of instrument engineering and computer sciences and the national technical university of ukraine and we have established epam delivery centers near many of these campuses the quality and academic prestige of the cee educational system is renowned worldwide for instance in the 2012 acm international collegiate programming contest icpc five out of 10 top ranked finishers were from cee and two belarus universities made it in the top 12 our ongoing involvement with these universities includes supporting epambranded research labs developing training courses providing teaching equipment actively supporting curriculum development and engaging students to identify their talents and interests our relationships with these technical institutions provide us access to a highlyqualified talent pool of programmers and allow us to consistently attract highlyskilled students from these institutions we also conduct lateral hiring through a dedicated it professional talent acquisition team whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced it professionals within the region 

to attract retain and motivate our it professionals we seek to provide an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance in addition we offer a challenging work environment ongoing skills development initiatives and attractive career advancement and promotion opportunities 

training and development 

we dedicate significant resources to the training and development of our it professionals we believe in the importance of supporting educational initiatives and we sponsor employees’ participation in internal and external training and certifications furthermore we actively pursue partner engagements with technical institutions in cee 

we provide training continuing education and career development programs for both entrylevel and experienced it professionals entrylevel it professionals undergo a rigorous training program that consists of approximately three to six months of classroom training as well as numerous hours of handson training through actual engagements this comprehensive program results in employees who are highly proficient and possess deep technical expertise that enables them to immediately serve our clients’ needs for our midlevel and senior it professionals we offer continuing education programs aimed at helping them advance in their careers we also provide mentoring opportunities management and soft skills training intensive workshops and management and technical advancement programs we are committed to systematically identifying and nurturing the development of middle and senior management through formal leadership training evaluation development and promotion 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights are important to our business we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees independent contractors vendors and clients to enter into written confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us these agreements generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential 

we customarily enter into nondisclosure agreements with our clients with respect to the use of their software systems and platforms our clients usually own the intellectual property in the software or systems we develop for them furthermore we usually 

  

grant a perpetual worldwide royaltyfree nonexclusive transferable and nonrevocable license to our clients to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them 

protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our clients

regulations 

due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations and several belarusian russian ukrainian hungarian kazakhstan and us federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business see “item 1a risk factors — risks relating to our business — our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations or unfavorable interpretation by authorities of these regulations could harm our business” and “item 1a risk factors — risks relating to our business — we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate concerning our operations including export restrictions us economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations”

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks relating to our business 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources 

we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business over the past several years our revenues grew from 1606 million in 2008 to 4338 million in 2012 we have also supplemented our organic growth with strategic acquisitions as of december 31 2012 we had 8495 it professionals as compared to 2890 it professionals as of december 31 2007 we intend to continue our expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 

our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure continued expansion increases the challenges we face in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these problems associated with expansion our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

moreover we intend to continue our expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological and operational risks and challenges with which we are unfamiliar and we may not be able to mitigate these risks and challenges to successfully grow those services or markets we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth which could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled it professionals we may not have the necessary resources to properly staff projects and failure to successfully compete for such it professionals could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to our clients 

our success depends largely on the contributions of our it professionals and our ability to attract and retain qualified it professionals competition for it professionals in the markets in which we operate can be intense and accordingly we may not be able to retain or hire all of the it professionals necessary to meet our ongoing and future business needs any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire it professionals to meet our business requirements 

the total attrition rates among our it professionals who have worked for us for at least six months were 107 91 and 94 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we may encounter higher attrition rates in the future a significant increase in the attrition rate among it professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services the competition for highlyskilled it professionals may require us to increase salaries and we may be unable to pass on these increased costs to our clients 

  

in addition our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain skilled it professionals including experienced management it professionals which enables us to keep pace with growing demands for outsourcing evolving industry standards and changing client preferences if we are unable to attract and retain the highlyskilled it professionals we need we may have to forgo projects for lack of resources or be unable to staff projects optimally our failure to attract train and retain it professionals with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new it professionals successfully could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to our clients 

increases in wages and other compensation expense for our it professionals could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage 

wage costs for it professionals in cis and cee countries are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the cis and cee it services industry may increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our it professionals as well as the prices we can charge for our services increases in wage costs may reduce our profitability 

additionally we have granted certain options under our stock incentive plans and entered into certain other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past as a result of which we have recorded 68 million 29 million and 29 million as stockbased compensation expenses for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” prescribes how we account for stockbased compensation which could adversely or negatively impact our results of operations or the price of our common stock gaap requires us to recognize stockbased compensation as compensation expense in the statement of operations generally based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of the grant with compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the number of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations the issuance of equitybased compensation to our it professionals would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees we currently do not maintain key man life insurance for any of the senior members of our management team or other key personnel if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted 

if any of our senior executives or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients suppliers knowhow and key it professionals and staff members to them also if any of our business development managers who generally keep a close relationship with our clients joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients and our revenues may be materially adversely affected additionally there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge practices or procedures by such personnel if any dispute arises between our senior executives or key personnel and us any noncompetition nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key personnel might not provide effective protection to us especially in cis and cee countries where some of our senior executives and most of our key employees reside in light of uncertainties with legal systems in cis and cee countries 

emerging markets such as the cis and cee countries are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks 

we have significant operations in cis and cee countries which are generally considered to be emerging markets cee includes albania belarus bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland republic of macedonia romania russia serbia and montenegro slovakia slovenia the former yugoslav republic of macedonia turkey and ukraine the cis is comprised of constituents of the former ussr including armenia azerbaijan belarus georgia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan moldova russia tajikistan turkmenistan ukraine and uzbekistan investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world and are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including complying with foreign laws and regulations and the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions tax increases fluctuations in exchange rates inflation and unstable political situations and labor issues investors should also note that emerging economies such as the economies of belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan and 

  

hungary are subject to rapid change and that the information set forth in this annual report may become outdated relatively quickly accordingly investors should exercise particular care in evaluating the risks involved and must decide for themselves whether in light of those risks an investment in our common stock is appropriate 

we generate a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of clients and any loss of business from these clients could materially reduce our revenues 

our ability to maintain close relationships with our major clients is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for a specific client is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our clients’ exclusive it services provider and we do not have longterm commitments from any clients to purchase our services a major client in one year may not provide the same level of revenues for us in any subsequent year the it services we provide to our clients and the revenues and net income from those services may decline or vary as the type and quantity of it services we provide change over time furthermore our reliance on any individual client for a significant portion of our revenues may give that client a certain degree of pricing leverage against us when negotiating contracts and terms of service 

in addition a number of factors other than our performance could cause the loss of or reduction in business or revenues from a client and these factors are not predictable for example a client may decide to reduce spending on technology services or sourcing from us due to a challenging economic environment or other factors both internal and external relating to its business these factors among others may include corporate restructuring pricing pressure changes to its outsourcing strategy switching to another it services provider or returning work inhouse 

the loss of any of our major clients or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations 

our revenues operating results and profitability may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult to make accurate financial forecasts 

our revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future which could make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts factors that are likely to cause these variations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to make accurate financial forecasts it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we do not have longterm commitments from our clients and our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts 

our clients are generally not obligated for any longterm commitments to us although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from repeated business which we define as revenues from a client who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature in addition our clients can terminate many of our master services agreements and work orders with or without cause and in most cases without any cancellation charge therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated as well as maintain relationships with existing clients and secure new clients to expand our business 

there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including 

 

  

  

  

  

 failure to perform or observe any contractual obligations could result in cancellation or nonrenewal of a contract which could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and an increase in our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount the ability of our clients to terminate agreements makes our future revenues uncertain we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us which could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations 

in addition some of our agreements specify that if a change of control of our company occurs during the term of the agreement the client has the right to terminate the agreement if any future event triggers any changeofcontrol provision in our client contracts these master services agreements may be terminated which would result in loss of revenues 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states or europe could reduce our revenues and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

the recent crisis in the financial and credit markets in north america europe and asia led to a global economic slowdown with the economies of those regions showing significant signs of weakness the it services industry is particularly sensitive to the economic environment and tends to decline during general economic downturns we derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients in north america and europe if the north american or european economies further weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our clients may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization levels and productivity levels 

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization levels of fixedcost resources including human resources as well as other resources such as computers and office space and our ability to increase our productivity levels we have expanded our operations significantly in recent years through organic growth and strategic acquisitions which has resulted in a significant increase in our headcount and fixed overhead costs 

some of our it professionals are specially trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any client or on any project for which we have dedicated it professionals or facilities we may not be able to efficiently reallocate these it professionals and facilities to other clients and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer 

  

we face intense competition from onshore and offshore it services companies and increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

the market for it services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are reputation and track record industry expertise breadth and depth of service offerings quality of the services offered language marketing and selling skills scalability of infrastructure ability to address clients’ timing requirements and price 

we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations clients tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other competing it services providers clients may prefer it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some cis and cee countries 

our ability to compete successfully also depends in part on a number of factors beyond our control including the ability of our competitors to recruit train develop and retain highlyskilled it professionals the price at which our competitors offer comparable services and our competitors’ responsiveness to client needs some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources our current and potential competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands may be able to devote greater resources towards the development promotion and sale of their services than we can and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients client buying patterns can change if clients become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our clients while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our delivery centers such as in minsk belarus we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our clients are concentrated in four specific industry verticals isvs and technology banking and financial services business information and media and travel and consumer clients in isvs and technology accounted for 246 252 and 293 of our revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively clients in banking and financial services accounted for 258 229 and 194 of our revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these five industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource it services 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example a worsening of economic conditions in the financial services industry and significant consolidation in that industry may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services in these industries and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes for example consolidation in any of these industries or acquisitions particularly involving our clients may decrease the potential number of buyers of our services our clients may experience rapid changes in their prospects substantial price competition and pressure on their profitability this in turn may result in increasing pressure on us from clients in these key industries to lower our prices which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

to successfully market our service offerings and obtain larger and more complex projects we need to establish close relationships with our clients and develop a thorough understanding of their operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our management personnel and it professionals some of whom do not have experience managing largescale or complex projects in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements a failure by us to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business impact our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose clients and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards characterize the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in it services enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing client needs the process of developing our client solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep up with technology methodology and business changes is subject to a number of risks including that 

 

  

  

  

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our clients could cause us to lose clients and materially adversely affect our business 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our it services which requires significant investment of human resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients’ decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other it services providers or inhouse resources and the timing of our clients’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and hinder our revenue growth for certain clients we may begin work and incur costs prior to concluding the contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 

  

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our clients may experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology thereby further delaying the implementation process our current and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could materially adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to recognize revenues in the period in which our services are performed which may cause our margins to fluctuate 

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice contract arrangements all revenues are recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards we recognize revenues when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 

additionally we recognize revenues from fixedprice contracts based on the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the system or solution is specified by the client revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client our failure to meet all the acceptance criteria or otherwise meet a client’s expectations may result in our having to record the cost related to the performance of services in the period that services were rendered but delay the timing of revenue recognition to a future period in which all acceptance criteria have been met 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform sometimes include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable 

in addition a number of our contracts contain pricing terms that condition a portion of the payment of fees by the client on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules set forth in the contracts our failure to meet such performance goals service levels or completion schedules or our failure to meet client expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profitability and operating results are dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services our rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profitability could suffer 

  

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients weak macroeconomic conditions and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected moreover in the event of delays in payment from our governmental and quasigovernmental clients we may have difficulty collecting on receivables owed in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to generate and retain business depends on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties 

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business including operations marketing sales and delivery functions us transfer pricing regulations as well as regulations applicable in cis and cee countries in which we operate require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be on arm’slength terms we consider the transactions among our subsidiaries to be on arm’slength terms the determination of our consolidated provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions 

if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including as a result of a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business 

our earnings could be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in the cis and cee or such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we do not accrue incremental us taxes on all cis and cee earnings as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2013 these increased taxes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus hungary and russia to companies in our industry 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are exempt or levied at a reduced rate on a variety of taxes including a 100 exemption from belarusian income tax which as of the date of this annual report was 18 and an exemption from the value added tax for a period of 15 consecutive years effective july 1 2006 in addition our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10 of qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 to 2012 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 however will be allowed through 2014 we anticipate full utilization up to the 70 limit until 2014 with full phase out in 2015 our subsidiary in russia benefits from a substantially reduced rate on social contributions and an exemption on value added tax in certain circumstances which is a benefit to qualified it companies in russia if the tax holiday relating to our belarusian subsidiary the tax incentives relating to our hungarian subsidiary or the lower tax rates and social contributions relating to our russian subsidiary are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — certain income statement line items — provision for income taxes” 

our agreement with one of our largest clients gives it the option to assume the operations of one of our offshore development centers and the exercise of that option could result in a loss of future revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

during the fouryear term of our agreement with one of our largest clients which ends in december 2014 unless extended by the client the client is entitled to request us to transfer to it or its designees all of the operating relationships including employment relationships with the employees dedicated to the offshore development center and contracts with subcontractors at a predetermined transfer price dependent on the experience level of the transferred employee and the duration such employee worked on projects for the client we are required to transfer assets that have already been financed by the client under our agreement such as our offshore development center dedicated to the client at a de minimis preagreed price since our client has already financed such assets the carrying value of such assets is de minimis in addition to the above amounts the client is also required to pay a negotiated value or book value for the assets to be transferred that have not already been financed by the client this client accounted for 92 63 and 29 of our revenues in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition under our agreement the client has the right to step in and take over all or part of the offshore development center in certain instances including if we are in material default under certain provisions of our agreement such as those related to the level or quality of our services or the client has determined it is otherwise obliged to do so in emergencies or for regulatory reasons in the event the client takes over any services we provide under our agreement it will not be obligated to pay us for the provision of those services if the client exercises these rights we would lose future revenues related to the services we provide to the client as well as lose some of our assets and key employees and our losses may not be fully covered by the contractual payment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our services or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current clients and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of client data a failure to attract new clients or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot assure you that despite testing by us and our clients errors will not be found in new software product development solutions which could result in litigation and other claims for damages against us and thus could materially adversely affect our business 

disruptions in internet infrastructure telecommunications or significant failure in our it systems could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenue 

part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications financial control accounting customer service and other data processing systems between our clients’ offices our delivery centers and our client management locations including our headquarters in newtown pa our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these internet it or communication systems which could be caused by among other things software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrading damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online or increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenue or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

  

our computer networks may be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt our services and cause us to incur losses or liabilities that could adversely affect our business 

our computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses worms malicious applications and other security problems caused by unauthorized access to or improper use of systems by third parties or employees a hacker who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information including personally identifiable information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations although we intend to continue to implement security measures computer attacks or disruptions may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems actual or perceived concerns that our systems may be vulnerable to such attacks or disruptions may deter our clients from using our solutions or services as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 

data networks are also vulnerable to attacks unauthorized access and disruptions for example in a number of public networks hackers have bypassed firewalls and misappropriated confidential information including personally identifiable information it is possible that despite existing safeguards an employee could misappropriate our clients’ proprietary information or data exposing us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability losses or liabilities that are incurred as a result of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business 

if we cause disruptions to our clients’ businesses or provide inadequate service our clients may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose clients have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

if our it professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our clients or fail to consistently meet service requirements of a client these errors or failures could disrupt the client’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us in addition a failure or inability to meet a contractual requirement could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 

the services we provide are often critical to our clients’ businesses certain of our client contracts require us to comply with security obligations including maintaining network security and backup data ensuring our network is virusfree maintaining business continuity planning procedures and verifying the integrity of employees that work with our clients by conducting background checks any failure in a client’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us any significant failure of our equipment or systems or any major disruption to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications in the locations in which we operate could impede our ability to provide services to our clients have a negative impact on our reputation cause us to lose clients and adversely affect our results of operations 

under our contracts with our clients our liability for breach of our obligations is in some cases limited pursuant to the terms of the contract such limitations may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages in addition certain liabilities such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients are generally not limited under our contracts the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us in amounts greater than those covered by our current insurance policies could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations even if such assertions against us are unsuccessful we may incur reputational harm and substantial legal fees 

our subcontracting practices may expose us to technical uncertainties potential liabilities and reputational harm 

in order to meet our personnel needs increase workforce flexibility and improve pricing competitiveness we use subcontractors and freelancers primarily to perform shortterm assignments in certain specialty areas or on other projects where it is impractical to use our employees or where we need to supplement our resources we also use subcontractors for internal assignments such as assisting in development of internal systems recruiting training human resources consulting and administration and other similar support functions despite certain advantages of subcontracting such arrangements also give rise to a number of risks 

although we try to source competent and credible third parties as our subcontractors they may not be able to deliver the level of service that our clients expect us to deliver furthermore we enter into confidentiality agreements with our subcontractors but we cannot guarantee that they will not breach the confidentiality of us or our clients and misappropriate our or our clients’ proprietary information and technology in the course of providing service we as the party to the contract with the client are directly responsible for the losses our subcontractors cause our clients under the subcontracting agreements we enter into our subcontractors generally promise to indemnify us for damages caused by their breach but we may be unable to collect under these agreements moreover their breaches may damage our reputation cause us to lose existing business and adversely affect our ability to acquire new business in the future 

  

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our it professionals or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

some of our it professionals are retained as independent contractors although we believe that we have properly classified these individuals as independent contractors there is nevertheless a risk that the irs or another federal state provincial or foreign authority will take a different view furthermore the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities if a federal state provincial or foreign authority or court enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs under such laws and regulations including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there is also a risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged noncompliance with federal state provincial or foreign tax laws further if it were determined that any of our independent contractors should be treated as employees we could possibly incur additional liabilities under our applicable employee benefit plans 

in addition we have classified all of our us employees as “exempt” under the federal labor standards act or the flsa if it were determined that any of our us employees should be classified as “nonexempt” under the flsa we may incur costs and liabilities for back wages unpaid overtime fines or penalties andor be subject to employee litigation 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses 

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources 

most of the agreements we have entered into with our clients require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in cis and cee countries although to date no client has brought any claims against us for such failure our clients have the right to terminate these agreements as a result of such failure 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to defend and hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliates harmless with respect to claims related to matters including our breach of certain representations warranties or covenants or out of our intellectual property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct and certain other claims payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement and any claims under these agreements may not be subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements so they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by a violation of intellectual property rights the disclosure of other confidential information including personally identifiable information system failures errors or unsatisfactory performance of services and our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover these damages 

we often have access to and are required to collect and store sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information some of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for breaches of confidentiality infringement indemnity and certain other matters furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws the protection of the intellectual property rights and other confidential information or personally identifiable information of our clients is particularly important for us since our operations are mainly based in cis and cee countries cis and cee countries have not traditionally enforced intellectual property protection to the same extent as countries such as the united states despite measures we take to protect the intellectual property and other confidential information or personally identifiable information of our clients unauthorized parties including our employees and subcontractors may attempt to misappropriate certain intellectual property rights that are proprietary to our clients or otherwise breach our clients’ confidences unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

many of our contracts involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients’ businesses and provide benefits to our clients that may be difficult to quantify any failure in a client’s system or any breach of security could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure furthermore any errors by our employees in the performance of services for a client or poor execution of such services could result in a client terminating our engagement and seeking damages from us 

although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in rendering our services these limitations on liability may not apply in all circumstances may be unenforceable in some cases or may be insufficient to protect us from liability for damages there may be instances when liabilities for damages are greater than the insurance coverage we hold and we will have to internalize those losses damages and liabilities not covered by our insurance 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights implementation of intellectual propertyrelated laws in cis and cee countries has historically been lacking primarily because of ambiguities in the laws and difficulties in enforcement accordingly protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in cis and cee countries may not be as effective as that in the united states or other countries 

to protect our and our clients’ proprietary information and other intellectual property we require our employees independent contractors vendors and clients to enter into written confidentiality agreements with us these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technology reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our clients’ technologies tools and applications without paying us for doing so and our clients may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register several of these trademarks we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks for instance in 2005 we entered into a consent of use and settlement agreement that allowed a third party to use the mark “epam” as capitalized in the foregoing and restricted our ability to do so for more information see “item 1 business — intellectual property” in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks 

  

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

in addition we rely on certain thirdparty software to conduct our business if we lose the licenses which permit us to use such software they may be difficult to replace and it may be costly to do so 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties we typically indemnify clients who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our clients redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our clients may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms also we may be unaware of intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies 

further our current and former employees andor subcontractors could challenge our exclusive rights in the software they have developed in the course of their employment in russia and certain other countries in which we operate an employer is deemed to own the copyright in works created by its employees during the course and within the scope of their employment but the employer may be required to satisfy additional legal requirements in order to make further use and dispose of such works while we believe that we have complied with all such requirements and have fulfilled all requirements necessary to acquire all rights in software developed by our independent contractors andor subcontractors these requirements are often ambiguously defined and enforced as a result we cannot assure that we would be successful in defending against any claim by our current or former employees independent contractors andor subcontractors challenging our exclusive rights over the use and transfer of works those employees independent contractors andor subcontractors created or requesting additional compensation for such works 

we are subject to additional risks as a result of our recent and possible future acquisitions and the hiring of new employees who may misappropriate intellectual property from their former employers the developers of the technology that we have acquired or may acquire may not have appropriately created maintained or enforced intellectual property rights in such technology indemnification and other rights under acquisition documents may be limited in term and scope and may therefore provide little or no protection from these risks parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business a successful infringement claim against us whether with or without merit could among others things require us to pay substantial damages develop noninfringing technology or rebrand our name or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and would require us to cease making licensing or using products that have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential clients deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our clients against infringement claims in certain instances any intellectual property claim or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations or unfavorable interpretation by authorities of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide it services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations particularly in the cis and cee countries in which we operate our systems and operations are located almost entirely in the cis and cee and laws and regulations that are applicable to us but not to our competitors may impede our ability to develop and offer services that compete effectively with those offered by our noncis or cee based competitors and generally available worldwide violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our 

  

business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business 

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate concerning our operations including export restrictions us economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

our operations are subject to laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international economic sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and other laws concerning our international operations the fcpa’s foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions although varying in both scope and jurisdiction we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 

we have recently developed and are in the process of implementing formal controls and procedures to ensure that we are in compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and similar sanctions laws and regulations the implementation of such procedures may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or restrictions on export activities including other us laws and regulations as well as foreign and local laws and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws if we are not in compliance with export restrictions us or international economic sanctions or other laws and regulations that apply to our operations we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted could harm our ability to compete effectively and impair our ability to service our clients 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues many organizations and public figures in the united states and europe have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing it services providers and the loss of jobs in their home countries for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies are periodically considered in congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs in the united states a number of us states have passed legislation that restricts state government entities from outsourcing certain work to offshore it services providers given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction and consideration of other restrictive legislation is possible if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain business visas in the event that any of these measures becomes law our ability to service our clients could be impaired and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in europe or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of services from an offshore location could also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example legislation enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to an it services provider or changes its current it services provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous it services provider are entitled to become employees of the new it services provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous it services provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other european union 

  

countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation could materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and european union and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and european union in a costeffective manner 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore it services providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore it services provider any slowdown or reversal of the existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the country in which our clients operate 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from clients outside north america represented 508 488 and 455 of our revenues for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we anticipate that clients outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe and the cis in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in the cis and cee as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions 

additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not impede the success of our international expansion plans or limit our ability to compete effectively in other countries 

restrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the vast majority of our employees are nationals of cis and cee countries some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our clients’ facilities which are sometimes located outside the cis and cee the ability of our employees to work in the united states europe the cis and other countries outside the cis and cee depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits historically the process for obtaining visas for nationals of cis and cee countries to certain countries including the united states and europe has been lengthy and cumbersome immigration laws in the united states and in other countries are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions particularly given the recent global economic downturn it is possible that there could be a change in the existing laws or the enactment of new legislation imposing restrictions on the deployment of work visa holders at client locations which could adversely impact our ability to do business in the jurisdictions in which we have clients however it is generally difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or maintaining business visas for our employees our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed as a result we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our clients on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies are difficult to integrate divert management resources or do not perform to our expectations we may not be able to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisitions and our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

on occasion we have expanded our service capabilities and gained new clients through selective acquisitions our ability to successfully integrate an acquired entity and realize the benefits of an acquisition requires among other things successful integration of technologies operations and personnel challenges we face in the acquisition and integration process include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the primary value of many potential acquisition targets in the it services industry lies in their skilled it professionals and established client relationships transitioning these types of assets to our business can be particularly difficult due to different corporate cultures and values geographic distance and other intangible factors for example some newly acquired employees may decide not to work with us or to leave shortly after their move to our company and some acquired clients may decide to discontinue their commercial relationships with us these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and make it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our clients 

hostilities involving the united states and acts of terrorism violence or war natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our clients we may be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against any such occurrences such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for it services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified it professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled it professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility 

  

the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including 

 

  

  

  

  

 existing stockholders have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

as of march 1 2013 to our knowledge our greater than 5 stockholders directors and executive officers and entities affiliated with them own approximately 50 of the outstanding shares of our common stock which includes approximately 40 of the outstanding shares of our common stock owned by affiliates of siguler guff  company as a result these stockholders if acting together would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors the approval of merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other significant business or corporate transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

companies doing business in emerging markets such as cis and cee countries are subject to significant economic risks 

cis and cee countries are generally considered to be emerging markets investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant economic risks the economies of cis and cee countries like other emerging economies are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world the economies of belarus russia ukraine hungary and other cis and cee countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns as has happened in the past financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies such as in the cis and cee could dampen foreign investment in these markets and materially adversely affect their economies in addition a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions such as the recent debt crisis in europe could require us to reassess the value of goodwill for potential impairment this goodwill is subject to impairment tests on an ongoing basis weakening macroeconomic conditions in the countries in which we operate andor a significant difference between the performance of an acquired company and the business case assumed at the time of acquisition could require us to write down the value of the goodwill or a portion of such value these risks may be compounded by incomplete unreliable or unavailable economic and statistical data on cis and cee countries including elements of the information provided in this annual report similar statistics may be obtainable from other nonofficial sources although the underlying assumptions and methodology and consequently the resulting data may vary from source to source economic instability in cis or cee countries where we operate and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we have significant international operations and we earn our revenues and incur our expenses in multiple currencies doing business in different foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks including risks related to revenues and receivables compensation of our personnel purchases and capital expenditures the majority of our revenues are in us dollars british pounds russian rubles and euros and the majority of our expenses particularly salaries of it professionals are denominated in us dollars but payable in belarusian rubles or in other local currencies at the exchange rate in effect at the time to the extent that we increase our business and revenues which are denominated in belarusian rubles ukrainian hryvnia hungarian forints or other local currencies we will also increase our receivables denominated in those currencies and therefore also increase our exposure to fluctuations in their exchange rates against the us dollar our reporting currency similarly any capital expenditures such as for computer equipment which are payable in the local currency of the countries in which we operate but are imported to such countries and any deposits we hold in local currencies can be materially affected by depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar and the effect of such depreciation on the local economy certain foreign currency exposures to some extent are naturally offset on a consolidated basis however due to the increasing size of our international operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our results see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

  

the banking and financial systems in the cis remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore in russia belarus and other cis countries bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the legal systems in cis countries can create an uncertain environment for business activity which could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

the legal framework to support a market economy remains new and in flux in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and as a result these legal systems can be characterized by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition as is true of civil law systems generally judicial precedents generally have no binding effect on subsequent decisions not all legislation and court decisions in cis countries are readily available to the public or organized in a manner that facilitates understanding enforcement of court orders can in practice be very difficult all of these factors make judicial decisions difficult to predict and effective redress uncertain additionally court claims and governmental prosecutions may be used in furtherance of what some perceive to be political aims 

the untested nature of much of recent legislation in the countries in which we operate and the rapid evolution of their legal systems may result in ambiguities inconsistencies and anomalies in the application and interpretation of laws and regulations any of these factors may affect our ability to enforce our rights under our contracts or to defend ourselves against claims by others or result in our being subject to unpredictable requirements and could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

these uncertainties also extend to property rights for example during the transformation of russia belarus ukraine and other cis countries from centrally planned economies to market economies legislation has generally been enacted in each of these countries to protect private property against uncompensated expropriation and nationalization however there is a risk that due to the lack of experience in enforcing these provisions and due to political factors these protections would not be enforced in the event of an attempted expropriation or nationalization expropriation or nationalization of any of our entities their assets or portions thereof potentially without adequate compensation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our cis subsidiaries can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements 

we operate in cis countries primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of other cis countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations 

for example in russian corporate law if the net assets of a russian joint stock company calculated on the basis of russian accounting standards are lower than its charter capital as at the end of its third or any subsequent financial year the company must either decrease its charter capital or liquidate if the company fails to comply with these requirements governmental or local 

  

authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation of any damages 

similarly there have also been cases in cis countries in which formal deficiencies in the establishment process of a legal entity or noncompliance with provisions of law have been used by courts as a basis for liquidation of a legal entity weaknesses in the legal systems of cis countries create an uncertain legal environment which makes the decisions of a court or a governmental authority difficult if not impossible to predict if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

any us or other foreign judgments that may be obtained against us may be difficult to enforce in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries 

although we are a delaware corporation subject to suit in the united states and other courts many of our assets are located in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and one of our directors and his assets are located outside the united states although arbitration awards are generally enforceable in cis countries judgments obtained in the united states or in other foreign courts including those with respect to us federal securities law claims may not be enforceable in many cis countries including belarus russia and ukraine there is no mutual recognition treaty between the united states and belarus russia or ukraine therefore it may be difficult to enforce any us or other foreign court judgment obtained against any of our operating subsidiaries in cis countries 

our stock price is volatile 

our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance furthermore we believe our stock price should reflect future growth and profitability expectations and if we fail to meet these expectations our stock price may significantly decline 

compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expense and affect our operations 

changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act sec regulations and new york stock exchange or nyse rules are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours these new or changed laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and corporate governance practices as a result our efforts to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice our reputation may be harmed

executive summary 

we are a leading global it services provider focused on complex software product development services software engineering and verticallyoriented custom development solutions since our inception in 1993 we have been serving independent software vendors or isvs and technology companies the foundation we have built serving isvs and technology companies has enabled us to differentiate ourselves in the market for software engineering skills and technology capabilities our work with these clients exposes us to their customers’ challenges across a variety of industry “verticals” this has enabled us to develop verticalspecific domain expertise and grow our business in multiple industry verticals including banking and financial services business information and media and travel and consumer

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 919 and 820 of our revenues in 2012 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively 

recent developments 

on february 13 2012 we completed our initial public offering of 6900000 shares of our common stock which included 900000 shares of our common stock sold by us pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters sold at a price to the public of 1200 per share of the 6900000 shares of common stock sold we issued and sold 2900000 shares of common stock and our selling stockholders sold 4000000 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds to us of 348 million and 290 million in net proceeds to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 24 million and offering expenses of 34 million we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders

we expect to continue to seek opportunities to deepen our industry expertise and technology capabilities necessary to deliver complex missioncritical solutions as part of our ongoing growth strategy 

  

change in presentation of certain financial information 

as part of our discussion and analysis we analyze revenues by vertical the composition and organization of our verticals is fluid and the structure changes regularly in response to overall growth new business acquisitions and changes in reporting structure prior to the third quarter of 2012 certain individually insignificant customers pertaining to acquired operations were aggregated for the purposes of presenting revenue by vertical effective third quarter of 2012 we have individually reassigned these customers to corresponding verticals we believe this change is preferable as it allows us to more effectively analyze our verticals by aligning presentation of existing and acquired customers using a standardized approach these changes do not result in any adjustments to our previously issued financial statements and were applied retrospectively beginning on january 1 2010 as presented in the tables below additionally we have revised our disclosures to present travel and hospitality and retail and consumer verticals as a single travel and consumer vertical 

 

  

 summary of results of operations and nongaap financial measures 

the following tables present a summary of our results of operations by amount and as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 the key drivers of our consolidated results in 2012 as compared to 2011 were as follows 

 

   

  

  

  

 the operating results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period 

in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls we discuss two key measures that are not calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the first nongaap measure is income from operations as reported on our consolidated and condensed statements of income and comprehensive income excluding certain expenses and benefits which we refer to as “nongaap income from operations” the second measure calculates nongaap income from operations as a percentage of reported revenues which we refer to as “nongaap operating margin” we believe that these nongaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business and we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally manage our business and evaluate our performance we also believe these measures help investors compare our operating performance with our results in prior periods and compare our operating results with those of similar companies we exclude certain expenses and benefits from nongaap income from operations that we believe are not reflective of these underlying business trends and are not useful measures in determining our operational performance and overall business strategy because our reported nongaap financial measures are not calculated according to gaap these measures are not comparable to gaap and may not be comparable to similarly described nongaap measures reported by other companies within our industry consequently our nongaap financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation from or supplant comparable gaap measures but rather should be considered together with our consolidated and condensed financial statements which are prepared according to gaap the following table presents a reconciliation of income from operations as reported on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

 

  

   

effects of inflation 

economies in cis countries such as belarus russia and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation in particular over a threeyear period ending december 31 2012 significant inflation has been reported in belarus the national statistical committee of belarus estimated that inflation was approximately 1097 in 2012 1532 in 2011 and 99 in 2010 in 2012 2011 and 2010 we had 05 08 and 12 of our revenues respectively denominated in belarusian rubles 

the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments including increasing interest rates and the use of antimonopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize local currency inflation government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed materially to economic uncertainty in belarus belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future the russian and ukrainian governments have historically implemented similar measures as belarus to fight inflation 

periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and as a result may reduce our profitability inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counterinflationary measures that may harm our financial condition results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities 

results of operations

our revenues are sourced from three geographic markets north america europe and the cis we present and discuss our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed as such revenues by client location differ from the segment information in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which is not solely based on the geographic location of the clients but rather is based on managerial responsibility for a particular client regardless of client location the following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

   

 revenues by contract type 

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice arrangements our engagement models depend on the type of services provided to a client the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve historically the majority of our revenues have been generated under timeandmaterial contracts under timeandmaterial contracts we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly daily or monthly rates fixedprice contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on preagreed intervals we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future 

the following table sets forth revenues by contract type by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 revenues by client concentration 

we have grown our revenues from our clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements and we have grown our key client base through internal business development efforts and several strategic acquisitions 

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 919 and 820 of our revenues in 2012 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years respectively in addition we have significantly grown the size of existing accounts the number of clients that accounted for over 50 million in annual revenues increased to 16 in 2012 from 10 in 2010 and the number of clients that generated at least 05 million in revenues increased to 114 in 2012 from 72 in 2010 

the following table sets forth revenues contributed by our top five and top ten clients by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 during 2011 and 2010 one of our largest clients thomson reuters accounted for over 10 of our revenues however there were no customers accounting for over 10 of our revenues in 2012 the volume of work we perform for specific clients is likely to vary from year to year as we are typically not any client’s exclusive external it services provider and a major client in one year may not contribute the same amount or percentage of our revenues in any subsequent year 

operating expenses 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries employee benefits and stock compensation expense travel costs and subcontractor fees salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are allocated to cost of revenues regardless of whether they are actually performing services during a given period 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and include such items as senior management administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries stock compensation expense and related fringe benefits legal and audit expenses commissions insurance operating lease expenses travel costs and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues collected in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hitech park 

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2012 2011 and 2010 we had 566 million 499 million and 303 million respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory us tax rate additionally we have secured special tax benefits in belarus and hungary as described below as a result our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes due to the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 18 the “on hightechnologies park” decree which created the belarus hitech park is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1 2006 

our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10 of annual qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 to 2012 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 however will be allowed through 2014 we anticipate full utilization up to the 70 limit until 2014 with full phase out in 2015 

our domestic income before provision for income taxes differs from the north america segment income before provision for income taxes because segment operating profit is a management reporting measure which does not take into account most corporate expenses as well as the majority of nonoperating costs and stock compensation expenses we do not hold our segment managers accountable for these expenses as they cannot influence these costs within the scope of their operating authority nor do we believe it is practical to allocate these costs to specific segments as they are not directly attributable to any specific segment all our segments are treated consistently with respect to such expenses when determining segment operating profit

revenues in the cis region increased 91 million or 162 compared to the prior year which was almost entirely attributable to incremental revenues from the completion of a longterm fixedpriced project as well as the addition of a number of new customers within our travel and consumer vertical during the fourth quarter of 2012

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future our ability to generate cash however is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements within the scope of fasb asc paragraph 46010154 guarantees topic other than as disclosed in note 17 of our consolidated financial statements in part iv “item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules — audited consolidated financial statements” nor do we have any investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt accordingly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are not subject to material offbalance sheet risks 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the audited consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenues primarily from software development services we recognize revenues when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved at the time revenues are recognized we provide for client incentive programs and reduce revenues accordingly 

we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms all such amounts are anticipated to be realized in subsequent periods 

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice contracts arrangements for revenues generated under timeandmaterial contracts revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client 

  

we recognize revenues from fixedprice contracts based on the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the client revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our audited consolidated financial statements a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of twelve months or less 

we enter into multiple element arrangements with our clients under timeandmaterial and fixedfee contracts in october 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables we adopted this standard effective january 1 2010 for all new or amended contracts and it did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations or change our units of accounting and how we allocate the arrangement consideration to various units of accounting these arrangements consist of development services and other service deliverables that qualify for separate units of accounting these other services include maintenance and support services for our timeandmaterial contracts and separately priced warranties for our fixedfee contracts these deliverables qualify for multiple units of accounting and therefore arrangement consideration is allocated among the units of accounting based on their relative selling price the relative selling price is based on the price charged for the deliverable when it is sold separately for multiple element arrangements under timeandmaterial contracts revenue is recognized as services are performed for each deliverable for arrangements under fixedfee contracts revenue is recognized upon delivery of development services under the proportional performance method and on a straightline basis over the warranty period the warranty period is generally six months to two years 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income 

accounts receivable 

accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each client historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables recoveries of losses from accounts receivable written off in prior years are presented within income from operations on our consolidated statements of income 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates these judgments can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 

we do not amortize goodwill but perform a test for impairment annually or when indications of potential impairment exist utilizing a fair value approach at the reporting unit level we determine fair value using the income approach which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units to which goodwill relates and determine the carrying value book value of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units 

we amortize other intangible assets with determinable lives over their estimated useful lives we record an impairment charge on these assets when we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition when there exists one or more indicators of impairment we measure any impairment of intangible assets based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value its fair value is determined based on projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model the estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the audited consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

  

the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is no longer more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” was signed into law on january 2 2013 because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment certain provisions of the act benefiting our 2012 us federal taxes including the subpart f controlled foreign corporation lookthrough exception cannot be recognized in our 2012 financial results the impact if any will be reflected in our 2013 financial results 

accounting for stockbased employee compensation plans 

stockbased compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and nonemployee directors is determined based on the grantdate fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest we recognize these compensation costs on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the option vesting term of four years 

we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from those estimates such revisions could have a material effect on our operating results the assumptions used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly stockbased compensation for future awards may differ materially compared to the awards previously granted 

earnings per share 

basic eps is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the same period our series a1 preferred series a2 preferred and series a3 preferred stock that had been outstanding and convertible into common stock until february 13 2012 the date of our initial public offering and our puttable common stock were considered participating securities since these securities had nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents during the contractual period and thus required the twoclass method of computing eps when calculating diluted eps the numerator is computed by adding back the undistributed earnings allocated to the participating securities in arriving at the basic eps and then reallocating such undistributed earnings among our common stock participating securities and the potential common shares that result from the assumed exercise of all dilutive options the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding had the options been issued 

no preferred stock was outstanding as of december 31 2012 as a result of our initial public offering on february 13 2012 when all convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock 

recent accounting pronouncements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and concentration of credit risks in addition our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 

  

concentration of credit and other risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues these financial instruments approximate fair value due to shortterm maturities we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties and accordingly do not require collateral 

we maintain our cash with financial institutions as of december 31 2012 762 million of total cash was held in cis countries with 506 million of that in belarus banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore bank deposits made by corporate entities in cis are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across our clients in proportion to their revenues during the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 our top five clients accounted for 444 and 446 of our total revenues respectively during 2011 and 2010 our largest client thomson reuters accounted for over 10 of our revenues however there were no customers accounting for over 10 of our revenues in 2012 accounts receivable and unbilled revenues for this client were 159 and 150 of total accounts receivable and unbilled revenues respectively as of december 31 2011 

credit losses and writeoffs of trade accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our audited consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit bearing interest at libor plus 125 rate we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility 

we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates however our future interest expense may increase and interest income may fall due to changes in market interest rates 

foreign exchange risk 

our audited consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in canada europe the cis and cee regions and generate a significant portion of our revenues in certain nonus dollar currencies principally euros british pounds and russian rubles we incur expenditures in nonus dollar currencies principally in hungarian forints euros and russian rubles associated with our delivery centers located in cee we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in these foreign currencies and cash flows for expenditures in foreign currencies we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange volatility our results of operations can be affected if the euro andor the british pound appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues and expenses based on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 a 10 appreciation  depreciation of the euro against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase  decrease of approximately 03 million in net income and 10 appreciation  depreciation of the british pound against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase  decrease of approximately 03 million in net income 

to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations the analysis quantifies the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period most commonly within a oneyear period the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 

  

changes in the currency exchange rates resulted in our reporting a net transactional foreign currency exchange loss of 18 million 40 million and 15 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively which are included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

additionally foreign currency translation adjustments from translating financials statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currency to the us dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity or included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income if local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries differ from their functional currencies during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we recorded 25 million of translation gain and 13 million and 04 million of translation losses within our consolidated accumulated other comprehensive income respectively additionally we recorded 03 million and 07 million of translation losses in 2012 and 2010 and 03 million of translation gain in 2011 within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

competition 

the markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global it services providers as well as those based in cee we believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge endtoend solution offerings reputation and track record for highquality and ontime delivery of work effective employee recruiting training and retention responsiveness to clients’ business needs scale financial stability and price 

we face competition primarily from 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we are a leading global it services provider of complex software product development and software engineering services in cee we believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions our technical employee base and the development and continuous improvement in process methodologies applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future however we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china and from it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more stable than some cis and cee countries our present and potential competitors may also have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands may be able to devote greater resources towards the development promotion and sale of their services than we can and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients 

human capital 

our people are critical to the success of our business attracting and retaining employees is a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and meet our clients’ needs we had approximately 8125 6168 and 4432 employees as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively of these employees approximately 950 were located in the cis and cee 19 were located in western europe excluding hungary and 31 were located in north america as of december 31 2011 we believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any labor disputes our employees have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements 

recruitment and retention

we have developed our base of it professionals by hiring highlyqualified experienced it professionals from this region and by recruiting students from leading technical institutions in cee we have strong relationships with the leading technical institutions in cee such as the belarusian state university saint petersburg state university of information technologies mechanics and optics moscow state university of instrument engineering and computer sciences and national technical university of ukraine and we have established epam delivery centers near many of these campuses our ongoing involvement with these technical institutions includes supporting epambranded research labs developing training courses providing teaching equipment actively supporting curriculum development and engaging students to identify their talents and interests our relationships with these technical institutions provide us access to a highlyqualified talent pool of programmers and allow us to consistently attract highlyskilled students from these institutions we also conduct lateral hiring through a dedicated it professional talent acquisition team whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced it professionals within the region 

to attract retain and motivate our it professionals we seek to provide an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance in addition we offer a challenging work environment ongoing skills development initiatives and attractive career advancement and promotion opportunities

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights are important to our business we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property we require our employees independent contractors vendors and clients to enter into written confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us these agreements generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us be kept confidential 

we customarily enter into nondisclosure agreements with our clients with respect to the use of their software systems and platforms our clients usually own the intellectual property in the software or systems we develop for them furthermore we usually grant a perpetual worldwide royaltyfree nonexclusive transferable and nonrevocable license to our clients to use our preexisting intellectual property but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them 

protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our business we have invested and will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex specialized solutions for our clients as of december 31 2011 we had registered intellectual property consisting of 13 us trademarks 4 nonus trademarks 1 russian copyright and 77 active domain names in 2005 we entered into a consent of use and settlement agreement with princeton financial services inc or pfs whereby we consented to pfs’s use of the mark “epam” in connection with the hosting of its software application but solely using a lowercase “e” and uppercase “pam” and pfs consented to all uses by us of the epam mark other than as capitalized in the foregoing ie “epam” while we consider the intellectual property embodied by certain of our solutions such as our infongen services important to our business we do not believe that any individual registered intellectual property right other than our rights in our name is material to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business financial condition and results of operations if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in particular forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties some of which cannot be predicted or quantified see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” 

risks relating to our business 

we may be unable to effectively manage our rapid growth which could place significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources 

we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our business recently our revenues grew from 1606 million in 2008 to 3345 million in 2011 we have also supplemented our organic growth with strategic acquisitions as of december 31 2011 we had 6968 it professionals as compared to 2890 it professionals as of december 31 2007 we intend to continue our expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 

our rapid growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative operational and financial infrastructure continued expansion increases the challenges we face in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

moreover as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological and operational risks and challenges with which we are unfamiliar and it may require substantial management efforts and skills to mitigate these risks and challenges as a result of any of these problems associated with expansion our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may not be able to achieve anticipated growth which could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 

we intend to continue our expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities as we introduce new services or enter into new markets we may face new market technological and operational risks and challenges with which we are unfamiliar and we may not be able to mitigate these risks and challenges to successfully grow those services or markets we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth which could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 

if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled it professionals we may not have the necessary resources to properly staff projects and failure to successfully compete for such it professionals could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to our clients 

our success depends largely on the contributions of our it professionals and our ability to attract and retain qualified it professionals competition for it professionals in the markets in which we operate can be intense and accordingly we may not be able to retain or hire all of the it professionals necessary to meet our ongoing and future business needs any reductions in headcount for economic or business reasons however temporary could negatively affect our reputation as an employer and our ability to hire it professionals to meet our business requirements 

the total attrition rates among our it professionals who have worked for us for at least six months were 91 94 and 112 for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we may encounter higher attrition rates in the future a significant increase in the attrition rate among it professionals with specialized skills could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity and could lead to a decline in demand for our services the competition for highlyskilled it professionals may require us to increase salaries and we may be unable to pass on these increased costs to our clients 

in addition our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend in large part on our ability to attract train and retain skilled it professionals including experienced management it professionals which enables us to keep pace with growing demands for outsourcing evolving industry standards and changing client preferences if we are unable to attract and retain the highlyskilled it professionals we need we may have to forgo projects for lack of resources or be unable to staff projects optimally our failure to attract train and retain it professionals with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new it professionals successfully could materially adversely affect our ability to provide high quality services to our clients 

increases in wages and other compensation expense for our it professionals could prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage 

wage costs for it professionals in cis and cee countries are lower than comparable wage costs in more developed countries however wage costs in the cis and cee it services industry may increase at a faster rate than in the past which ultimately may make us less competitive unless we are able to increase the efficiency and productivity of our it professionals as well as the prices we can charge for our services increases in wage costs may reduce our profitability in addition the issuance of equitybased compensation to our it professionals would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders 

  

our success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 

our future success heavily depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key employees we currently do not maintain key man life insurance for any of the senior members of our management team or other key personnel if one or more of our senior executives or key employees are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions it could disrupt our business operations and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all in addition competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future in which case our business may be severely disrupted 

if any of our senior executives or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients suppliers knowhow and key it professionals and staff members to them also if any of our business development managers who generally keep a close relationship with our clients joins a competitor or forms a competing company we may lose clients and our revenues may be materially adversely affected additionally there could be unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge practices or procedures by such personnel if any dispute arises between our senior executives or key personnel and us any noncompetition nonsolicitation and nondisclosure agreements we have with our senior executives or key personnel might not provide effective protection to us especially in cis and cee countries where some of our senior executives and most of our key employees reside in light of uncertainties with legal systems in cis and cee countries 

emerging markets such as the cis and cee countries are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant legal economic tax and political risks 

we have significant operations in cis countries including belarus russia ukraine and kazakhstan and in hungary which is a cee country investors in emerging markets such as cis and cee countries should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risk than more developed markets including in some cases significant legal economic tax and political risks investors should also note that emerging economies such as the economies of belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan and hungary are subject to rapid change and that the information set forth in this annual report may become outdated relatively quickly accordingly investors should exercise particular care in evaluating the risks involved and must decide for themselves whether in light of those risks an investment in our common stock is appropriate see “— risks related to conducting business in the cis and cee countries” 

we generate a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of clients and any loss of business from these clients could materially reduce our revenues 

we have derived and believe that in the foreseeable future we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of clients during 2011 2010 and 2009 our largest client thomson reuters accounted for over 10 of our revenues in the aggregate our top ten clients accounted for 446 426 and 353 of our revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

our ability to maintain close relationships with these and other major clients is essential to the growth and profitability of our business however the volume of work performed for a specific client is likely to vary from year to year especially since we generally are not our clients’ exclusive it services provider and we do not have longterm commitments from any clients to purchase our services a major client in one year may not provide the same level of revenues for us in any subsequent year the it services we provide to our clients and the revenues and net income from those services may decline or vary as the type and quantity of it services we provide change over time furthermore our reliance on any individual client for a significant portion of our revenues may give that client a certain degree of pricing leverage against us when negotiating contracts and terms of service 

  

in addition a number of factors other than our performance could cause the loss of or reduction in business or revenues from a client and these factors are not predictable for example a client may decide to reduce spending on technology services or sourcing from us due to a challenging economic environment or other factors both internal and external relating to its business these factors among others may include corporate restructuring pricing pressure changes to its outsourcing strategy switching to another it services provider or returning work inhouse 

the loss of any of our major clients or a significant decrease in the volume of work they outsource to us or the price at which we sell our services to them could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations 

our revenues operating results and profitability may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult to make accurate financial forecasts 

our revenues operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future which could make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts factors that are likely to cause these variations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to make accurate financial forecasts it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we do not have longterm commitments from our clients and our clients may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts 

our clients are generally not obligated for any longterm commitments to us although a substantial majority of our revenues are generated from repeated business which we define as revenues from a client who also contributed to our revenues during the prior year our engagements with our clients are typically for projects that are singular in nature in addition our clients can terminate many of our master services agreements and work orders with or without cause and in most cases without any cancellation charge therefore we must seek to obtain new engagements when our current engagements are successfully completed or are terminated as well as maintain relationships with existing clients and secure new clients to expand our business 

there are a number of factors relating to our clients that are outside of our control which might lead them to terminate a contract or project with us including 

 

  

  

  

  

 failure to perform or observe any contractual obligations could result in cancellation or nonrenewal of a contract which could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees and an increase in our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount the ability of our clients to terminate agreements makes our future revenues uncertain we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us which could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations 

in addition some of our agreements specify that if a change of control of our company occurs during the term of the agreement the client has the right to terminate the agreement if any future event triggers any changeofcontrol provision in our client contracts these master services agreements may be terminated which would result in loss of revenues 

our revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and europe worsening economic conditions or factors that negatively affect the economic health of the united states or europe could reduce our revenues and thus adversely affect our results of operations 

the recent crisis in the financial and credit markets in north america europe and asia led to a global economic slowdown with the economies of those regions showing significant signs of weakness the it services industry is particularly sensitive to the economic environment and tends to decline during general economic downturns we derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients in north america and europe if the north american or european economies further weaken or slow pricing for our services may be depressed and our clients may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly which may in turn lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

the current financial crisis in europe including concerns that certain european countries may default in payments due on their national debt and the resulting economic uncertainty could adversely impact our operating results unless and until economic conditions in europe improve and the prospects of national debt defaults in europe decline to the extent that these adverse economic conditions continue or worsen they will likely continue to have a number of negative effects on our business 

  

if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions affecting the markets in which we operate we may be unable to effectively plan for or respond to those changes and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our resource utilization levels and productivity levels 

our profitability is significantly impacted by our utilization levels of fixedcost resources including human resources as well as other resources such as computers and office space and our ability to increase our productivity levels we have expanded our operations significantly in recent years through organic growth and strategic acquisitions which has resulted in a significant increase in our headcount and fixed overhead costs 

some of our it professionals are specially trained to work for specific clients or on specific projects and some of our offshore development centers are dedicated to specific clients or specific projects our ability to manage our utilization levels depends significantly on our ability to hire and train highperforming it professionals and to staff projects appropriately and on the general economy and its effect on our clients and their business decisions regarding the use of our services if we experience a slowdown or stoppage of work for any client or on any project for which we have dedicated it professionals or facilities we may not be able to efficiently reallocate these it professionals and facilities to other clients and projects to keep their utilization and productivity levels high if we are not able to maintain optimal resource utilization levels without corresponding cost reductions or price increases our profitability will suffer 

we face intense competition from onshore and offshore it services companies and increased competition our inability to compete successfully against competitors pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

the market for it services is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are reputation and track record industry expertise breadth and depth of service offerings quality of the services offered language marketing and selling skills scalability of infrastructure ability to address clients’ timing requirements and price 

we face competition from offshore it services providers in other outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china as well as competition from large global consulting and outsourcing firms and inhouse it departments of large corporations clients tend to engage multiple it services providers instead of using an exclusive it services provider which could reduce our revenues to the extent that clients obtain services from other competing it services providers clients may prefer it services providers that have more locations or that are based in countries more costcompetitive or more stable than some cis and cee countries 

our ability to compete successfully also depends in part on a number of factors beyond our control including the ability of our competitors to recruit train develop and retain highlyskilled it professionals the price at which our competitors offer comparable services and our competitors’ responsiveness to client needs some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial marketing or technical resources our current and potential competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in client demands may be able to devote greater resources towards the development promotion and sale of their services than we can and may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our clients client buying patterns can change if clients become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our clients while competing against such competitors increased competition our inability to compete successfully pricing pressures or loss of market share could materially adversely affect our business 

  

we are investing substantial cash in new facilities and physical infrastructure and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately 

we have made and continue to make significant contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our delivery centers such as in minsk belarus we may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities these expansions will likely increase our fixed costs and if we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately our profitability may be reduced 

our revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

a substantial portion of our clients are concentrated in five specific industry verticals isvs and technology banking and financial services business information and media travel and hospitality and retail and consumer clients in isvs and technology accounted for 262 310 and 385 of our revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively clients in banking and financial services accounted for 228 193 and 114 of our revenues in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our business growth largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients in these five industry verticals and other industries that we may target in the future as well as on trends in these industries to outsource it services 

a downturn in any of our targeted industries a slowdown or reversal of the trend to outsource it services in any of these industries or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from outsourcing could result in a decrease in the demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example a worsening of economic conditions in the financial services industry and significant consolidation in that industry may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability 

other developments in the industries in which we operate may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services in these industries and we may not be able to successfully anticipate and prepare for any such changes for example consolidation in any of these industries or acquisitions particularly involving our clients may decrease the potential number of buyers of our services our clients may experience rapid changes in their prospects substantial price competition and pressure on their profitability this in turn may result in increasing pressure on us from clients in these key industries to lower our prices which could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we are not successful in managing increasingly large and complex projects we may not achieve our financial goals and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

to successfully market our service offerings and obtain larger and more complex projects we need to establish close relationships with our clients and develop a thorough understanding of their operations in addition we may face a number of challenges managing larger and more complex projects including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to successfully manage large and complex projects depends significantly on the skills of our management personnel and it professionals some of whom do not have experience managing largescale or 

  

complex projects in addition large and complex projects may involve multiple engagements or stages and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages or may cancel or delay additional planned engagements such cancellations or delays may make it difficult to plan our project resource requirements if we fail to successfully obtain engagements for large and complex projects we may not achieve our revenue growth and other financial goals even if we are successful in obtaining such engagements a failure by us to effectively manage these large and complex projects could damage our reputation cause us to lose business impact our margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards we may lose clients and our business could be materially adversely affected 

rapidly changing technologies methodologies and evolving industry standards characterize the market for our services our future success will depend in part upon our ability to anticipate developments in it services enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing client needs the process of developing our client solutions is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms operating systems technologies and methodologies our ability to keep up with technology methodology and business changes is subject to a number of risks including that 

 

  

  

  

 we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely manner or if we do respond the services technologies or methodologies we develop or implement may not be successful in the marketplace further services technologies or methodologies that are developed by our competitors may render our services noncompetitive or obsolete our failure to enhance our existing services and to develop and introduce new services to promptly address the needs of our clients could cause us to lose clients and materially adversely affect our business 

we face risks associated with having a long selling and implementation cycle for our services that require us to make significant resource commitments prior to realizing revenues for those services 

we have a long selling cycle for our it services which requires significant investment of human resources and time by both our clients and us before committing to use our services potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them on the value of our services and our ability to meet their requirements therefore our selling cycle is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control including our clients’ decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other it services providers or inhouse resources and the timing of our clients’ budget cycles and approval processes if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large projects it would negatively affect the timing of our revenues and hinder our revenues growth for certain clients we may begin work and incur costs prior to concluding the contract a delay in our ability to obtain a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement or to complete certain contract requirements in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 

implementing our services also involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us our clients may experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays 

  

associated with technology thereby further delaying the implementation process our current and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources any significant failure to generate revenues or delays in recognizing revenues after incurring costs related to our sales or services process could materially adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to recognize revenues in the period in which our services are performed which may cause our margins to fluctuate 

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice contract arrangements all revenues are recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards we recognize revenues when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 

additionally we recognize revenues from fixedprice contracts based on the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the system or solution is specified by the client revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client our failure to meet all the acceptance criteria or otherwise meet a client’s expectations may result in our having to record the cost related to the performance of services in the period that services were rendered but delay the timing of revenue recognition to a future period in which all acceptance criteria have been met 

if our pricing structures are based on inaccurate expectations and assumptions regarding the cost and complexity of performing our work then our contracts could be unprofitable 

we negotiate pricing terms with our clients utilizing a range of pricing structures and conditions our pricing is highly dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate if we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects our contracts could prove unprofitable for us we face a number of risks when pricing our contracts as many of our projects entail the coordination of operations and personnel in multiple locations with different skill sets and competencies our pricing and cost estimates for the work that we perform sometimes include anticipated longterm cost savings from transformational and other initiatives that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract there is a risk that we will underprice our projects particularly with fixedprice contracts fail to accurately estimate the costs of performing the work or fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts in particular any increased or unexpected costs delays or failures to achieve anticipated cost savings or unexpected risks we encounter in connection with the performance of this work including those caused by factors outside our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable 

in addition a number of our contracts contain pricing terms that condition a portion of the payment of fees by the client on our ability to meet defined performance goals service levels and completion schedules set forth in the contracts our failure to meet such performance goals service levels or completion schedules or our failure to meet client expectations in such contracts may result in less profitable or unprofitable engagements 

our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing rates 

our profitability and operating results are dependent on the rates we are able to charge for our services our rates are affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 if we are not able to maintain favorable pricing for our services our profitability could suffer 

if we are unable to collect our receivables from or bill our unbilled services to our clients our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed we usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles we maintain allowances against receivables actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate and as a result we might need to adjust our allowances there is no guarantee that we will accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients weak macroeconomic conditions and related turmoil in the global financial system could also result in financial difficulties including limited access to the credit markets insolvency or bankruptcy for our clients and as a result could cause clients to delay payments to us request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance or default on their payment obligations to us timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements we might experience delays in collection of andor be unable to collect our client balances and if this occurs our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected moreover in the event of delays in payment from our governmental and quasigovernmental clients we may have difficulty collecting on receivables owed in addition if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services our cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our ability to generate and retain business depends on our reputation in the marketplace 

our services are marketed to clients and prospective clients based on a number of factors since many of our specific client engagements involve unique services and solutions our corporate reputation is a significant factor in our clients’ evaluation of whether to engage our services we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees however our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by current or former clients competitors vendors adversaries in legal proceedings government regulators as well as members of the investment community and the media there is a risk that negative information about our company even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding could adversely affect our business in particular damage to our reputation could be difficult and timeconsuming to repair could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements resulting in a loss of business and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the epam brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us 

we have incurred and may continue to incur significant stockbased compensation expenses which could adversely impact our net income 

we have granted certain options under our stock incentive plans and entered into certain other stockbased compensation arrangements in the past as a result of which we have recorded 29 million 29 million and 24 million as stockbased compensation expenses for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” prescribes how we account for stockbased compensation which could adversely or negatively impact our results of operations or the price of our common stock gaap requires us to recognize stockbased compensation as compensation expense in the statement of operations generally based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of the grant with compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award the expenses associated with stockbased compensation may reduce the attractiveness of issuing equity awards under our equity incentive plan however if we do not grant equity awards or if we reduce the number of equity awards we grant we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we grant more equity awards to attract and retain key personnel the expenses associated with such additional equity awards could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors 

we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected by several factors including changes in the amount of income taxed by or allocated to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws regulations and interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits or examinations and any related interest or penalties 

we report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate we have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business including operations marketing sales and delivery functions us transfer pricing regulations as well as regulations applicable in cis and cee countries in which we operate require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be on arm’slength terms we consider the transactions among our subsidiaries to be on arm’slength terms the determination of our consolidated provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain our determination of tax liability is always subject to review or examination by authorities in various jurisdictions 

if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and proposes an adjustment including as a result of a determination that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate such an adjustment could have a negative impact on our business the us internal revenue service has recently concluded an examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax year ended december 31 2008 with no changes and the state of new jersey division of taxation has begun an examination of our state returns for tax years ended december 31 2007 through 2011 the results from these and other tax examinations and audits may differ from the liabilities recorded in our audited consolidated financial statements and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our earnings could be adversely affected if we change our intent not to repatriate earnings in the cis and cee or such earnings become subject to us tax on a current basis 

we do not accrue incremental us taxes on all cis and cee earnings as these earnings as well as other foreign earnings for all periods are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states while we have no plans to do so events may occur in the future that could effectively force us to change our intent not to repatriate our foreign earnings if we change our intent and repatriate such earnings we will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than our effective income tax rate in 2011 these increased taxes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus hungary and russia to companies in our industry 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are exempt or levied at a reduced rate on a variety of taxes including a 100 exemption from belarusian income tax which as of the date of this annual report was 24 and an exemption from the value added tax for a period of 15 consecutive years effective july 1 2006 in addition our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10 of qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 however will be allowed until fully utilized we anticipate full utilization up to the 70 limit until 2014 with full phase out in 2015 our subsidiary in russia benefits from a substantially reduced rate on social contributions and an exemption on value added tax in certain circumstances which is a benefit to qualified it companies in russia if the tax holiday relating to our belarusian subsidiary the tax incentives relating to our hungarian subsidiary or the lower tax rates and social contributions relating to our russian subsidiary are changed terminated not extended or comparable new tax incentives are not introduced we expect that our effective income tax rate andor our operating expenses would increase significantly which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — certain income statement line items — provision for income taxes” 

our ability to expand our business and procure new contracts or enter into beneficial business arrangements could be affected by noncompetition clauses in our agreements with existing clients 

some of our agreements with clients contain timebased restrictions on reassigning personnel from those clients’ accounts to the accounts of competitors of such clients these clauses may restrict our ability to offer services to different clients in a specific industry or market for example we have agreed that for periods ranging from six months to one year after the completion of either the services we have provided to certain clients or the termination of our service agreements with such clients we will not assign any of our employees that have worked on services or projects for such clients to the development or distribution of any services or projects that compete directly or indirectly with the services or projects that we have provided such clients moreover we may in the future enter into agreements with clients that restrict our ability to accept assignments from or render similar services to those clients’ customers require us to obtain our clients’ prior written consent to provide services to their customers or restrict our ability to compete with our clients or bid for or accept any assignment which our client is bidding for or is negotiating these restrictions may hamper our ability to compete for and provide services to other clients in a specific industry in which we have expertise and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our agreement with one of our largest clients gives it the option to assume the operations of one of our offshore development centers and the exercise of that option could result in a loss of future revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 

during the fouryear term of our agreement with one of our largest clients which ends in december 2014 unless extended by the client the client is entitled to request us to transfer to it or its designees all of the operating relationships including employment relationships with the employees dedicated to the offshore development center and contracts with subcontractors at a predetermined transfer price dependent on the experience level of the transferred employee and the duration such employee worked on projects for the client we are required to transfer assets that have already been financed by the client under our agreement such as our offshore development center dedicated to the client at a de minimis preagreed price since our client has already financed such assets the carrying value of such assets is de minimis in addition to the above amounts the client is also required to pay a negotiated value or book value for the assets to be transferred that have not already been financed by the client this client accounted for 63 and 29 of our revenues in 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition under our agreement the client has the right to step in and take over all or part of the offshore 

  

development center in certain instances including if we are in material default under certain provisions of our agreement such as those related to the level or quality of our services or the client has determined it is otherwise obliged to do so in emergencies or for regulatory reasons in the event the client takes over any services we provide under our agreement it will not be obligated to pay us for the provision of those services if the client exercises these rights we would lose future revenues related to the services we provide to the client as well as lose some of our assets and key employees and our losses may not be fully covered by the contractual payment which could adversely affect our results of operations 

undetected software design defects errors or failures may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our services or in liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business 

our software development solutions involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct errors or defects may result in the loss of current clients and loss of or delay in revenues loss of market share loss of client data a failure to attract new clients or achieve market acceptance diversion of development resources and increased support or service costs we cannot assure you that despite testing by us and our clients errors will not be found in new software product development solutions which could result in litigation and other claims for damages against us and thus could materially adversely affect our business 

disruptions in internet infrastructure telecommunications or significant failure in our it systems could harm our service model which could result in a reduction of our revenue 

part of our service model is to maintain active voice and data communications financial control accounting customer service and other data processing systems between our clients’ offices our delivery centers and our client management locations including our headquarters in newtown pa our business activities may be materially disrupted in the event of a partial or complete failure of any of these internet it or communication systems which could be caused by among other things software malfunction computer virus attacks conversion errors due to system upgrading damage from fire earthquake power loss telecommunications failure unauthorized entry demands placed on internet infrastructure by growing numbers of users and time spent online or increased bandwidth requirements or other events beyond our control loss of all or part of the infrastructure or systems for a period of time could hinder our performance or our ability to complete client projects on time which in turn could lead to a reduction of our revenue or otherwise materially adversely affect our business and business reputation 

our computer networks may be vulnerable to security risks that could disrupt our services and cause us to incur losses or liabilities that could adversely affect our business 

our computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses worms malicious applications and other security problems caused by unauthorized access to or improper use of systems by third parties or employees a hacker who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information including personally identifiable information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations although we intend to continue to implement security measures computer attacks or disruptions may jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems actual or perceived concerns that our systems may be vulnerable to such attacks or disruptions may deter our clients from using our solutions or services as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 

data networks are also vulnerable to attacks unauthorized access and disruptions for example in a number of public networks hackers have bypassed firewalls and misappropriated confidential information including personally identifiable information it is possible that despite existing safeguards an employee could misappropriate our clients’ proprietary information or data exposing us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability losses or liabilities that are incurred as a result of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business 

  

if we cause disruptions to our clients’ businesses or provide inadequate service our clients may have claims for substantial damages against us which could cause us to lose clients have a negative effect on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 

if our it professionals make errors in the course of delivering services to our clients or fail to consistently meet service requirements of a client these errors or failures could disrupt the client’s business which could result in a reduction in our revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us in addition a failure or inability to meet a contractual requirement could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 

the services we provide are often critical to our clients’ businesses certain of our client contracts require us to comply with security obligations including maintaining network security and backup data ensuring our network is virusfree maintaining business continuity planning procedures and verifying the integrity of employees that work with our clients by conducting background checks any failure in a client’s system or breach of security relating to the services we provide to the client could damage our reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us any significant failure of our equipment or systems or any major disruption to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications in the locations in which we operate could impede our ability to provide services to our clients have a negative impact on our reputation cause us to lose clients and adversely affect our results of operations 

under our contracts with our clients our liability for breach of our obligations is in some cases limited pursuant to the terms of the contract such limitations may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages in addition certain liabilities such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients are generally not limited under our contracts the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us in amounts greater than those covered by our current insurance policies could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations even if such assertions against us are unsuccessful we may incur reputational harm and substantial legal fees 

our subcontracting practices may expose us to technical uncertainties potential liabilities and reputational harm 

in order to meet our personnel needs increase workforce flexibility and improve pricing competitiveness we use subcontractors and freelancers primarily to perform shortterm assignments in certain specialty areas or on other projects where it is impractical to use our employees or where we need to supplement our resources we also use subcontractors for internal assignments such as assisting in development of internal systems recruiting training human resources consulting and administration and other similar support functions despite certain advantages of subcontracting such arrangements also give rise to a number of risks 

although we try to source competent and credible third parties as our subcontractors they may not be able to deliver the level of service that our clients expect us to deliver furthermore we enter into confidentiality agreements with our subcontractors but we cannot guarantee that they will not breach the confidentiality of us or our clients and misappropriate our or our clients’ proprietary information and technology in the course of providing service we as the party to the contract with the client are directly responsible for the losses our subcontractors cause our clients under the subcontracting agreements we enter into our subcontractors generally promise to indemnify us for damages caused by their breach but we may be unable to collect under these agreements moreover their breaches may damage our reputation cause us to lose existing business and adversely affect our ability to acquire new business in the future 

there may be adverse tax and employment law consequences if the independent contractor status of our it professionals or the exempt status of our employees is successfully challenged 

some of our it professionals are retained as independent contractors although we believe that we have properly classified these individuals as independent contractors there is nevertheless a risk that the irs or another federal state provincial or foreign authority will take a different view furthermore the tests governing 

  

the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification of independent contractors are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities if a federal state provincial or foreign authority or court enacts legislation or adopts regulations that change the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of our independent contractors we could incur significant costs under such laws and regulations including for prior periods in respect of tax withholding social security taxes or payments workers’ compensation and unemployment contributions and recordkeeping or we may be required to modify our business model any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there is also a risk that we may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged noncompliance with federal state provincial or foreign tax laws further if it were determined that any of our independent contractors should be treated as employees we could possibly incur additional liabilities under our applicable employee benefit plans 

in addition we have classified all of our us employees as “exempt” under the federal labor standards act or the flsa if it were determined that any of our us employees should be classified as “nonexempt” under the flsa we may incur costs and liabilities for back wages unpaid overtime fines or penalties andor be subject to employee litigation 

our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us against losses 

although we maintain some insurance coverage including professional liability insurance property insurance coverage for certain of our facilities and equipment and business interruption insurance coverage for certain of our operations we do not insure for all risks in our operations if any claims for injury are brought against us or if we experience any business disruption litigation or natural disaster we might incur substantial costs and diversion of resources 

most of the agreements we have entered into with our clients require us to purchase and maintain specified insurance coverage during the terms of the agreements including commercial general insurance or public liability insurance umbrella insurance product liability insurance and workers’ compensation insurance some of these types of insurance are not available on reasonable terms or at all in cis and cee countries although to date no client has brought any claims against us for such failure our clients have the right to terminate these agreements as a result of such failure 

our business could be negatively affected if we incur legal liability including with respect to our indemnification obligations in connection with providing our solutions and services 

if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to our clients we could be subject to legal liability we may enter into nonstandard agreements because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately adhere to our guidelines in addition the contracting practices of our competitors may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become standard in the marketplace if we cannot or do not perform our obligations we could face legal liability and our contracts might not always protect us adequately through limitations on the scope andor amount of our potential liability if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations to provide solutions and services and if our exposure is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements we might face significant legal liability and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters these arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to defend and hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliates harmless with respect to claims related to matters including our breach of certain representations warranties or covenants or out of our intellectual 

  

property infringement our gross negligence or willful misconduct and certain other claims payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement and any claims under these agreements may not be subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages historically we have not made payments under these indemnification agreements so they have not had any impact on our operating results financial position or cash flows however if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered such payments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by a violation of intellectual property rights the disclosure of other confidential information including personally identifiable information system failures errors or unsatisfactory performance of services and our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover these damages 

we often have access to and are required to collect and store sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information some of our client agreements do not limit our potential liability for breaches of confidentiality infringement indemnity and certain other matters furthermore breaches of confidentiality may entitle the aggrieved party to equitable remedies including injunctive relief if any person including any of our employees penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information we could be subject to significant liability from our clients or from our clients’ customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws the protection of the intellectual property rights and other confidential information or personally identifiable information of our clients is particularly important for us since our operations are mainly based in cis and cee countries cis and cee countries have not traditionally enforced intellectual property protection to the same extent as countries such as the united states despite measures we take to protect the intellectual property and other confidential information or personally identifiable information of our clients unauthorized parties including our employees and subcontractors may attempt to misappropriate certain intellectual property rights that are proprietary to our clients or otherwise breach our clients’ confidences unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client information including personally identifiable information or a violation of intellectual property rights whether through employee misconduct breach of our computer systems systems failure or otherwise may subject us to liabilities damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 

many of our contracts involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients’ businesses and provide benefits to our clients that may be difficult to quantify any failure in a client’s system or any breach of security could result in a claim for substantial damages against us regardless of our responsibility for such failure furthermore any errors by our employees in the performance of services for a client or poor execution of such services could result in a client terminating our engagement and seeking damages from us 

although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in rendering our services these limitations on liability may not apply in all circumstances may be unenforceable in some cases or may be insufficient to protect us from liability for damages there may be instances when liabilities for damages are greater than the insurance coverage we hold and we will have to internalize those losses damages and liabilities not covered by our insurance 

we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business and competitive position 

we rely on a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights as of december 31 2011 we had registered intellectual property consisting of 13 us trademarks 4 nonus trademarks 1 russian 

  

copyright and 77 active domain names implementation of intellectual propertyrelated laws in cis and cee countries has historically been lacking primarily because of ambiguities in the laws and difficulties in enforcement accordingly protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in cis and cee countries may not be as effective as that in the united states or other countries 

to protect our and our clients’ proprietary information and other intellectual property we require our employees independent contractors vendors and clients to enter into written confidentiality agreements with us these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets knowhow or other proprietary information policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technology reverse engineering unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our and our clients’ proprietary technologies tools and applications could enable third parties to benefit from our or our clients’ technologies tools and applications without paying us for doing so and our clients may hold us liable for that act and seek damages and compensation from us which could harm our business and competitive position 

we rely on our trademarks trade names service marks and brand names to distinguish our services and solutions from the services of our competitors and have registered or applied to register several of these trademarks we cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved third parties may oppose our trademark applications or otherwise challenge our use of our trademarks for instance in 2005 we entered into a consent of use and settlement agreement that allowed a third party to use the mark “epam” as capitalized in the foregoing and restricted our ability to do so for more information see “item 1 business — intellectual property” in the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged we could be forced to rebrand our services and solutions which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands further we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks 

we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 

in addition we rely on certain thirdparty software to conduct our business if we lose the licenses which permit us to use such software they may be difficult to replace and it may be costly to do so 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be timeconsuming and costly to defend if we fail to defend ourselves against such claims we may lose significant intellectual property rights and may be unable to continue providing our existing services 

our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology tools code methodologies and services without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties including patents copyrights trade secrets and trademarks we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties we typically indemnify clients who purchase our services and solutions against potential infringement of intellectual property rights which subjects us to the risk of indemnification claims these claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our clients regardless of the merits of these claims and are often not subject to liability limits or exclusion of consequential indirect or punitive damages if any of these claims succeed we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our clients redesign or cease offering our allegedly infringing services or solutions or obtain licenses for the intellectual property such services or solutions allegedly infringe if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms our clients may be forced to stop using our services or solutions 

the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our service offerings may make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms also we may be unaware of 

  

intellectual property registrations or applications relating to our services that may give rise to potential infringement claims against us there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by third parties which may damage our ability to rely on such technologies 

further our current and former employees andor subcontractors could challenge our exclusive rights in the software they have developed in the course of their employment in russia and certain other countries in which we operate an employer is deemed to own the copyright in works created by its employees during the course and within the scope of their employment but the employer may be required to satisfy additional legal requirements in order to make further use and dispose of such works while we believe that we have complied with all such requirements and have fulfilled all requirements necessary to acquire all rights in software developed by our independent contractors andor subcontractors these requirements are often ambiguously defined and enforced as a result we cannot assure that we would be successful in defending against any claim by our current or former employees independent contractors andor subcontractors challenging our exclusive rights over the use and transfer of works those employees independent contractors andor subcontractors created or requesting additional compensation for such works 

we are subject to additional risks as a result of our recent and possible future acquisitions and the hiring of new employees who may misappropriate intellectual property from their former employers the developers of the technology that we have acquired or may acquire may not have appropriately created maintained or enforced intellectual property rights in such technology indemnification and other rights under acquisition documents may be limited in term and scope and may therefore provide little or no protection from these risks parties making infringement claims may be able to obtain an injunction to prevent us from delivering our services or using technology involving the allegedly infringing intellectual property intellectual property litigation is expensive and timeconsuming and could divert management’s attention from our business a successful infringement claim against us whether with or without merit could among others things require us to pay substantial damages develop noninfringing technology or rebrand our name or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and would require us to cease making licensing or using products that have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights protracted litigation could also result in existing or potential clients deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our software product development services or solutions until resolution of such litigation or could require us to indemnify our clients against infringement claims in certain instances any intellectual property claim or litigation in this area whether we ultimately win or lose could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements and violations or unfavorable interpretation by authorities of these regulations could harm our business 

because we provide it services to clients throughout the world we are subject to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal rules on matters as diverse as importexport controls content requirements trade restrictions tariffs taxation sanctions government affairs internal and disclosure control obligations data privacy and labor relations particularly in the cis and cee countries in which we operate our systems and operations are located almost entirely in the cis and cee and laws and regulations that are applicable to us but not to our competitors may impede our ability to develop and offer services that compete effectively with those offered by our noncis or cee based competitors and generally available worldwide violations of these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business could result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business damage to our reputation and other unintended consequences such as liability for monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate local laws might be insufficient to protect our rights our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate concerning our operations including export restrictions us economic sanctions and the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery laws if we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

our operations are subject to laws and regulations restricting our operations including activities involving restricted countries organizations entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to us sanctions imposed by the office of foreign assets control or ofac or other international economic sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries businesses organizations and individuals we are subject to the fcpa which prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and other laws concerning our international operations the fcpa’s foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions although varying in both scope and jurisdiction we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 

we have recently developed and are in the process of implementing formal controls and procedures to ensure that we are in compliance with the fcpa ofac sanctions and similar sanctions laws and regulations the implementation of such procedures may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the discovery of issues or violations with respect to the foregoing by us or our employees independent contractors subcontractors or agents of which we were previously unaware 

any violations of these laws regulations and procedures by our employees independent contractors subcontractors and agents could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties fines or restrictions on export activities including other us laws and regulations as well as foreign and local laws and would adversely affect our reputation and the market for shares of our common stock and may require certain of our investors to disclose their investment in our company under certain state laws if we are not in compliance with export restrictions us or international economic sanctions or other laws and regulations that apply to our operations we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures 

antioutsourcing legislation if adopted could harm our ability to compete effectively and impair our ability to service our clients 

the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries including the united states which is our largest source of revenues many organizations and public figures in the united states and europe have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing it services providers and the loss of jobs in their home countries for example measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by us companies are periodically considered in congress and in numerous state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs in the united states a number of us states have passed legislation that restricts state government entities from outsourcing certain work to offshore it services providers given the ongoing debate over this issue the introduction and consideration of other restrictive legislation is possible if enacted such measures may broaden restrictions on outsourcing by federal and state government agencies and on government contracts with firms that outsource services directly or indirectly impact private industry with measures such as tax disincentives or intellectual property transfer restrictions andor restrict the use of certain business visas in the event that any of these measures becomes law our ability to service our clients could be impaired and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in europe or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of services from an offshore location could also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example legislation 

  

enacted in the united kingdom based on the 1977 ec acquired rights directive has been adopted in some form by many european union countries and provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to an it services provider or changes its current it services provider the affected employees of the company or of the previous it services provider are entitled to become employees of the new it services provider generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment in addition dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous it services provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation as a result in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer and become liable for voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients who outsource business to us in the united kingdom and other european union countries who have adopted similar laws this legislation could materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the united kingdom and european union and to provide outsourced services to companies in the united kingdom and european union in a costeffective manner 

in addition from time to time there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring services from onshore to offshore it services providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore it services provider any slowdown or reversal of the existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from within the country in which our clients operate 

our international sales and operations are subject to many uncertainties 

revenues from clients outside north america represented 488 and 455 of our revenues for 2011 and 2010 respectively we anticipate that clients outside north america will continue to account for a material portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and may increase as we expand our international presence particularly in europe and the cis in addition the majority of our employees along with our development and delivery centers are located in the cis and cee as a result we may be subject to risks inherently associated with international operations including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause volatility in our reported income and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions 

additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property andor contractual rights the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws potentially adverse tax consequences tariffs quotas and other barriers and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in addition we may face competition in other countries from companies that may have more experience with operations in such countries or with international operations additionally such companies may have longstanding or wellestablished relationships with desired clients which may put us at a competitive disadvantage we may also face difficulties integrating new facilities in different countries into our existing operations as well as integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture our international expansion plans may not be successful and we may not be able to compete effectively in other countries there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not impede the success of our international expansion plans or limit our ability to compete effectively in other countries 

restrictions on immigration may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the united states or other countries which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

the vast majority of our employees are nationals of cis and cee countries some of our projects require a portion of the work to be undertaken at our clients’ facilities which are sometimes located outside the cis and cee the ability of our employees to work in the united states europe the cis and other countries outside the cis and cee depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits historically the process 

  

for obtaining visas for nationals of cis and cee countries to certain countries including the united states and europe has been lengthy and cumbersome immigration laws in the united states and in other countries are subject to legislative change as well as to variations in standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions particularly given the recent global economic downturn it is possible that there could be a change in the existing laws or the enactment of new legislation imposing restrictions on the deployment of work visa holders at client locations which could adversely impact our ability to do business in the jurisdictions in which we have clients however it is generally difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or maintaining business visas for our employees our reliance on visas for a number of employees makes us vulnerable to such changes and variations as it affects our ability to staff projects with employees who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed as a result we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of visas for our employees or we may encounter delays or additional costs in obtaining or maintaining such visas in which case we may not be able to provide services to our clients on a timely and costeffective basis or manage our sales and delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could any of which could hamper our growth and cause our revenues to decline 

if we fail to integrate or manage acquired companies efficiently or if the acquired companies are difficult to integrate divert management resources or do not perform to our expectations we may not be able to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisitions and our overall profitability and growth plans could be materially adversely affected 

on occasion we have expanded our service capabilities and gained new clients through selective acquisitions our ability to successfully integrate an acquired entity and realize the benefits of an acquisition requires among other things successful integration of technologies operations and personnel challenges we face in the acquisition and integration process include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in addition the primary value of many potential acquisition targets in the it services industry lies in their skilled it professionals and established client relationships transitioning these types of assets to our business can be particularly difficult due to different corporate cultures and values geographic distance and other intangible factors for example some newly acquired employees may decide not to work with us or to leave shortly after their move to our company and some acquired clients may decide to discontinue their commercial relationships with us these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our expenses including causing us to incur significant onetime expenses and writeoffs and make it more difficult and complex for our management to effectively manage our operations if we are not able to successfully integrate an acquired entity and its operations and to realize the benefits envisioned for such acquisition our overall growth and profitability plans may be adversely affected 

international hostilities terrorist activities other violence or war natural disasters pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could delay or reduce the number of new service orders we receive and impair our ability to service our clients 

hostilities involving the united states and acts of terrorism violence or war such as the attacks of september 11 2001 in the united states the attacks of july 7 2005 in the united kingdom the attacks of april 11 2011 in belarus the continuing conflict in iraq and afghanistan the recent conflict in libya natural disasters global health risks or pandemics or the threat or perceived potential for these events could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to provide services to our clients we may be unable to protect our people facilities and systems against any such occurrences such events may cause clients to delay their decisions on spending for it services and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world whether the facilities are ours or those of our clients which could materially adversely affect our financial results by disrupting communications and travel giving rise to travel restrictions and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highlyskilled and qualified it professionals these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to some or all of our clients travel restrictions could cause us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain the skilled it professionals we need for our operations in addition any extended disruptions of electricity other public utilities or network services at our facilities as well as system failures at or security breaches in our facilities or systems could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients 

we may need additional capital and a failure by us to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all could limit our ability to grow our business and develop or enhance our service offerings to respond to market demand or competitive challenges 

we believe that our current cash cash flow from operations and revolving line of credit should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months we may however require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain another credit facility the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including 

 

  

   

  

  

 existing stockholders have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

as of march 15 2012 to our knowledge our greater than 5 stockholders directors and executive officers and entities affiliated with them own approximately 709 of the outstanding shares of our common stock which includes approximately 423 of the outstanding shares of our common stock owned by affiliates of siguler guff  company as a result these stockholders if acting together would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors the approval of merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other significant business or corporate transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests the concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

risks related to conducting business in the cis and cee countries 

companies doing business in emerging markets such as cis and cee countries are subject to significant economic risks 

cis and cee countries are generally considered to be emerging markets investors in emerging markets should be aware that these markets are subject to greater risks than more developed markets including significant economic risks cee includes albania belarus bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland republic of macedonia romania russia serbia and montenegro slovakia slovenia the former yugoslav republic of macedonia turkey and ukraine the cis is comprised of constituents of the former ussr including armenia azerbaijan belarus georgia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan moldova russia tajikistan turkmenistan ukraine and uzbekistan the economies of cis and cee countries like other emerging economies are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world the economies of belarus russia ukraine hungary and other cis and cee countries where we operate have experienced periods of considerable instability and have been subject to abrupt downturns although economies in cis and cee countries showed positive trends until 2008 including annual increases in the gross domestic product relatively stable currencies strong domestic demand rising real wages and a reduced rate of inflation these trends were interrupted by the global financial crisis in late 2008 in which cis and cee countries experienced adverse economic and financial effects including a substantial decrease in the gross domestic product’s growth rate depreciation of local currencies and a decline in domestic and international demand for their products and services particularly natural resources products on which they are dependent more recently the negative trends of the global economy and volatility in the financial markets partially due to the recent debt crisis in europe have resulted in decreased growth outlooks for cis and cee countries particularly those dependent on western europe for trade 

belarus inherited a heavy industrial base from the soviet era and managed to grow its economy between 2000 and 2010 despite very tight state control of the economy and limited private enterprise while belarus managed to avoid the worst effects of the global economic downturn in 2008 facilitated by years of considerable government spending and cheap oil imports from russia in 2011 belarus has faced a serious balanceofpayment crisis as a result of the upward revision of gas import prices and increased public sector salaries this has led to inflation a shortage of goods and has required the government to significantly devalue its currency and move to a flexible exchange rate policy to raise interest rates and to launch the privatization of a number of stateowned enterprises belarus has also sought financial assistance from the international monetary 

  

fund or the imf russia and other cis countries but as of march 2012 there was uncertainty whether belarus would receive the financial assistance it previously requested from the imf due to political disagreements regarding belarus’ commitments to the reforms requested by the imf it is uncertain whether the government will be able to effectively manage the current financial crisis and implement the reforms requested by the imf 

from 2000 to 2008 the russian economy experienced positive trends such as annual increases in the gross domestic product a relatively stable russian ruble strong domestic demand rising real wages and a reduced rate of inflation however these trends were interrupted by the global financial crisis in late 2008 which led to a substantial decrease in the growth rate of russia’s gross domestic product significant depreciation of the russian ruble and a decline in domestic demand the russian government has taken certain anticrisis measures using the “stabilization fund” and hard currency reserves in order to soften the impact of the global economic downturn on the russian economy and support the value of the russian ruble more recently the weaker global economic landscape and financial market volatility threatened to put pressure on russia’s operating environment affecting its credit environment and financial sector the full impact of the previous global economic downturn and the current volatility in the global economy and financial markets is not yet clear and should global economic conditions deteriorate significantly it is possible that the russian economy could continue to decline in the near future 

despite political instability in ukraine between 2000 and 2008 its economy made significant progress during this period however the global financial crisis in 2008 had a significant impact on ukraine’s economy including the collapse or bailout of certain ukrainian banks and significant liquidity constraints for others the negative outlook in ukraine’s economy may continue as commodity prices of ukrainian exports remain low and access to foreign credit is limited which contributes to exchange rate volatility high inflation and a growing budget deficit continuing political instability also adds to the economic instability 

in hungary budget deficits as a percentage of gdp have remained relatively high over the last several years and the hungarian economy has been marked by a large current account deficit rapid credit growth and a reliance of hungarian businesses and consumers on foreign currency loans these factors left hungary especially vulnerable to the global financial crisis at the end of october 2008 the hungarian government adopted a set of policies agreed upon with the european union the european central bank and the imf to bolster hungary’s nearterm stability and improve its longterm growth potential by ensuring fiscal sustainability and strengthening the financial sector these challenging economic conditions the continuing turmoil in the global economy financial markets and macroeconomic policies made by the government in response to these conditions could materially adversely affect our business in hungary 

as has happened in the past financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies such as in the cis and cee could dampen foreign investment in these markets and materially adversely affect their economies in addition a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions such as the recent debt crisis in europe could require us to reassess the value of goodwill for potential impairment this goodwill is subject to impairment tests on an ongoing basis weakening macroeconomic conditions in the countries in which we operate andor a significant difference between the performance of an acquired company and the business case assumed at the time of acquisition could require us to write down the value of the goodwill or a portion of such value 

these risks may be compounded by incomplete unreliable or unavailable economic and statistical data on cis and cee countries including elements of the information provided in this annual report similar statistics may be obtainable from other nonofficial sources although the underlying assumptions and methodology and consequently the resulting data may vary from source to source further economic instability in belarus russia ukraine hungary or other cis or cee countries where we operate and any future deterioration in the international economic situation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

inflation in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and government efforts to combat inflation may contribute significantly to economic uncertainty in the cis and could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and the market value of our shares of common stock 

economies in cis countries such as belarus russia and ukraine have periodically experienced high rates of inflation in particular in 2011 significant inflation has been reported in belarus the national statistical committee of belarus estimated that inflation was approximately 1532 in 2011 in 2011 and 2010 we had 08 and 12 of our revenues respectively denominated in belarusian rubles 

the measures currently used by the belarusian government to control this recent inflation include monetary policy and pricing instruments including increasing interest rates and the use of antimonopoly laws to prevent the increase in pricing of goods as well as privatization and using foreign borrowings to replenish the budget and stabilize local currency inflation government actions to combat inflation and public speculation about possible additional actions have also contributed materially to economic uncertainty in belarus belarus may experience high levels of inflation in the future the russian and ukrainian governments have historically implemented similar measures as belarus to fight inflation 

periods of higher inflation may slow economic growth in those countries for instance in october 2011 the government of belarus implemented a flexible exchange rate policy which devalued the currency against the us dollar and could cause inflation in belarus over time inflation also is likely to increase some of our costs and expenses which we may not be able to pass on to our clients and as a result may reduce our profitability inflationary pressures could also affect our ability to access financial markets and lead to counterinflationary measures that may harm our financial condition results of operations or adversely affect the market price of our securities 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the belarusian ruble the russian ruble the ukrainian hryvnia the hungarian forint and other cis currencies have experienced significant fluctuations against foreign currencies including the us dollar in recent years for example in february 2009 and may 2011 the national bank of the republic of belarus devalued the exchange rate of the belarusian ruble against the us dollar by 205 and 563 respectively and in october 2011 the national bank adopted a free floating rate policy triggering 520 additional depreciation in the belarusian ruble against the us dollar 

the majority of our revenues are in us dollars british pounds russian rubles and euros and the majority of our expenses particularly salaries of it professionals are denominated in us dollars but payable in belarusian rubles or in other local currencies at the exchange rate in effect at the time however to the extent that we increase our business and revenues which are denominated in belarusian rubles ukrainian hryvnia hungarian forints or other local currencies we will also increase our receivables denominated in those currencies and therefore also increase our exposure to fluctuations in their exchange rates against the us dollar our reporting currency similarly any capital expenditures such as for computer equipment which are payable in the local currency of the countries in which we operate but are imported to such countries and any deposits we hold in local currencies can be materially affected by depreciation of the local currency against the us dollar and the effect of such depreciation on the local economy see “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and “— inflation in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and government efforts to combat inflation may contribute significantly to economic uncertainty in the cis and could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and the market value of our shares of common stock” 

  

the banking and financial systems in the cis remain less developed than those in some more developed markets and a banking crisis could place liquidity constraints on our business and materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

banking and other financial systems in the cis are less developed and regulated than in some more developed markets and legislation relating to banks and bank accounts is subject to varying interpretations and inconsistent application banks in the cis generally do not meet the banking standards of more developed markets and the transparency of the banking sector lags behind international standards furthermore in russia belarus and other cis countries bank deposits made by corporate entities generally are not insured as a result the banking sector remains subject to periodic instability another banking crisis or the bankruptcy or insolvency of banks through which we receive or with which we hold funds particularly in belarus may result in the loss of our deposits or adversely affect our ability to complete banking transactions in the cis which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 

political and governmental instability in cis and cee countries could materially adversely affect our business and operations in these countries 

since the early 1990s belarus russia ukraine hungary and other cis and cee countries have sought to transform from oneparty states with a centrally planned economy to democracies with a market economy of various degrees as a result of the sweeping nature of various reforms and the failure of some of them the political systems of many cis and cee countries remain vulnerable to popular dissatisfaction including demands for autonomy from particular regional and ethnic groups 

we have significant operations in minsk the capital of belarus belarus has been governed since 1994 by president alexander lukashenko who was most recently reelected in december 2010 the president has a wide range of powers including the power to call elections appoint the executive arms of the government make judicial appointments and appointments to local executive and administrative bodies and issue edicts orders and decrees which have the force of law progress on structural reform and a reduction in the extent of direct state support in the economy has been slow in belarus and reforms of this nature are likely to be politically unpopular no assurance however can be given that belarus will implement further structural reform policies or reduce state support of the economy 

we have significant operations in russia since 1991 russia has sought to transform itself from a single party state with a centrallyplanned economy to a market economy political conditions in russia were highly volatile in the 1990s as evidenced by the frequent conflicts among executive legislative and judicial authorities which negatively affected russia’s business and investment climate during the presidency of vladimir putin and dmitry medvedev the political and economic situation in russia has generally become more stable however there is still a risk of significant changes to the political and economic environment potential changes in the direction of the reforms or reversal of the reforms on december 4 2011 parliamentary elections took place in russia as a result of which united russia the ruling party gained 53 of seats compared to 70 in the previous parliament following the elections a number of nonviolent public protests took place in moscow and other russian cities claiming violations and fraud during the elections and demanding among other things cancellation of the election results and reelections on march 4 2012 vladimir putin supported by dmitry medvedev and united russia was elected president the outcome of the presidential election and the potential shift in government policy may affect the direction and speed of economic and political reforms and negatively impact the economic and political environment in russia 

we have delivery centers in ukraine since obtaining independence in 1991 ukraine has undergone substantial political transformation to become an independent sovereign state and has been on the path of economic transition to a market economy the 2010 presidential election and the subsequent removal of the ukrainian prime minister from office created tensions between the ukrainian president viktor yanukovych the government and the parliament a number of factors could adversely affect political stability in ukraine 

  

including political polarization in ukrainian society resulting from what is seen as insufficiently balanced or controversial positions of the president and the government on various domestic and foreign policy issues and growing opposition of certain factions in the parliament and certain political parties and associations which are not represented in the parliament to what are broadly seen as significant concessions made by the president and the government to russia recent political developments have also highlighted potential inconsistencies between ukraine’s constitution and various laws and presidential decrees after ukraine’s refusal to join the customs union was ratified by russia kazakhstan and belarus in june 2011 the customs union has taken a number of additional restrictive measures with respect to imports from ukraine if political instability continues or heightens it may have negative effects on the ukrainian economy and our operations in ukraine 

we have delivery centers in hungary hungary was established as a parliamentary republic in 1989 and joined the european union in 2004 in april 2010 prime minister viktor orbán’s political party won a twothirds parliamentary majority and has sought to centralize power to make changes to formerly independent government institutions to draft a new constitution and to impose taxes on telecommunications energy retail and banking institutions in an effort to meet budget deficit targets the politics of hungary remain volatile as shown by large protests in may 2011 against the ruling party’s actions political instability as a reaction to the government’s actions could negatively affect the hungarian economy and political environment 

current and future changes in the belarusian russian ukrainian hungarian and other cis and cee governments major policy shifts or lack of consensus between various branches of the government and powerful economic groups could disrupt or reverse economic and regulatory reforms any disruption or reversal of reform policies could lead to political or governmental instability or the occurrence of conflicts among powerful economic groups which could materially adversely affect our business and operations in cee and the cis 

a deterioration in political and economic relations among the cis countries in which we operate andor between cis countries and the united states and the european union could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

political and economic relations between belarus russia ukraine and the other countries in which we operate are complex and recent conflicts have arisen between their governments political ethnic religious historical and other differences have on occasion given rise to tensions and in certain cases military conflict between countries of the cis which can halt normal economic activity and disrupt the economies of neighboring regions 

a significant portion of belarus energy imports come from russia and russia is belarus’ most significant trading partner a number of oil and gas pipelines from russia to european union member states run through belarus and a significant portion of russian energy exports are delivered through belarus russia is also one of belarus’ main sovereign lenders belarus and russia have had a number of disagreements regarding the level of duty to be imposed on russian crude oil exports to belarus which comprise a significant part of belarus’ energy resources and are important for belarus’ oil refinery industry in june 2010 belarus and russia had a dispute regarding the timing of payments due from belarus to russia for gas supplied by russia and from russia to belarus for the transit of russian gas to the european union which resulted in a disruption of gas flows to the european union 

the relationship between russia and ukraine has been historically strained due to among other things disagreements over the prices and methods of payment for gas delivered by russia to or for transportation through ukraine issues relating to the temporary stationing of the russian black sea fleet in the territory of ukraine and a russian ban on imports of meat and milk products from ukraine and antidumping investigations conducted by russian authorities in relation to certain ukrainian goods results of the current litigation against exprime minister yulia timoshenko who was sentenced to 7 years in prison could add to political instability and tension in relationships with the european union and the united states the possible accession by ukraine to the north atlantic treaty organization has also been a significant source of tension between russia and ukraine 

  

following the presidential election in february 2010 ukraine’s relations with russia have generally improved however any further adverse changes in ukraine’s relations with russia in particular any such changes adversely affecting supplies of energy resources from russia to ukraine or ukraine’s revenues derived from transit charges for russian oil and gas may have negative effects on the ukrainian economy as a whole 

although we operate in the cis through local subsidiaries governmental officials and consumers may associate us and our brand with a particular cis country or with the united states any deterioration in political and economic relations among cis countries in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the conflicts among cis countries and conflicts within cis countries have in some instances also strained their relationship with the united states and the european union which at times has negatively impacted their financial markets for instance the december 2010 belarus presidential elections coincided with largescale street protests and were criticized as antidemocratic by the foreign ministers of some european nations and by the united states and canada in january 2011 the european union and the united states announced financial and travel sanctions against the belarusian government and belarusian stateowned enterprises in june 2011 the european union agreed to a series of new sanctions against certain additional belarusian individuals and enterprises in august 2011 the united states imposed further economic sanctions against certain additional belarusian individuals and enterprises and in response belarus announced it would suspend an agreement with the united states to reduce certain uranium stockpiles held in belarus the united states passed further sanctions against certain belarusian individuals and enterprises in january 2012 no assurance can be given that belarus will improve relations with the european union and the united states or that further restrictions will not be imposed by the european union or the united states in relation to these points of tension or that such frictions will not affect the political and economic environment in belarus trade and economic sanctions including existing european union and united states sanctions and asset freezes prevent us from dealing with certain entities and persons in belarus and impose legal compliance costs and risks on our business operations in that country 

the emergence of new or escalated tensions among cis countries could further exacerbate tensions between cis countries and the united states and the european union which may have a negative effect on their economy our ability to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms and the level and volatility of the trading price of our shares of common stock any of the foregoing circumstances could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

the legal systems in cis countries can create an uncertain environment for business activity which could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

the legal framework to support a market economy remains new and in flux in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and as a result these legal systems can be characterized by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in addition as is true of civil law systems generally judicial precedents generally have no binding effect on subsequent decisions not all legislation and court decisions in cis countries are readily available to the public or organized in a manner that facilitates understanding enforcement of court orders can in practice be very difficult all of these factors make judicial decisions difficult to predict and effective redress uncertain additionally court claims and governmental prosecutions may be used in furtherance of what some perceive to be political aims 

the untested nature of much of recent legislation in the countries in which we operate and the rapid evolution of their legal systems may result in ambiguities inconsistencies and anomalies in the application and interpretation of laws and regulations any of these factors may affect our ability to enforce our rights under our contracts or to defend ourselves against claims by others or result in our being subject to unpredictable requirements and could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

these uncertainties also extend to property rights for example during the transformation of russia belarus ukraine and other cis countries from centrally planned economies to market economies legislation has generally been enacted in each of these countries to protect private property against uncompensated expropriation and nationalization however there is a risk that due to the lack of experience in enforcing these provisions and due to political factors these protections would not be enforced in the event of an attempted expropriation or nationalization expropriation or nationalization of any of our entities their assets or portions thereof potentially without adequate compensation could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

selective or arbitrary government action including in connection with agreements to provide services to local governments could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

many commercial laws and regulations in the cis are relatively new and have been subject to limited interpretation as a result their application can be unpredictable government authorities have a high degree of discretion in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and have at times exercised their discretion in ways that may be perceived as selective or arbitrary and sometimes in a manner that is seen as being influenced by political or commercial considerations these governments also have the power in certain circumstances to interfere with the performance of nullify or terminate contracts selective or arbitrary actions have included withdrawal of licenses sudden and unexpected tax audits criminal prosecutions and civil actions federal and local government entities have also used common defects in documentation as pretexts for court claims and other demands to invalidate andor to void transactions apparently for political purposes we cannot assure you that regulators judicial authorities or third parties in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries will not challenge our compliance including that of our subsidiaries with applicable laws decrees and regulations selective or arbitrary government action could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the russian government has taken various actions in recent years against business people and companies operating in russia that have been perceived as having been politically motivated including actions for technical violations of law or violations of laws that have been applied retroactively such as violations of tax laws in 2008 for example government officials publicly criticized transfer pricing arrangements used by a russianbased company that is publicly traded in the united states claiming that such arrangements constituted tax evasion these claims resulted in a steep decline in that company’s stock price such actions have on occasion resulted in significant fluctuations in the market prices of the securities of businesses operating in russia a weakening of investor confidence in russia and doubts about the progress of market and political reforms in russia government officials may apply contradictory or ambiguous laws or regulations in ways that could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

  

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of government contracts in the cis and cee countries where we provide services to the local governments including belarus russia and ukraine any failure to comply with applicable local laws regulations and procedures could result in contract termination damage to our reputation price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the government each of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition governments may revise existing contract rules and regulations or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time and for any reason any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew or enforce contracts under which we currently provide services any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement which could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the cis 

changes in the tax system in cis or cee countries or arbitrary or unforeseen application of existing rules could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

there have been significant changes to the taxation systems in cis countries in recent years as the authorities have gradually replaced legislation regulating the application of major taxes such as corporate income tax vat corporate property tax and other taxes with new legislation tax authorities in cis and cee countries including belarus russia and ukraine have also been aggressive in their interpretation of tax laws and their many ambiguities as well as in their enforcement and collection activities technical violations of contradictory laws and regulations many of which are relatively new and have not been subject to extensive application or interpretation can lead to penalties highprofile companies can be particularly vulnerable to aggressive application of unclear requirements many companies must negotiate their tax bills with tax inspectors who may demand higher taxes than applicable law appears to provide our tax liability may become greater than the estimated amount that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheets particularly if the tax benefits we receive in belarus and hungary are changed or removed see “— risks relating to our business — our operating results may be negatively impacted by the loss of certain tax benefits provided by the governments of belarus hungary and russia to companies in our industry” any additional tax liability as well as any unforeseen changes in tax laws could materially adversely affect our future results of operations financial condition or cash flows in a particular period 

the tax environment in russia historically has been complicated by contradictions in russian tax law for example tax laws are unclear with respect to the deductibility of certain expenses and tax authorities may disagree with positions we have taken that we consider to be in compliance with current law this uncertainty could result in a greater than expected tax burden and potentially exposes us to significant fines and penalties and enforcement measures despite our best efforts at compliance 

in october 2006 the supreme arbitration court of russia issued a ruling that introduced the concept of an “unjustified tax benefit” which is a benefit that may be disallowed for tax purposes specific examples cited by the court include benefits obtained under transactions lacking a business purpose ie when the only purpose of a deal or structure is to derive tax benefits the tax authorities have actively sought to apply this concept when challenging tax positions taken by taxpayers although the intention of the ruling was to combat tax abuse in practice there is no assurance that the tax authorities will not seek to apply this concept in a broader sense than may have been intended by the court in addition the tax authorities and the courts have indicated a willingness to interpret broadly the application of criminal responsibility for tax violations 

historically ukraine had a number of laws related to various taxes imposed by both central and regional governmental authorities these taxes include value added tax corporate income tax profits tax customs duties and payroll social taxes in january 2011 the majority of the new tax code in ukraine came into effect and aims to create a comprehensive legal framework for tax reform and provide for a wide range of changes to the existing tax system in the areas of tax collection and administration among other things the new ukraine tax code provides for a decrease in the rate of the corporate income tax over the next several years a decrease in the vat rate beginning in 2014 and for taxation of interest accrued on bank deposits beginning in 2015 there can 

  

be no assurance that the adoption of the tax code will have a positive effect on the ukrainian tax system in which differing opinions regarding legal interpretations often exist both among and within governmental ministries and organizations including the tax administration creating uncertainties and areas of conflict tax declarations or returns together with other matters of legal compliance such as customs and currency control matters are subject to review and investigation by a number of authorities which may impose fines penalties and interest charges for noncompliance in practice the ukrainian tax authorities tend to interpret the tax laws in an arbitrary way that rarely favors taxpayers these circumstances generally create tax risks in ukraine that are more significant than those typically found in countries with more developed tax systems 

our subsidiaries in ukraine also currently benefit from regulations that permit companies in the it services industry to employ independent contractors and significantly reduce our social security tax obligations in ukraine substantially all of our it professionals in ukraine are independent contractors should ukraine change its tax regulations and no longer permit the it services industry to employ independent contractors our operating expenses in ukraine would substantially increase which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the tax systems in cis and cee countries in which we operate impose additional burdens and costs on our operations in such countries and complicate our tax planning and related business decisions the uncertainty involved potentially exposes us to significant fines penalties and enforcement measures despite our best efforts at compliance which could result in a greater than expected tax burden on our subsidiaries these factors raise the risk of a sudden imposition of arbitrary or onerous taxes on our operations in these countries this could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be exposed to liability for actions taken by our subsidiaries 

in certain cases in particular under the laws of russia we may be jointly and severally liable for obligations of our subsidiaries we may also incur secondary liability and in certain cases liability to creditors for obligations of our subsidiaries in certain instances involving bankruptcy or insolvency this type of liability could result in significant obligations and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our cis subsidiaries can be forced into liquidation on the basis of formal noncompliance with certain legal requirements 

we operate in cis countries primarily through locally organized subsidiaries certain provisions of russian law and the laws of other cis countries may allow a court to order liquidation of a locally organized legal entity on the basis of its formal noncompliance with certain requirements during formation reorganization or during its operations 

for example in russian corporate law if the net assets of a russian joint stock company calculated on the basis of russian accounting standards are lower than its charter capital as at the end of its third or any subsequent financial year the company must either decrease its charter capital or liquidate if the company fails to comply with these requirements governmental or local authorities can seek the involuntary liquidation of such company in court and the company’s creditors will have the right to accelerate their claims or demand early performance of the company’s obligations as well as demand compensation of any damages 

similarly there have also been cases in cis countries in which formal deficiencies in the establishment process of a legal entity or noncompliance with provisions of law have been used by courts as a basis for liquidation of a legal entity weaknesses in the legal systems of cis countries create an uncertain legal environment which makes the decisions of a court or a governmental authority difficult if not impossible to predict if involuntary liquidation of any of our subsidiaries were to occur such liquidation could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

crime and corruption could disrupt our ability to conduct our business 

political and economic changes in the cis countries where we operate in recent years have resulted in significant dislocations of authority the local and international press have reported the existence of significant organized criminal activity particularly in large metropolitan centers property crime in large cities has increased substantially in addition the local and international press have reported high levels of corruption including the bribing of officials for the purpose of initiating investigations by government agencies press reports have also described instances in which state officials have engaged in selective investigations and prosecutions to further the interests of the state and individual officials as well as private businesses including competitors and corporate raiders corruption in the cis countries in which we operate is pervasive and in some cases is worsening the governments in cis countries including belarus russia and ukraine have recently pursued campaigns against corruption the results of which are currently uncertain for example the ukrainian parliament is currently considering new anticorruption legislation which contains provisions relating to measures to prevent corruption introduces a more detailed regulation of responsibility for involvement in corruption and provides for international cooperation in combating corruption in addition in august 2010 a new antimoney laundering law entered into force in ukraine extends the list of entities that are required to monitor financial transactions extends the list of state agencies authorized to conduct state financial monitoring and broadens the list of reasons on the basis of which a financial transaction may be subject to monitoring however there is no assurance that such laws or other laws enacted elsewhere will be applied with any effectiveness by the local authorities and the continuing effects of corruption money laundering and other criminal activity could have a negative effect on the economies of these countries and could materially adversely affect our business in the cis 

additionally some members of the media in the countries in which we operate regularly publish disparaging articles in return for payment the depredations of organized or other crime demands of corrupt officials or claims that we have been involved in official corruption could result in negative publicity which could disrupt our ability to conduct our business 

social instability in cis countries could lead to increased support for centralized authority and a rise in nationalism which could harm our business 

social instability in cis countries coupled with difficult economic conditions could lead to labor and social unrest labor and social unrest may have political social and economic consequences such as increased support for centralized authority and a rise in nationalism these sentiments could lead to restrictions on foreign ownership of companies in our industry or largescale nationalization or expropriation of foreignowned assets or businesses there is relatively little experience in enforcing legislation enacted to protect private property against nationalization or expropriation as a result we may not be able to obtain proper redress in the courts and we may not receive adequate compensation if in the future cis governments decide to nationalize or expropriate some or all of our assets if this occurs our business could be harmed 

in addition ethnic religious historical regional and other divisions have on occasion given rise to tensions and in certain cases military conflict the spread of violence or its intensification could have significant political consequences including the imposition of a state of emergency in some parts or throughout cis countries these events could materially adversely affect the investment environment in cis countries 

any us or other foreign judgments that may be obtained against us may be difficult to enforce in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries 

although we are a delaware corporation subject to suit in the united states and other courts many of our assets are located in belarus russia ukraine and other cis countries and one of our directors and his assets are located outside the united states although arbitration awards are generally enforceable in cis countries judgments obtained in the united states or in other foreign courts including those with respect to us federal securities law claims may not be enforceable in many cis countries including belarus russia and ukraine 

  

there is no mutual recognition treaty between the united states and belarus russia or ukraine therefore it may be difficult to enforce any us or other foreign court judgment obtained against any of our operating subsidiaries in cis countries 

we face risks similar to those in belarus russia and ukraine in other cis or cee countries or elsewhere 

we currently have operations in belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan poland and hungary we may acquire additional operations in other cis or cee countries or elsewhere as with belarus russia ukraine kazakhstan poland and hungary such countries are emerging markets subject to greater political economic social tax and legal risks than more developed markets in many respects the risks inherent in transacting business in such countries are similar to those in belarus russia and ukraine especially those risks set out above in “— risks related to conducting business in the cis and cee countries”

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report in addition to historical information this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and “item 7a risk factors” we assume no obligation to update any of these forwardlooking statements please note that we effected an 8 for 1 common stock split on january 19 2012 and all historical common stock and per share information has been changed to reflect the common stock split 

overview 

we are a leading global it services provider focused on complex software product development services software engineering and verticallyoriented custom development solutions since our inception in 1993 we have been serving independent software vendors or isvs and technology companies the foundation we have built serving isvs and technology companies has enabled us to differentiate ourselves in the market for software engineering skills and technology capabilities our work with these clients exposes us to their customers’ challenges across a variety of industry “verticals” this has enabled us to develop verticalspecific domain expertise and grow our business in multiple industry verticals including banking and financial services business information and media travel and hospitality and retail and consumer 

our delivery centers in belarus ukraine russia hungary kazakhstan and poland are strategically located in centers of software engineering talent and educational excellence across cee or the cis our applications tools methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions from our delivery centers to global clients thereby further strengthening our relationships with them we also have client management locations in the united states united kingdom germany sweden russia switzerland and kazakhstan 

our clients primarily consist of forbes global 2000 corporations located in north america europe and the cis our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 860 and 705 of our revenues in 2011 coming from clients that had used our services for at least two and three years respectively 

recent developments 

on february 13 2012 we completed our initial public offering of 6900000 shares of our common stock which included 900000 shares of our common stock sold by us pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters were sold at a price to the public of 1200 per share of the 6900000 shares of common stock sold we issued and sold 2900000 shares of common stock and our selling stockholders sold 4000000 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds to us of 348 million and 295 million in net proceeds to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 23 million and estimated offering expenses of approximately 30 million we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders 

factors affecting our results of operations 

we have benefited significantly from growth in the global software development services industry growth in the industry is driven by the needs of major corporations to maintain and upgrade the technology and services required to operate in a costefficient manner software companies are also increasingly outsourcing work to it services providers in order to streamline and reduce the cost of the software development process the cee 

  

software development services market is growing rapidly due to its large pool of skilled it professionals highlydeveloped infrastructure strong government support and incentives the geographic and cultural proximity between cee countries and europe and the desire of clients to diversify their use of software development services to multiple delivery locations 

the growth in the global software development services industry has also increased the cost of attracting and retaining high quality it professionals in cee and the cis at a higher rate than we have historically faced in addition we face competition from offshore it services providers in emerging outsourcing destinations with low wage costs such as india and china and our clients’ buying patterns could change if they become more price sensitive and accepting of lowcost suppliers we believe the epam brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of our competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees in cee and the cis we seek to accurately manage our pricing and cost estimates when negotiating contract terms with our clients to ensure we are able to maintain appropriate levels of project profitability while providing a high quality of service we also seek to maintain optimal resource utilization levels and productivity with the efficient allocation of our it professionals and facilities in our development centers in cee and the cis 

we believe that the most significant factors affecting our results of operations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our results of operations in any given period are also directly affected by companyspecific factors including 

 

  

  

  

 certain income statement line items 

revenues 

revenues are derived primarily from providing software development services to our clients during the third quarter of 2008 we started to experience a decrease in demand for our services as a result of the global economic downturn which also continued to adversely affect demand during 2009 however in 2010 and 2011 we experienced rapid growth in demand for our services and significantly expanded our business in 2010 revenues increased by 479 to 2218 million from 1499 million in 2009 and increased by 508 to 3345 million in 2011 from 2218 million in 2010 we discuss below the breakdown of our revenues by service offering vertical client location contract type and client concentration revenues consist of it services revenues and reimbursable expenses and other revenues which primarily include travel and entertainment costs that are chargeable to clients 

  

revenues by service offering 

software development includes software product development custom application development services and enterprise application platforms services and has historically represented and we expect to continue to represent the substantial majority of our business the following table sets forth revenues by service offering by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 revenues by vertical 

the foundation we have built with isvs and technology companies has enabled us to leverage our strong domain knowledge and industryspecific knowledge capabilities to become a premier it services provider to a range of additional verticals such as banking and financial services business information and media travel and hospitality and retail and consumer the following table sets forth revenues by vertical by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

   

revenues by client location 

our revenues are sourced from three geographic markets north america europe and the cis we present our revenues by client location based on the location of the specific client site that we serve irrespective of the location of the headquarters of the client or the location of the delivery center where the work is performed as such revenues by client location differ from the segment information in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which is not solely based on the geographic location of the clients but rather is based on managerial responsibility for a particular client regardless of client location the following table sets forth revenues by client location by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 revenues by contract type 

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice arrangements our engagement models depend on the type of services provided to a client the mix and locations of professionals involved and the business outcomes our clients are looking to achieve historically the majority of our revenues have been generated under timeandmaterial contracts under timeandmaterial contracts we are compensated for actual time incurred by our it professionals at negotiated hourly daily or monthly rates fixedprice contracts require us to perform services throughout the contractual period and we are paid in installments on preagreed intervals we expect timeandmaterial arrangements to continue to comprise the majority of our revenues in the future 

the following table sets forth revenues by contract type by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 revenues by client concentration 

we have grown our revenues from our clients by continually expanding the scope and size of our engagements and we have grown our key client base through internal business development efforts and several strategic acquisitions 

  

our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 860 and 705 of our revenues in 2011 coming from clients that had used our services for at least two and three years respectively in addition we have significantly grown the size of existing accounts the number of clients that accounted for over 50 million in annual revenues increased to 15 in 2011 from 10 in 2010 and the number of clients that generated at least 05 million in revenues increased to 98 in 2011 from 72 in 2010 

the following table sets forth revenues contributed by our top five and top ten clients by amount and as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 

 

 in 2011 our largest client thomson reuters accounted for over 10 of our revenues the volume of work we perform for specific clients is likely to vary from year to year as we are typically not any client’s exclusive external it services provider and a major client in one year may not contribute the same amount or percentage of our revenues in any subsequent year 

operating expenses 

cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization 

the principal components of our cost of revenues exclusive of depreciation and amortization are salaries employee benefits and stock compensation expense travel costs and subcontractor fees salaries and other compensation expenses of our it professionals are allocated to cost of revenues regardless of whether they are actually performing services during a given period 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses represent expenses associated with promoting and selling our services and include such items as senior management administrative personnel and sales and marketing personnel salaries stock compensation expense and related fringe benefits legal and audit expenses commissions insurance operating lease expenses travel costs and the cost of advertising and other promotional activities in addition we pay a membership fee of 1 of revenues collected in belarus to the administrative organization of the belarus hitech park 

our selling general and administrative expenses have increased primarily as a result of our expanding operations acquisitions and the hiring of a number of senior managers to support our growth we expect our selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute terms as our business expands but will generally remain steady or slightly decrease as a percentage of our revenues 

provision for income taxes 

determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance if any involves judgment as a global company we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate during 2011 2010 and 2009 we had 499 million 303 million and 143 million respectively in income before provision for income taxes attributed to our foreign jurisdictions the statutory tax rate in our foreign jurisdictions is lower than the statutory us tax rate additionally we have secured special tax benefits in belarus and hungary as described below as a result our provision for income taxes is low in comparison to income before taxes due to the benefit received from increased income earned in low tax jurisdictions the foreign tax rate differential represents this significant reduction changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income can also affect our overall effective income tax rate 

  

our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions as well as the related net interest tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we cannot assure you that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from our current estimates we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit statute of limitation lapse or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our subsidiary in belarus is a member of the belarus hitech park in which member technology companies are 100 exempt from the current belarusian income tax rate of 24 the “on hightechnologies park” decree which created the belarus hitech park is in effect for a period of 15 years from july 1 2006 

our subsidiary in hungary benefits from a tax credit of 10 of annual qualified salaries taken over a fouryear period for up to 70 of the total tax due for that period we have been able to take the full 70 credit for 2007 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 the hungarian tax authorities repealed the tax credit beginning with 2012 credits earned in years prior to 2012 will be allowed until fully utilized we anticipate full utilization up to the 70 limit until 2014 with full phase out in 2015 

our domestic income before provision for income taxes differs from the north america segment operating profit because segment operating profit is a management reporting measure which does not take into account most corporate expenses as well as the majority of nonoperating costs and stock compensation expenses we do not hold our segment managers accountable for these expenses as they cannot influence these costs within the scope of their operating authority nor do we believe it is practical to allocate these costs to specific segments as they are not directly attributable to any specific segment all our segments are treated consistently with respect to such expenses when determining segment operating profit

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources 

at december 31 2011 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling 888 million and 300 million of available borrowings under our revolving line of credit 

at december 31 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of 888 million of which 555 million was held outside the united states including 242 million held in us dollar denominated accounts in belarus which accrued at an average interest rate of 65 during 2010 and 2011 we have a 300 million revolving line of credit with pnc bank national association advances under our revolving line of credit accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the london interbank offer rate or libor plus 125 our revolving line of credit is secured by the grant of a security interest in all of our us trade receivables and cash on hand in favor of the bank and contains customary financial and reporting covenants and limitations we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our revolving line of credit and believe that our revolving line of credit provides sufficient flexibility so that we will remain in compliance with its terms in the foreseeable future our revolving line of credit expires on october 15 2013 at december 31 2011 we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit 

the cash and cash equivalents held at locations outside of the united states are for future operating expenses and we have no intention of repatriating those funds we are not however restricted in repatriating those funds back to the united states if necessary if we decide to remit funds to the united states in the form of dividends 551 million would be subject to foreign withholding taxes of which 46 million would also be 

  

subject to us corporate income tax we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents held in the united states and cash flow to be generated from domestic operations will be adequate to satisfy our domestic liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 

we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations in the foreseeable future our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our longterm capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate if any at which our cash flows increase our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from outside the us and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing to the extent we pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operations increased by 340 million to 545 million during 2011 from 205 million net cash provided by operations during 2010 primarily attributable to higher net income that increased by 177 million before accounting for noncash items in 2011 as compared to 2010 revenues increased by 508 in 2011 as compared to 2010 causing net trade and unbilled accounts receivable to increase 186 million or 284 from 654 million as of december 31 2010 to 839 million as of december 31 2011 amounts due to employees the majority of which represents payroll costs for the most recent period increased by 25 million or 448 from 57 million as of december 31 2010 to 82 million as of december 31 2011 driven by headcount growth 

net cash provided by operations decreased by 56 million to 205 million during 2010 from 261 million during 2009 this was primarily attributable to increases in trade and unbilled accounts receivable accrued expenses and taxes payable and was offset by higher net income revenues increased 479 in 2010 as compared to 2009 causing net trade and unbilled accounts receivable to increase to 654 million or 579 as of december 31 2010 from 414 million as of december 31 2009 accrued expenses increased to 150 million as of december 31 2010 from 49 million as of december 31 2009 due to an overall growth in operating expenses to support revenue growth and also attributable to a 78 million increase in the yearend bonus accrual as a result of strong overall performance in 2010 as compared to 2009 

  

investing activities 

net cash of 171 million was used in investing activities during 2011 as compared to 108 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2010 during 2011 capital expenditures increased by 1043 to 171 million primarily associated with it equipment acquisitions to support our growth in headcount and 15 million spent on construction of a new building in belarus 

net cash of 108 million was used in investing activities during 2010 as compared to 90 million of net cash used in investing activities during 2009 this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures which primarily consisted of it equipment of 73 million related to our increased headcount and a 25 million increase in restricted cash related to a client letter of credit and was partially offset by a payment of 84 million for construction of a building in minsk in 2009 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2011 decreased by 65 million to 16 million as compared to 80 million net cash used during 2010 this was primarily due to a decrease in the amount outstanding under our revolving line of credit by 70 million partially offset by 16 million of public offering costs 

net cash of 80 million was used in financing activities during 2010 as compared to 65 million of net cash provided by financing activities during 2009 this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of treasury stock of 68 million the partial repurchase of 151 million of our series a2 convertible redeemable preferred stock and a repayment of amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit of 70 million in 2010 which was borrowed in 2009 this decrease in 2010 was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the sale of treasury stock net of costs of 63 million and proceeds from the issuance of 150 million of preferred stock in 2010 

contractual obligations and future capital requirements 

contractual obligations 

set forth below is information concerning our fixed and determinable contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 

 

  

  future capital requirements 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future our ability to generate cash 

  

however is subject to our performance general economic conditions industry trends and other factors to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing if we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur if we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business there is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 

offbalance sheet commitments and arrangements 

we do not have any investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt accordingly our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are not subject to offbalance sheet risks 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap which require us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities ii disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and iii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations regarding the future based on available information and reasonable assumptions which together form a basis for making judgments about matters not readily apparent from other sources since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process actual results could differ from those estimates some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application when reviewing our audited consolidated financial statements you should consider i our selection of critical accounting policies ii the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies and iii the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the audited consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most sensitive and require more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements you should read the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenues primarily from software development services we recognize revenues when realized or realizable and earned which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured if there is an uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved at the time revenues are recognized we provide for client incentive programs and reduce revenues accordingly 

we defer amounts billed to our clients for revenues not yet earned such amounts are anticipated to be recorded as revenues as services are performed in subsequent periods unbilled revenues represent services provided which are billed subsequent to the period end in accordance with the contract terms all such amounts are anticipated to be realized in subsequent periods 

  

our services are performed under both timeandmaterial and fixedprice contracts arrangements for revenues generated under timeandmaterial contracts revenues are recognized as services are performed with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of revenues when incurred the majority of such revenues are billed on an hourly daily or monthly basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the client 

we recognize revenues from fixedprice contracts based on the proportional performance method in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the client revenues are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met in absence of a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized upon receipt of final acceptance from the client the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our audited consolidated financial statements a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor hours and specification and testing requirement changes the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known our fixed price contracts are generally recognized over a period of twelve months or less 

we enter into multiple element arrangements with our clients under timeandmaterial and fixedfee contracts in october 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables we adopted this standard effective january 1 2010 for all new or amended contracts and it did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations or change our units of accounting and how we allocate the arrangement consideration to various units of accounting these arrangements consist of development services and other service deliverables that qualify for separate units of accounting these other services include maintenance and support services for our timeandmaterial contracts and separately priced warranties for our fixedfee contracts these deliverables qualify for multiple units of accounting and therefore arrangement consideration is allocated among the units of accounting based on their relative selling price the relative selling price is based on the price charged for the deliverable when it is sold separately for multiple element arrangements under timeandmaterial contracts revenue is recognized as services are performed for each deliverable for arrangements under fixedfee contracts revenue is recognized upon delivery of development services under the proportional performance method and on a straightline basis over the warranty period the warranty period is generally six months to two years 

we report gross reimbursable “outofpocket” expenses incurred as both revenues and cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of income 

accounts receivable 

accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative creditworthiness of each client historical collections experience and other information including the aging of the receivables recoveries of losses from accounts receivable written off in prior years are presented within income from operations on our consolidated statements of income 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates these judgments can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 

  

we do not amortize goodwill but perform a test for impairment annually or when indications of potential impairment exist utilizing a fair value approach at the reporting unit level we determine fair value using the income approach which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting units to which goodwill relates and determine the carrying value book value of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units 

we amortize other intangible assets with determinable lives over their estimated useful lives we record an impairment charge on these assets when we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition when there exists one or more indicators of impairment we measure any impairment of intangible assets based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value its fair value is determined based on projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model the estimates of future cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the audited consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes we evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period the income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings 

accounting for stockbased employee compensation plans 

stockbased compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and nonemployee directors is determined based on the grantdate fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest we recognize these compensation costs on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award which is generally the option vesting term of four years 

we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures or vesting differ from those estimates such revisions could have a material effect on our operating results the assumptions used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly stockbased compensation for future awards may differ materially compared to the awards previously granted 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv “item 15 exhibits financial statement schedules — audited consolidated financial statements” regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our audited consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

concentration of credit and other risk 

financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues these financial instruments approximate fair value due to shortterm maturities we maintain our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments with financial institutions we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties and accordingly do not require collateral 

trade accounts receivable and unbilled revenues are generally dispersed across our clients in proportion to the revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 our top five clients accounted for 320 and 297 revenues respectively one client thomson reuters accounted for over 10 of revenues in 2011 and 2010 accounts receivable for this client were 159 and 169 of total accounts receivable as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively unbilled revenues for this client were 150 and 239 of total unbilled revenues as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

credit losses and writeoffs of trade accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our audited consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our revolving line of credit bearing interest at libor plus 125 rate we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our risk of interest rate volatility 

we have not been exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates however our future interest expense may increase and interest income may fall due to changes in market interest rates 

foreign exchange risk 

our audited consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars however we generate a significant portion of our revenues in certain nonus dollar currencies principally euros british pounds and russian rubles we incur expenditures in nonus dollar currencies principally in hungarian forints euros and russian rubles associated with our delivery centers located in cee we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily on accounts receivable and unbilled revenues from sales in these foreign currencies and cash flows for expenditures in foreign currencies we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of foreign exchange volatility our results of operations can be affected if the euro andor the british pound appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues and expenses based on our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 a 10 appreciation  depreciation of the euro against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase  decrease of approximately 03 million in net income and 10 appreciation  depreciation of the british pound against the us dollar would result in an estimated increase  decrease of approximately 02 million in net income 

to the extent that we need to convert us dollars into foreign currencies for our operations appreciation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar would adversely affect the amount of such foreign currencies we receive from the conversion sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations the analysis quantifies the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period most commonly within a oneyear period the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices

 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

the purpose of this compensation discussion and analysis section is to provide information about the material elements of compensation that are paid or awarded to or earned by our named executive officers or neos whose compensation is set forth in the “— 2011 summary compensation table” below our named executive officers for 2011 were 

 

  

   

  

  

 compensation philosophy and objectives 

our philosophy is to provide compensation to each of our neos that is commensurate with his or her position and experience furnish incentives sufficient for the neo to meet and exceed shortterm and longterm corporate objectives and align these officers’ incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders additionally our executive compensation program is intended to provide significant motivation for each of our neos to remain employed by us unless and until our board of directors andor other than for mr dobkin our ceo finds that retention of the neo is no longer in accord with our corporate objectives 

based on this philosophy the primary objectives of our board of directors and compensation committee with respect to executive compensation are to 

 

  

  

 to achieve these objectives our compensation committee periodically evaluates our executive compensation program with the goal of establishing compensation at levels it believes to be generally competitive with other companies in our geographical regions that compete with us for executive talent we believe that our program is competitive based on our ability to attract talented employees and our general sense of the compensation market as discussed in greater detail below the compensation committee does not engage in benchmarking or a formal peer group analysis but does review publicly available compensation information from time to time additionally we design our executive compensation program to tie a portion of each neo’s overall cash compensation to key strategic financial and operational performance considered by our board of directors 

we use a mix of shortterm compensation in the form of base salaries and cash bonuses and longterm compensation in the form of equity awards as the total compensation structure to meet these objectives this compensation program serves to complement the strong stockholder incentives that exist as a result of the significant equity interests several of our neos have in the company as we were a nonpublic company in 2011 we were not required to hold a shareholder advisory “sayonpay” vote 

historical compensation decisions 

historically our compensation programs have aimed to conserve cash while attracting and retaining executive officers who are highly motivated to grow our business in the long term as with other companies in the information technology services sector generally we have emphasized equity compensation primarily in the form of stock options to supplement cash compensation in the form of base salaries and bonuses mr dobkin has not been awarded stock options due to his direct equity holdings our board of directors and compensation committee sought to align the interests of management and stockholders by motivating the management team through the granting of equity compensation to grow our business in the long term we expect to continue to emphasize this approach in the future 

our compensation committee is responsible for establishing and administering executive officer compensation including salaries bonuses and equity incentive compensation our ceo served on our compensation committee prior to our initial public offering which closed in february 2012 and in connection with which he stepped down from the compensation committee mr dobkin provided substantial input in determining compensation paid to our neos other than for himself for our ceo the compensation committee 

  

evaluates his performance to determine his compensation mr dobkin is not present at the meetings where his compensation is determined the compensation committee uses its judgment and experience as well as the recommendations of the ceo to determine the appropriate amount and mix of compensation for each other neo the company does not engage in benchmarking or a formal peer group analysis in determining the amount or components of executive compensation awarded to our neos in considering compensation we engage in an informal process of looking at the compensation practices of other companies in our industry for perspective however we do not target our compensation to fit within ranges relative to such companies 

to comply with rule 16b3 under the exchange act we expect equity incentive compensation for executive officers to be approved on the recommendation of the compensation committee by a committee of our directors who qualify as “nonemployee directors” or the full board of directors pursuant to the rule 

except as described below neither the board of directors nor the compensation committee has adopted any formal or informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between cash and noncash compensation among different forms of noncash compensation or with respect to long and shortterm performance the determination of our board of directors or compensation committee as to the appropriate use and weight of each component of executive compensation is subjective based on their view of the relative importance of each component in meeting our overall objectives and factors relevant to the individual executive 

as a publicly held company we may periodically engage the services of a compensation consultant to assist us in further aligning our compensation philosophy with our corporate objectives in addition in order to attract and retain key executives we may be required to modify individual executive compensation levels to remain competitive in the market for such positions 

elements of compensation 

each neo’s compensation package is tailored to each individual and is intended to encourage executive performance that supports our organizational strategy when setting the amount of compensation to be awarded to our neos other than our ceo in a given year the compensation committee considers the recommendations of our ceo as well as the relative proportion of total compensation delivered on a current and longterm basis and in the form of cash and equity prior to making changes to compensation levels the compensation of our ceo is determined by the compensation committee following a review of company and individual performance rather than through the use of predetermined performance metrics 

the fundamental elements of our compensation program are 

 

  

  

  

 although we expect these to remain the elements of our compensation program going forward the relative weighting of each element and specific plan and award designs may evolve as we grow as a public company mr robb is retained as a consultant to the company and his consulting fees which include both a fixed payment and a variable payment are paid directly to his direct employer landmark business development limited mr fejes is employed in part by a subsidiary of the company for which service he receives a base salary and in part as a consultant to the company mr fejes’ consulting fees which include both a fixed payment and a variable payment are paid directly to his direct employer redlodge holdings limited however stock option awards are granted directly to mr robb and mr fejes 

  

base salary 

base salary is the main “fixed” component of our executive compensation program for our usbased neos in 2011 messrs robb and fejes each received a fixed consulting fee for their services to the company as consultants and mr fejes also received a base salary the base salaries of our neos andor fixed consulting fees in the case of messrs robb and fejes for 2011 were determined by the compensation committee in consultation with our ceo taking into consideration the qualifications experience and 2010 compensation level of each neo and the particular responsibilities and expectations associated with each neo’s position 

the base salaries andor fixed consulting fees expressed in us dollars for the named executive officers in 2011 are set forth in the table below in addition for 2012 the compensation committee has approved base salaries andor fixed consulting fees in the amounts set forth in the table below 

 

  

       

annual cash bonus 

in addition to the base salary we believe that it is important to incentivize shortterm performance by compensating our named executive officers based upon their individual accomplishments and the general performance of the company under their leadership 

for 2011 the overall bonus pool and the individual bonus payments and variable consulting fees were not based on formulaic performance metrics instead bonuses or variable consulting fees were awarded on a discretionary basis by our ceo other than for himself in consultation with the compensation committee generally based on the company’s performance combined with an objective and subjective evaluation of individual performance the amount of our ceo’s 2011 bonus was determined by the compensation committee based on company and individual performance the aggregate amount of the bonus payments and variable consulting fees paid to our neos in 2011 represented 04 of revenues we believe the responsible exercise of discretion and consideration of a broad range of factors enables us to retain the flexibility to appropriately reward individual performance while conserving the cash we need as a public company for operational purposes 

the following table sets forth the amounts of the annual bonuses or variable consulting fees earned by our neos in 2011 

 

  

 the amount of each of the bonuses or variable consulting fees was determined based on the following companywide performance 

 

  

  

 in addition the bonus or variable consulting fee for each of our neos was based on the following considerations of individual performance 

 

  

  

  

   

 in addition in june 2011 ms mosier received a special bonus in the amount of 10000 for her work related to the preparation of our registration statement on form s1 related to our initial public offering 

equity awards 

historical equity awards 

to reward and retain our neos in a manner that best aligns their interests with stockholders’ interests we use stock options as the primary incentive vehicles for longterm compensation we believe that stock options are an effective tool for meeting our compensation goal of increasing longterm stockholder value because the value of the stock options is tied to our future performance because employees are able to profit from stock options only if our stock price increases relative to the stock option’s exercise price we believe stock options provide meaningful incentives to employees to achieve increases in the value of our stock over time in addition stock option awards generally vest ratably over four years which enhances their retentive value 

we generally use stock options to compensate our neos both in the form of initial grants in connection with the commencement of employment and additional or “refresher” grants in 2011 however our neos did not receive any equity grants 

in 2010 ms mosier received an option award in connection with the commencement of her employment mr cantor received a refresher grant and messrs fejes and robb each received an option grant for the first time as part of their total compensation to date there has been no set program for the award of refresher grants and our compensation committee retains discretion to make stock option awards to employees at any time on the recommendation of our ceo including in connection with the promotion of an employee to reward an employee’s performance for retention purposes or for other circumstances recommended by management 

in 2010 stock option grants were made under the 2006 stock option plan or the 2006 plan to our neos in the amounts set forth in the table below 

 

 the stock options granted to our neos in 2010 vest in equal installments of 25 on each of january 1 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 under the terms of the 2006 plan the compensation committee has the discretion to accelerate the vesting of these stock options in the event of a change in control of the company although mr dobkin was not granted any stock options in 2010 he has a sizable direct stock ownership in the company 

2012 awards and 2012 long term incentive plan 

on january 16 2012 we granted 194800 shares of restricted stock to mr robb these restricted shares vested 25 on january 16 2012 and are scheduled to vest 25 on each of january 1 2013 2014 and 2015 on termination of mr robb’s service to the company with cause or without good reason in each case as defined in the award agreement any unvested restricted shares will be forfeited in addition under the restricted stock award agreement mr robb is subject to perpetual confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations as well as noncompetition and employee and customer nonsolicitation obligations that survive for a period of 12 months after the termination of service to the company 

  

on january 11 2012 we adopted our 2012 long term incentive plan or the 2012 plan which permits us to grant stock options restricted stock restricted stock units or other types of equity awards to employees of the company including our neos as the compensation committee deems appropriate 

on march 19 2012 we made equity grants of servicevesting nonqualified stock options to messrs fejes and cantor and ms mosier “2012 grants” pursuant to awards issued under the 2012 plan as part or our annual compensation process the stock options have an exercise price of 1680 which is the closing price of a share of our common stock on the trading day prior to the grant date 

the following table sets forth the amounts of stock option grants made to our neos on march 19 2012 

 

 the following terms apply to the 2012 grants these stock options will vest 25 on each of march 19 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 and will expire on march 19 2022 the tenth anniversary of the grant date the options are not transferable prior to exercise other than by laws of descent or distribution or in connection with any award transfer program adopted by us after exercise the shares are transferable subject to any applicable lock up agreement and securities laws 

if an neo’s employment or service terminates due to death or disability see definition below unless otherwise determined by our compensation committee or our board of directors in its sole discretion unvested stock options covered by the 2012 grant will be forfeited and vested options will remain exercisable for one year following such termination if an neo’s employment or service is terminated by us for cause see definition below unexercised options covered by the 2012 grant whether vested or unvested will be forfeited if an neo’s employment or service is terminated by us without cause or by the neo for good reason see definition below on or within two years after a change in control see definition below any unvested options will vest and the options will remain exercisable for 90 days if an neo’s employment or service is terminated for any other reason unless otherwise determined by our compensation committee or our board of directors in its sole discretion unvested options will be forfeited and vested options will remain exercisable for 90 days 

“disability” generally means “disability” as defined in the executive’s employment or consulting agreement or if not so defined except as otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement 

 

  

 “cause” generally means our good faith determination of the executive’s 

 

  

   

  

  

 in the case of the executive’s willful breach or habitual neglect of his or her duties or obligations willful misconduct gross negligence or a breach of fiduciary duty or the executive’s willful breach of his or her employment or consulting agreement or any of our policies we will provide the executive with written notice specifying the circumstances alleged to constitute cause and if possible the executive will have 30 days following receipt of such notice to cure such circumstances 

“good reason” generally means “good reason” as defined in the executive’s employment or consulting agreement if any or if not so defined the occurrence of any of the following events in each case without the executive’s consent 

 

  

  

 in each case the executive must provide us with written notice specifying the circumstances alleged to constitute good reason within 90 days following the first occurrence of such circumstances and if possible we will have 30 days following receipt of such notice to cure such circumstances if we have not cured such circumstances within such 30day period the executive must terminate his or her employment or service not later than 60 days after the end of such 30day period 

“change in control” generally means the occurrence any one or more of the following events 

 

  

  

  

   

perquisites 

we do not provide significant perquisites to our neos because we believe that our compensation objectives are better achieved as a result of the compensation elements described above however there is no firm policy against the provision of such perquisites and our current stance on perquisites may be reevaluated at a later date as necessary to ensure that we can attract retain and properly motivate our neos 

retirement and other broadbased employee benefits 

we have established a 401k retirement plan which is a taxqualified self funded retirement plan in which our us employees including messrs dobkin and cantor and ms mosier may participate we do not make any employer contributions to the 401k retirement plan other benefits in which our us employees including messrs dobkin and cantor and ms mosier may participate include group health insurance including medical dental and vision long and short term disability group life add and paid time off mr robb receives lump sum cash payments in amounts sufficient to cover the cost of obtaining health insurance mr fejes receives health insurance benefits and a pension contribution that is mandatory under swiss law we do not maintain any defined benefit pension plans or any nonqualified deferred compensation plans although as noted above we do make pension plan contributions for mr fejes under swiss law 

compensation risk assessment 

our management team has reviewed our compensation policies and practices for all of our employees with our board of directors the board of directors has determined based on this review that our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company 

severance and change in control arrangements 

during 2011 none of our neos were entitled to protections on a termination of employment or service or a change in control as a result the termination of employment of a neo andor a change in control would not have entitled any neo to the acceleration of any unvested equity interest or any other payments or benefits however as noted above on a change in control the compensation committee may in its discretion accelerate the vesting of any unvested stock options issued under the 2006 plan 

employment agreements and other arrangements 

although they are not currently party to employment or consulting agreements with us other than a standard employment agreement that mr fejes has entered into with a swiss subentity under swiss law pursuant to the terms of the consultancy agreements previously entered into messrs robb and fejes are subject to certain confidentiality obligations that survived the expiration of those agreements under such obligations messrs robb and fejes agree that they will not disclose any confidential information relating to us or our business and assign to us their rights to any intellectual property developed within the course of their service to us mr dobkin is subject to similar confidentiality obligations pursuant to an employment agreement he previously entered into and which has since expired and that is briefly described below under “— potential payments on termination and change in control” 

in addition ms mosier and mr cantor each entered into a nondisclosure and nonsolicitation agreement in connection with the commencement of their respective employment pursuant to these agreements ms mosier and mr cantor are subject to perpetual confidentiality obligations and employee and customer nonsolicitation obligations that survive for a period of 12 months after the termination of employment mr fejes also entered into an agreement in connection with his option grant under which he is subject to a perpetual nondisclosure obligation and nonsolicitation and noncompete obligations which survive for a period of 12 months after the 

  

termination of employment mr robb is subject to certain noncompetition nonsolicitation and nondisclosure obligations set forth in his restricted stock agreement see “— elements of compensation — equity awards” 

tax deductibility of executive compensation 

section 162m of the internal revenue code or the code limits to 1 million the federal income tax deduction for compensation paid to any named executive officer of a publicly held corporation other than the chief financial officer compensation in excess of 1 million a year may nonetheless be deducted if such compensation is “performance based” within the meaning of the code as a newly public company our compensation plans and arrangements are generally exempt from the application of section 162m until our 2016 annual meeting of shareholders 

to the extent 162m does apply to any compensation paid by the company we expect that although we will consider deductibility when structuring the compensation arrangements of our neos we may in certain circumstances award compensation that is not deductible when such payments are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent 

other provisions of the code can also affect compensation decisions section 409a of the code which governs the form and timing of payment of deferred compensation imposes sanctions including a 20 penalty and an interest penalty on the recipient of deferred compensation that does not comply with section 409a the compensation committee will take into account the implications of section 409a in determining the form and timing of compensation awarded to our executives and will strive to structure any nonqualified deferred compensation plans or arrangements to be exempt from or to comply with the requirements of section 409a 

section 280g of the code disallows a company’s tax deduction for payments received by certain individuals in connection with a change in control to the extent that the payments exceed an amount approximately three times their average annual compensation and section 4999 of the code imposes a 20 excise tax on those payments the compensation committee will take into account the implications of section 280g in determining potential payments to be made to our executives in connection with a change in control nevertheless to the extent that certain payments upon a change in control are classified as excess parachute payments such payments may not be deductible pursuant to section 280g
